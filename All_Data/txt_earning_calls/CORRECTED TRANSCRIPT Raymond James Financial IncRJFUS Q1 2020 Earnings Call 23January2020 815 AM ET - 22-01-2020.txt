During today's call, we also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our
management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most
comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our press release and presentation.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?

Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Kristie. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. During this call, if you hear me refer to Paul, I'm
not referring to myself in the third person because Paul Shoukry has now taken over the CFO reins and will be
going over that part of the call.
As usual, I'll give an overview and I'm going to turn it over to Paul who will cover more of the detail and update our
guidance. As we indicated on our last call, before the interest rate changes, we were going to hold off on
guidance until those rate cuts were announced and we knew how deep they would be. After that, Paul will then
turn it over to me to discuss the outlook.
So, overall, I'm really pleased with our results for the first quarter especially given the significant headwinds from
the three recent interest rate cuts, which will have an estimated negative impact on our pre-tax earnings of
approximately $140 million annually.
As outlined on slide 3, we generated quarterly net revenues of $2 billion which were up 4% from the prior year's
fiscal first quarter and down 1% from the record set in the preceding quarter. We generated record quarterly net
income of $268 million or $1.89 per diluted share.
On an annualized basis, our return on equity for the quarter was 16%. And while, as you know, we've been
reluctant to disclose this metric because we believe return on total equity is the most relevant, and we do not have
any preferred equity, we are now disclosing return on tangible common equity or ROTCE as that has become a
common metric in our industry.
On an annualized basis, we generated a 17.5% return on tangible common equity during the quarter, which we
believe is very attractive especially given our strong capital position.
On slide 4, you can see that in addition to the strong financial results this quarter, we also achieved records for
most of our key business metrics, including client assets under administration of $896 billion, PCG assets in fee-
based accounts of $444.2 billion, financial assets under management of $151.7 billion, total PCG financial
advisors of 8,060, and net loans at RJ Bank of $21.3 billion.
While equity market appreciation certainly contributed to the growth of client asset metrics, we also believe that
the substantial growth, for example, 31% year-over-year and 9% sequential increases in PCG assets in fee-based
accounts reflect significant increases in market share that have been driven by our consistent industry-leading
strong retention and recruiting of Private Client Group financial advisors.
For example, for the firms that have already reported, the year-over-year increases in fee-based assets have
ranged 18% to 23%, well below our year-over-year growth. Clients' domestic cash balances which ended the
quarter at $39.5 billion were down 16% year-over-year from the high watermark reached in the following – in the
quarter a year ago because of the surge in market volatility in December of 2018. But we're up 5% sequentially
partially due to year-end tax planning positioning. Client cash balances appear to stabilize over the last several

months. But remember, at the beginning of each quarter, we have the impact of quarterly fee billings, and in the
first calendar quarter we typically see seasonal declines in cash balances due to income tax payments.
Now, let's turn to the segment results starting on slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net
revenues of $1.4 billion primarily driven by the aforementioned growth of assets in fee-based accounts, which was
partially offset by the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates, net interest income and RJBDP fees from
third-party banks. Quarterly net income for the segment was $153 million, down 7% on a year-over-year basis but
up 7% sequentially.
The year-over-year declines in pre-tax income was largely due to the decrease in net interest income and RJBDP
fees from third-party banks, which was due to the lower short-term interest rates as Paul Shoukry will discuss in
much more detail. The sequential improvement in the segment's pre-tax income was driven by higher revenues
and lower non-comp expenses. And again, Paul will discuss these after I finish this part.
Most importantly, on the bottom of the slide, you can see very positive trends for client assets and in the number
of advisors, which grew to 8,060 despite the elevated number of planned retirements that are typical each
December quarter. For example, in that quarter alone, there were 69 advisors who retired or left the business
during the quarter wherein most cases we retained substantially all of the client assets.
Our net additions of financial advisors during the quarter was particularly impressive compared to other firms in
our industry who have reported so far – as most all have reported decreases in net advisors year-over-year and
sequentially. But even more impressive the net addition of advisors is quality of the advisors joining Raymond
James. We are attracting very large high-quality practices including some in the $5 million to $10 million range.
Over the past four quarters, financial advisors with over $300 million of trailing 12 production and over $40 billion
of assets at their prior firms have affiliated with Raymond James which is a spectacular result, and our recruiting
pipeline continues to be robust across all of our affiliation options.
Moving to slide 6, the Capital Markets segment had mixed results during the quarter as revenue and pre-tax
income were up year-over-year basis but down sequentially compared to the fiscal fourth quarter. Fixed income
brokerage revenue and both equity and debt underwriting revenues were strong during the quarter. On the other
hand, M&A revenues and equity brokerage revenues were down from the year ago quarter.
On the next slide, Asset Management segment generated record quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income, and
financial assets under management reached a record of $151.7 billion, increases of 20% on a year-over-year
basis and 6% sequentially. These record results were driven by equity market appreciation, the net addition of
financial advisors and PCG, and increased utilization of fee-based accounts, which more than offset the modest
net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers during the quarter.
On slide 8, Raymond James Bank eked out record quarterly net revenues of $216 million, a slightly higher than
the preceding quarter as loan growth helped offset the 7 basis points sequential decline in the bank's net interest
income margin caused again by lower short-term interest rates. Pre-tax income was up 23% on a year-over-year
basis and 3% sequentially helped by the loan loss benefit of $2 million for the quarter.
Despite loan growth and an uptick in criticized loans during the quarter, a higher concentration of residential
mortgage which carries lower allowance than C&I loans on an average and payoffs of certain lower rated
corporate loans resulted in the loan loss benefit. Net loans ended the quarter at a record $21.3 billion which was
up 7% over December of 2018 and 2% over September 2019.

Now, I'll turn over the call to Paul, Paul Shoukry, who will provide more detail on the financial results. Paul?

Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks. Before jumping into the numbers, I just want to thank Jeff Julien who's sitting in the room with us this
morning. Jeff has been a fantastic mentor and friend over the past several years. And certainly have big shoes to
fill, but fortunately Jeff has agreed to stick around for a year to help me with the transition. So thank you, Jeff.

Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Want to point out that in addition to the presentation we're using for this call, we also provided a financial
supplement for the first time this quarter which provides similar metrics as our earnings release but over five
rolling quarters. I'll also point out some other requested additions to our disclosures throughout my prepared
remarks. As always, thanks to all of you for your feedback and suggestions to help us continuously enhance our
disclosures,
Starting with revenues on slide 10, as Paul stated, we generated quarterly net revenues of $2 billion which were
up 4% on a year-over-year basis and down 1% compared to the record achieved in the preceding quarter.
Notably, about 75% of our net revenues are asset based, providing relatively good predictability.
Asset management fees were up 10% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially, consistent with the 3%
sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts in the preceding quarter. Assets in fee-based accounts were
up a substantial 9% during the fiscal first quarter, which will be reflected in the Private Client Group segment in
the second quarter as most of these assets are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on balances at the
end of the preceding quarter.
Also remember, about 13% of this line item is driven by financial assets under management, primarily in the Asset
Management segment, which are built based on a combination of beginning, ending and average assets
throughout the quarter. Given one fewer billing day in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the 6%
sequential increase in financial assets under management, we would expect asset management fees to grow
somewhere around 7% to 8% next quarter on a sequential basis.
Brokerage revenues during the quarter of $460 million were pretty healthy as fixed income brokerage revenues
were strong again this quarter. While brokerage revenues in PCG and institutional equity brokerage revenues
improved on a sequential basis, they were both still pretty subdued as PCG brokerage commissions are
negatively impacted by the shift to fee-based accounts and there are cyclical and structural headwinds impacting
equity brokerage revenues across the industry, particularly for a firm like ours that do not take as much balance
sheet risk.
Account and service fees of $178 million were down 4% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. The
decline compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2019 was largely attributable to the removal of the money market
sweep option last June, which is reflected in the Asset Management segment as well as lower RJBDP fees from

third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates and lower average cash balances, which I will discuss in
more detail in the next two slides. Partially offsetting those items was an increase in mutual fund and annuity
service fees attributable to more mutual fund positions and higher mutual fund balances.
Investment banking revenues of $141 million were up 3% compared to last year's first quarter but down 10%
compared to the preceding quarter. Debt underwriting and equity underwriting revenues were both strong, but
M&A revenues declined on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. As you may recall, in fiscal year 2019, we
generated approximately $600 million of investment banking revenues which was a record that was up 19% from
the prior year's record. Given how strong our investment banking revenues were last year, we would be pleased
to match that result this year assuming market conditions remain conducive, which would result in an average of
about $150 million of investment banking revenues per quarter. So, we have some catching up to do after the first
quarter.
I'll discuss net interest income in the next two slides. But quickly on Other revenues, which were down
substantially this quarter, the two primary drivers for the decline in Other revenues were lower tax credit fund
revenues, which had a very strong fourth quarter and a modest valuation loss on private equity investments in the
Other segment compared to gains in both the fiscal first quarter and fourth quarter of 2019.
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our
interest earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended the quarter at
$39.5 billion, representing 4.9% of domestic PCG client assets, which is a record low as far back as we have the
data. These balances have stabilized since the fiscal third quarter of 2019 and increased 5% during the first
quarter partially due to tax positioning that is typical at the end of the calendar year. Unless we encounter
elevated market volatility, we expect pressure on these balances in the fiscal second quarter due to the quarterly
fee billings and income tax payments.
On slide 12, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis, as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term rates. As you can see, the
three rate cuts totaling 75 basis points since August has put pressure on these revenue streams which, on a
combined basis, are down $25 million from the high watermark in the fiscal second quarter of 2019, and that's
despite loan growth at Raymond James Bank.
On the bottom right portion of the slide, we provided a new disclosure that many of you have been requesting.
During the quarter, the average yield on RJBDP fees from third-party banks was 1.64%. Prior to the three rate
cuts, the average yield reached 2% in the fiscal second quarter of 2019, which means the deposit beta averaged
approximately 50% for those last three rate cuts. Given the current level of clients' domestic cash sweep
balances, the reduction of our spread of 36 basis points, 2% down to 1.64%, roughly equates to an annual pre-tax
earnings impact of approximately $140 million.
Now, this is based on oversimplified math because obviously a good portion of these balances are used to fund
the bank's balance sheet where loan spreads vary and there is some duration. Those dynamics are reflected on
the NIM graph on the bottom left portion of the slide. But based on the oversimplified math, $140 million would
represent approximately 10% of our adjusted pre-tax income in fiscal year 2019 and would reflect a negative
impact of approximately 100 to 150 basis points to the comp ratio in pre-tax margin which we'll discuss more on
the next slide.
Raymond James Bank's net interest margin declined 7 basis points from the preceding quarter to 3.23%. If short-
term rates remain constant, we would expect the bank's NIM to remain at around the same level in the second

quarter, assuming a similar asset mix as the negative impact from the higher mix of lower risk and lower-yielding
residential mortgages should largely be offset by a reduction in the cash sweep rates we are making this week
which will average around 5 basis points and leave us near the top end of the competitive rates. Similarly, we
would expect the average yield on RJBDP fees from third-party banks to remain around 1.6% to 1.65%.
Now, I'll discuss expenses on slide 13. First, let me spend a few minutes on compensation expense which is by
far our largest expense. The compensation ratio increased sequentially from 65.2% to 67.2%. This increase was
largely driven by revenue mix. As compensable revenues in PCG, those which have an associated advisor payout
have grown to be a higher portion of net revenues while non-compensable revenues have declined as a portion of
net revenues.
As I covered on the prior slide, the decrease in short-term interest rates has pressured a significant portion of the
non-compensable revenues. Meanwhile, compensable revenues in the Private Client Group, which include asset
management fees, brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues in the segment, were up 3%
sequentially. These revenues have an average payout between our affiliation options of approximately 75%. So,
when PCG's compensable revenues increase faster than other revenue sources, you should expect the
compensation ratio to increase just as it decreased substantially when rates increased from 2015 through 2018.
To help you better understand this dynamic, we started breaking out PCG financial advisor compensation and
benefits in the earnings release and supplement which represented $25 million of the $31 million sequential
increase in the firm's total compensation during the quarter, a roughly 80% of the overall increase. This dynamic
is expected to continue into the fiscal second quarter as assets in fee-based accounts were up 9% during the
fiscal first quarter. Given the growth of financial advisor compensation and the reset of payroll taxes at the
beginning of each calendar year, we would expect the compensation ratio to be somewhere around 67.5% for the
fiscal year. This represents a 100-basis-point increase over our prior target. But again, this adjustment is primarily
a function of lower short-term interest rates and the change in revenue mix to a larger portion of compensable
revenues in PCG.
On to non-compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses during the quarter were $299 million which
declined 14% from the preceding quarter and included – that preceding quarter included a $19 million goodwill
impairment and 10% from the year-ago quarter, which included a $15 million loss associated with the disposition
of our European equities research business. Given the loan loss benefit and the fact that there were no major
recognition events or conferences during the quarter, we would expect non-compensation expenses to increase
throughout the year. More specifically, while there are a lot of variables, we're currently estimating that non-
compensation expenses in fiscal 2020 will total around $1.3 billion or an average of about $325 million per
quarter.
But as we experienced in the first quarter, we also expect a wide range around this target from quarter-to-quarter.
And if revenue growth is higher than expected, that could drive non-compensation expenses higher as well as
certain line items such as sub-advisory fee expense are directly tied to revenue growth. $1.3 billion of non-
compensation expenses in fiscal 2020 would represent approximately 2% growth over fiscal 2019, which included
the two aforementioned non-GAAP items. We believe this would be a good result particularly given the amount of
growth we are experiencing as we are extremely focused on containing expense growth as much as possible
while still investing for the future.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. The pre-tax margin was 17.9% in the fiscal
first quarter of 2020. Given the expense guidance I just provided, we would expect the pre-tax margin to be
around 17% for fiscal 2020, reflecting a 100-basis-point decline from the target that we provided at our Analyst &
7

Investor Day before the three recent short-term rate cuts. Again, this is our best estimate given what we know
right now and we all know things can change rapidly in our business.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters where we returned over $1 billion
back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the board's authorization. We only repurchased
11 million of shares in the fiscal first quarter, but we remain committed to at least offsetting stock-based
compensation dilution which is approximately $150 million to $200 million per year. Furthermore, as we exhibited
last year given our strong capital and liquidity position, we will also consider significantly increasing our
repurchases if the stock price dips to opportunistic levels which we have stated starts at around 1.8 times book
value. We currently have $739 million of remaining share repurchase authorization.
In summary, given the growth of our capital which is already very strong we're going to increase our focus on
utilizing and/or deploying our capital whether it be through higher dividends, being more aggressive with our
buybacks, pursuing corporate development opportunities, or accelerating the growth of our balance sheet, for
example, by growing the bank securities portfolio much more rapidly.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly, to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Paul, and thanks for a lot of guidance update there. But, again, as you recall from our last call, we said
given the upcoming interest rate changes we couldn't predict, we would hold off till this quarter. And you can see
most of these changes were just caused by the interest rate changes.
So we provided as much detail. Typically we would do it at an Investor & Analyst Day so we could explain things
in person, but given the cuts since our last call, we felt it was time to update it sooner than later.
In summary, we had three rate cuts since our last Analyst & Investor Day in June, which has an impact on our
pre-tax income about $140 million. So we needed to adjust our comp ratio and pre-tax margin targets by 100
basis points.
Unlike many of the other firms, we're in growth mode in almost all of our businesses and there are expenses
associated with growth. For example, we've been consistently adding financial advisors on a net basis, whereas
most of the larger firms have consistently been losing advisors on a net basis. That creates a very different
dynamic for our expense trajectory as we are adding to our transition assistance and retention amortization
reflected in the compensation. But that alone is about $265 million in 2019, representing 3.5% net revenues, and
$100 million larger than just four years prior.
We're also adding support at the branches and at the home office, expanding the size of our branch footprint,
paying internal and external recruiters, paying for ACAT fees to transfer in accounts and so on.
Growth is expensive, but we believe it represents a very good long-term result for our shareholders. And given
this growth, I think a 2% growth in non-comp expenses is a good expense management.
With the benefit of hindsight, we probably could have done a better job explaining our expense growth over the
past three years as we've been investing heavily not just in our technology but in our compliance and supervision
infrastructure, originally to get ready for the DOL role which has since been vacated, but also to support the future
growth in a responsible manner by improving our solutions for advisors and their clients.

And now I'm really glad we did make those investments, as the SEC's Best Interest Standard is out and other
fiduciary requirements become effective this year. If we had not made those significant investments over the past
few years such as implementing Mantas and Actimize and other technologies for AML compliance and
supervision, we would have struggled more in our implementation efforts for Regulation VI. But I believe we are in
the late stages of that infrastructure and personnel buildout which is why we are confident we'll be able to
decelerate our expense growth going forward despite the significant growth we're experiencing across our
businesses.
Importantly, once we complete the buildout, we will be able to support a much larger number of financial advisors
and clients on our infrastructure, which should result in scale economies over time. And that growth really starts
with the Private Client Group, which is obviously our largest business. We are consistently producing best-in-class
growth in this business. As I said earlier, over the past four quarters, financial advisors with 300-plus million
dollars of production and $40 billion of assets at their prior firms have affiliated with Raymond James. And our
recruiting pipeline remains very strong across all of our affiliation options.
This quarter represents a better start than last year's first quarter where we were flattish in the number of
advisors. The first quarter of every year has significant number of retirements, which is typical at year end. We're
off to a good start with this quarter averaging above last year's quarterly average.
The strong recruiting, and most importantly, our strong retention of existing advisors has helped PCG assets in
fee-based accounts grow 31% on a year-over-year basis and 9% on a sequential basis, which is among the very
best result, if not the best result we've seen in our industry on an organic basis. The 9% sequential growth is
expected to provide a nice tailwind to our revenues in the fiscal second quarter.
In Capital Markets, we've become accustomed to M&A achieving new records each year as we've been investing
heavily in that business. Activity levels in our banking business are still healthy, but we'd be very happy if we
could match last year's $600 million in fiscal 2020.
On the sales and trading side, we are still seeing positive trends on fixed income side of the business but we
expect the equity side of the business to remain challenged as business continues to shift to low-touch trading
and balance sheet providers.
The Asset Management business could continue to benefit from the growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the
Private Client Group segment, which has offset the challenging flow environment for Carillon Tower Advisers due
to the shift from actively managed products to passively managed products. We are entering the second quarter
with fiscal assets under management up 20% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
In Raymond James Bank, we are continuing to experience very strong loan growth in the Private Client Group,
particular residential mortgages given the low rate environment. While residential mortgages have lower yields
than our corporate loans, they have the dual benefit of having very attractive risk-adjusted returns while also
strengthening our client relationships. Given where we are in the market cycle, we will continue to be extremely
selective with loan growth particularly in the corporate loan categories.
On capital, as Paul Shoukry explained, we are fully committed deploying our excess capital. We have been
extremely engaged on evaluating corporate development opportunities but pricing in many of these has continued
to be a challenge at this point in the market cycle. We will continue pursuing those opportunities in a deliberate
9


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
manner but also be more aggressive in our other capital levers including repurchases or growing the balance
sheet.
So, overall, I'm cautiously optimistic entering the second quarter as we have had record client assets, a record
number of financial advisors, a record net loans at RJ Bank. The activity levels for financial advisor recruiting
remain strong, investment banking pipelines remain healthy. But given lower short-term interest rates and how far
we are into the bull market, the longest ever, we are still being focused on managing expenses.
So, with that, I'm going to open it up to questions and turn it over to Myra. Myra?

Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
So, I had a question on recruiting. I mean, you grew your advisors a healthy 3% clip over the last year and you did
have some retirements in the fourth quarter. But can you provide a little more color on where those advisors are
coming from and if you're seeing increasing competition for advisors from the different groups like the wirehouses
and other independent brokers? And also, why are a lot of those big banks failing in the competition for advisors
also?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, I think it's just a shift in philosophy that Raymond James has a platform where we still have the advisors as
our clients. We give them an environment that allows them to do what's best for their clients and with no product
push. We have no quotas on any product. Managers don't have any incentives. I mean, we really want advisors to
do what's best for them. So, we've had an attractive platform for a long time and I think today leading technology.
And I think the banks, as they've tightened some of the – both their payouts, their structures, and a lot of advisors
feel like there's less flexibility. They've been leaving not just for us but for other places. So, I think the regional

firms and us have been the beneficiary at the cost of the larger wirehouse firms. And that trajectory has
continued. So, that's where most of the recruiting has come. It's from the wirehouse firms.
We don't see any slowdown in backlog. Last year was a near record from the year before and we're kind of on the
same pace. So, whether it's a record or shorter record, I don't know. But as of today, we still see the same interest
in backlog and growth. So that's been our strategy for a number of years and we don't see it changing in the
short-term to mid-term.

Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the puts and takes in the non-comp line. I know you mentioned that, for
the full year, the non-comp line should be around $1.3 billion. But I was wondering, how much room you have in
the longer term, maybe over the next couple of years to bring that line down a little bit. And maybe you can talk to
some of the puts and takes by line?

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I can give you an overview, and I'll let Paul talked about the puts and takes. You've seen that line really taken
away the accounting change last year, really decelerating over the last couple of years. So last year was a
deceleration and this year there's been a further deceleration. But again, sometimes with the accounting change
where we had to grow some expenses on revenue recognition, some people lose on that.
So we continue to manage it down, and we think we've become better and more efficient with the systems and
actually the systems investing actually help the advisors also with their client management. So that's been the
relationship. The large build-up started really a few years ago and it's been decelerating now.
Paul, you want to talk about any particular line item?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. And to add more color to what Paul stated, last year the non-comp expenses grew 9% as
reported, but over half of that was due to non-GAAP items in the prior year as well as the gross-up of expenses
due to revenue recognition. So, if you look at kind of the apples to apples that represented a significant
deceleration, and we're looking to kind of maintain a non-comp expense growth around the same level this year to
get to the $1.3 billion.
Obviously, it started off low in the first quarter just given the loan loss credit and other items. Business
development was relatively low given no conferences or recognition trips [ph] sized (00:36:07). And we expect
that to sort of build up throughout the year. But the last thing I would say on this is a lot of these lines, investment,
sub-advisory fees, professional fees associated with banking deals, et cetera, are directly tied to revenue growth.
So, as much as we want to contain the growth that we can contain, we also want to fully appreciate the expense
growth that is directly tied to revenue growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then separately, on the NIM side, I know you mentioned that the NIM should be relatively flat going
into the fiscal second quarter. But I was wondering if you could speak to the outlook more for the full year. Is there
a little more room to bring down costs from the deposit side with betas at around 50%, is there still more room,
maybe as you go into the second half of next quarter or even into the fiscal third quarter, is there room to bring
deposit costs down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think NIM staying stable in the second quarter reflects a cut that we're making this week of about 5 basis points.
Assuming rates stay stable, I do not believe that there is much more room to take deposit costs down from our
current average cost after this 5-basis-point cut. And the only other item I would mention on NIM is, if we do
accelerate the growth of our securities portfolio at the bank, which is on the table, that would, all else being equal,
bring down the bank's NIM as we're taking the cash off balance sheet at what's earning today 1.64%. Bringing it
on balance sheet would get a pickup for the firm overall, but that would be – create pressure for the bank's overall
NIM because the securities portfolio which doesn't have credit risk would have a lower yield than the credit
portfolio.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's one thing that as we move assets – if we grow the bank's balance sheet, it's better off with a
consolidated firm but it will show lower NIM because it's higher interest spread than we would earn off balance
sheet but it's – the NIM and the bank would be impacted, so.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
So, I guess, first question here just to follow up on the organic growth, question on PCG. So, clearly you guys
were making a lot of investments to ramp the infrastructure in recent years and I think that's driving or helping to
support the industry leading organic growth. But I just wanted to dig in a little more on kind of the commentary
being kind of in the late stages of this infrastructure expansion and I get that also adds some expense
implications. So really the question is, have you guys been at all capacity constrained on how fast you can recruit,
just not having the full infrastructure in place and as you kind of ramp the infrastructure, is that going to allow you
potentially to close more advisors faster. So potentially there's a scenario where organic growth could accelerate.
And so that's kind of one piece, and then I'm also trying to get a little flavor from a geographic perspective where
you're seeing the most momentum and just an update on kind of the Northeast and West and how you feel about
market shares there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, on the first question, I think that how fast we ramp advisors has to do with, first, can we find quality advisors
that want to come and that we accept. We have people that we don't accept too. So, pipeline is one issue.
Secondly is we're still below the market. Competition increased significantly last year, but we were able to match,
still the same recruiting results without increasing our transition assistance like many of our competitors have. So,
the question really for us is how fast can we grow and assimilate advisors without hurting the service levels of
existing advisors because I think what really is driving our numbers is retention. So that's focus number one.
Most of the investment hasn't been on what I call pure recruiting. I think we do have the platform. If it went up and
we could find more advisors, we could onboard them. A lot of the investment has been on the supervision and
compliance side. And that was in reference to both just our growing to be a larger firm. Certainly, our AML issue a
few years ago, if you remember, we decided that we are going to ramp up all of our systems both AML
compliance and supervision, invested heavily in Mantas and Actimize and other systems which are very
expensive. But we have Mantas fully up and running and Actimize almost there. And a large head count growth
and supervision and compliance. So that will help us ramp people. That part of the infrastructure is very scalable.
And I don't think we'll have to increase it – or it will increase much lower than we can ramp and support advisors.
So that part has been the biggest build really starting a couple of years ago. And maybe in a way we invested
some of the interest rate spreads to build till our infrastructure only had that opportunity. So we're in good shape
there. So I think you'll see it more in the non-comp.
And I think the transition assistance, we don't see going down. We're already amongst – probably the lowest in
the industry, the competitors, in what we pay, competitive but it is lower. And the ACAT is an industry expense
that when people came over, we pay for the accounts to move. That's industry kind of standard and those kind of
fees won't go away purely for recruiting. But again, we believe those have good ROEs and exceptional long term
– mid- to long-term benefits for the business.

Geography?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And geography, we continue to increase, I think – certainly the Northeast, we're seeing a much more activity
given our investments there. In the West, that is growing. I mean, we're growing, I would say, but our percent
share is still very low. So what I like is that our flags are being expanded. I think we've done better in the
Northeast than the West, but we're growing, percentage wise, the highest in those markets but again we have – if
we could get our market share in the rest of the country in the West and Northeast, we have a lot of growth for a
lot of years. If we can just achieve that over the next three to five years, we've got plenty of recruiting
opportunities. So we're making progress.
Recruiting is interesting because it's a long process. Very rarely do you get someone who's just going to leave, if
they do, leave quickly. Sometimes, there's an issue, so you're cautious. And we have recruits that we say, well, I
was here in 2009 and I should have come then and they join us, and some have been here for two years before
they make the move. So, it takes a while to build the momentum and pipeline, and I think we're doing a good job
in both of those markets. Making progress, and I still think we have acceleration opportunity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for all the color. And just a quick follow-up. So, on the comp ratio and margin targets that you put
out there, I understand that your business mix is going to be a big input and it was this quarter as well. Do – those
targets and comp ratio and just kind of overall margin in the outlook, does that assume any additional Fed cuts or
equity market appreciation from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No. I think it's kind of a static analysis of today's interest rate environments in this market. This is what we would
expect. The only way to really impact that is to substantially change our mix or change our payouts. And I think
we like the mix, and it'll come and go depending on the quarter and payouts. We always do those sparingly, but
when we need to do them we do them as you know. So, as we look through BI and other things, we'll look at that
as we always do.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, Paul, welcome to your first official call as CFO. Appreciate the detailed update on expenses and capital. I was
really hoping you could speak to maybe now you're in the new seat, what some of your priorities are, and
specifically, wanted to unpack your comments in just a couple of areas. The appetite to maybe reduce gearing to
the short end of the curve and how you might look to grow the securities book which I think you alluded to; capital
return appetite, if your stock is trading a little bit above that 1.8 times book value thresholds; and maybe just some
enhanced disclosure on organic growth. So securities book, capital return and organic growth disclosure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
That's a dense question there, Steven, but thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
It is. I'm still going to take my follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. In terms of the securities portfolio, I mean we have actually grown it substantially over the last few years
here and we're just looking at the amount of cash we have off balance sheet, what the forward curve is telling us
and the amount of capital we have to – and the capacity to grow assets on our balance sheet. And it's something
that we're considering doing. It'll be modest maybe $3 billion to $5 billion sort of over a period of time in terms of
accelerating the growth of incremental securities.
And again, we're not looking to take credit risk in that portfolio. This would be mostly agency mortgage-backed
securities with duration of three to four years. And with that, you would get somewhere around today – it changes
every day, but today around 30 basis points of incremental pickup over what we earn off balance sheet.
In terms of repurchases, I mean we're going to stay consistent with what we've been doing for a very long time.
We're going to – we said we're going to offset dilution. And then as we've shown last year, we're – we have plenty
of capital, liquidity and authorization to increase our repurchases if the price drops to what we consider
opportunistic levels and that's something that we're going to remain committed to doing as well. And then
obviously, the other priority is expenses which we've discussed in pretty good detail already.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
And just the enhanced disclosure on the organic growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, we are working – I think it's referring specifically to the net new asset metric, that is something we are
working on. I think over the last two or three quarters the number of inbound requests for that has subsided
somewhat because when you look at the 31% year-over-year growth in assets in fee-based accounts, I think
everyone has acknowledged that, that's among the highest, if not the highest in the industry. So I think we're
getting credit for their organic growth. But at the same time, we appreciate the sort of desire to have it – easier
sort of metric to track in that regard. So it's something we are looking at. But kind of tying back to your first
question on expense growth, nothing is free. And so, we're doing it in the context of our other IT priorities that we
have across the firm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think one of the challenges right now too for the industry is that our focus is Reg BI, it's effective June 30. So, as
we look at IT and ops time, it's all focused to being making sure right now that we're compliant and have our
systems up. There are process and disclosure and other document changes that are required. So any excess
capacity – or it's really first priority, but any excess capacity we've had to do these other things have been focused
on BI till we get them done. To do them effectively, we have to start rolling things out. We've started to roll things
out already, because we have to have them up and running and in place and done by June 30, not start doing
them on June 30, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
And just one follow-up for me on expenses. You guys cited some progress in slowing the pace of core non-
comps. That's certainly evident, but the elevated comp pressure is continuing to weigh disproportionately on the
margin. As we look ahead with NIM stabilizing in 2Q, revenue growth coming from more compensable activities
within PCG. I'm just trying to think about longer term, how should we view that incremental margin as those
dollars come on and most of the growth comes from fee-generating activities. Just trying to think about the
earnings growth algorithm beyond 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, I think given the current rate environment and market environment, which obviously are the two big
factors that would impact your margin as – along with revenue mix. But I think 67.5% as of right now as best as
we can tell. 67.5% for the comp ratio and 17% for the pre-tax margin is the best visibility we have given our
current revenue mix. So, to the extent that we – the market environment changes, interest rate environment
changes or our revenue mix changes, then we would adjust those targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, this quarter was impacted by lower M&A and tax credit funds, which are, of course – I mean, they're
cyclical. They're never – versus the PCG business. So that impacted us. But the interest rate is the big change.

Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
And that's just math. I mean, I'm kind of amazed that we could lose 10% of our pre-tax and that much revenue
from those three changes and make it up – almost make it up in one quarter.
So – but I don't – again, the only way to really change that is looking at payouts across our system and what we
pay folks for production. That's where it's all going. But at least that expense is good growth. That's production
and profit growth. So, we'll take the growth in that ratio. We can grow the revenues even faster and add to the
margins. So, we want to make sure they're competitive and fair. And as things shift and change over time, we will
look at that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. Thanks for the enhanced disclosure. Just sort
of coming back to margin discussion a little bit more. As you look at the segment level for Private Client, I'm sort
of wondering what's your long-term outlook beyond fiscal 2020 and sort of where that margin might be get to and
what are the drivers there? And then related to that, that 75% payout that you mentioned earlier in your prepared
comments, how is that relative to market levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would tell you in terms of the Private Client Group margin, a lot of it really depends on geography. So, to
the extent that we have movement to fee-based accounts continue which we've had obviously, a lot of the benefit
gets reflected in our Asset Management segment to the extent that we sweep more cash to Raymond James
Bank which we're considering doing even more so with the growth in the securities portfolio, that would increase
the margin at Raymond James Bank relative to Private Client Group.
So, really, we kind of look at the margins on a consolidated basis. We think that's the most meaningful especially
when comparing across firms because a lot of firms have their bank and their asset management fee-based
platform in their wealth management segment. So we expect it – again, on a consolidated basis, our best guess
right now is 17% or better for the pre-tax margin.
And then the payout, the payout is just a function of the mix between our employee channel and on the
independent contractor channel where the independent contractors are paid in the 80% range. And so, when you
blend the two is where you get the 75% type payout on the production, not the overall revenues to the firm, but
the revenues that are compensable to the advisors on average generate.

William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. And just my follow-up, you sort of mentioned that a corporate development has been of
a priority but pricing is a little heavy. So sort of wondering where you could – maybe you could sort of help at least
from a backdrop or a color perspective of where you're most focused, whether it be in sort of bolstering the
Private Client side or other segments of the business. And then, conversely, as you look at your business and
think about the mix a year or two years from now, are there any businesses that you're in today that you could
maybe deemphasize a little bit to overall bolster ROE?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
If you look at where most of our ROE is generated or capital is deployed, it's first in the bank, which is our biggest
capital deployer, and we like where that is and then Private Client Group where it's really transition assistance,
and investment in that business including technology. So we kind of like the businesses we're in and the mix.
We're honestly open – Private Client Group is our anchor business, so we always look to that first, but we're
actually open to things that will grow any of our segments. We like the businesses. We think they're performing
relatively well now to the market. And if there's opportunity, because we're not capital bound right now, we would
do something that, first, has economic sense to shareholders, but it has to first make the business better, not just
bigger. We avoid things just to be bigger but don't really have good ROE to the shareholders.
So we're focused on all four. We continue to be in dialogue. But I would say, over the last year, we've had more
dialogues that ended without anyone trading because we just felt the market was too – the ask was too high and I
think the market agreed on a lot of those assets, sort of the ask was just too high. So, we're not going to do
something just to do something

open. Please go ahead.

Hey, good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Maybe we could just follow up on the comp in PCG a little bit. If I look at – whether year-over-year or sequentially,
if I look at total comp not just sort of the compensation for the advisors, but look at total comp relative to
compensable revenues sequentially and year-over-year, total comps growing faster than revenue. And so you're
getting negative leverage or negative incremental margins out of the total comp line. And can you just kind of help
us understand what's driving total comp? Is that the other comp? Is that just the recruiting that's maybe at some
point going to slow because I would think at some point you need to get positive incremental margins off revenue
even if it's not just the FA advisors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The biggest driver of that, as I talked about earlier, is the buildup of support, both AML compliance and
supervision, all three of those functions. We've made, starting three years ago almost, significant investments,
really accelerated that growth over the last couple of years but now it's decelerating. So, that's the leverage we
think we'll get out. So, maybe in some areas, we have to play a little catch-up, but we've really build it for the
future and I think that's where our non-comp leverage is going to come from. So, that's an awful lot of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think the other thing you have to do going back to our whole dialogue around compensable versus non-
compensable revenues, on a year-over-year basis, Private Client Group is showing 4% growth in total revenues,
but it's really 6% growth in compensable revenues. And the compensable revenues is the production, the number
of advisors, the number of accounts, et cetera. And that's really what's going to drive both the payout and the
support and infrastructure needs. So, the 6% still is lower than the 8% and the 8% being the administrative non-
FA comp in the Private Client Group business. The reason it's higher is for the reasons that Paul mentioned. But if
you kind of look back three years to support the fact that we're sort of in the later stages of this infrastructure
buildout, three years ago that line grew 17%; in fiscal 2018 the admin comp and PCG grew 17%; the last year it
grew 12%, year-over-year – for the quarter, it grew 8% and that's sort of what we're budgeting for the year. So, it's
come down substantially as we've – in the later stages of this buildout in Private Client Group business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
And so that should continue to sort of further slow and not be so tied to revenue?

Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. And then – and maybe just a follow-up. And just talking more about the balance sheet – potential balance
sheet growth, would that be sort of slow, more impactful in 2021 if you decide to do that, or if you do decide to go
ahead with it, how quickly could you put assets on the balance sheet?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We can grow the securities portfolio, $2 billion, $3 billion pretty rapidly, Jim. So, if it's something that we decide to
move forward with, which is something that we're still having to discuss internally, I would expect the first couple
billion if we do decide to move forward with it to occur pretty quickly. But again, we're still in discussions on that.

Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you for joining us. And again, we normally like to do this on an Investor & Analyst
Day, but again holding off last year, we said, we wanted to wait to see what happened, how many rate cuts or – to
provide you the data – you can see why now because had there been one more cut or one less cut, it would have
significantly impacted our comp ratios, our earnings, our mix. So wish we could have gotten to you a little bit
sooner, but we got it to you as fast as we could. And thank you for joining us this morning.
