Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Philip B. Flynn
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Niles, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. Associated had an unusual but successful second
quarter.
I'm proud of how my thousands of colleagues have responded to the challenges. We focused on protecting the
health of our customers and colleagues while meeting the needs of our customers. We met those needs with PPP
loans, payment deferrals, fee waivers and the distribution of stimulus funds. We ensured our ability to meet the
future needs of our communities and customers with a significant increase in our capital through the sale of
Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting and a preferred stock issuance.
We've seen record inflows of deposits and have abundant liquidity. With the revenue challenge brought on by
near zero interest rates, we managed our expenses down. While no one could predict the ultimate impact of the
COVID pandemic on credit, we saw some encouraging early signs from our borrowers.
So let's look at our financial results. Turning to slide 2, our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share,
including the $163 million gain on sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting. Average loans grew
considerably during the quarter, largely driven by PPP loans and commercial line draws. Loan funding along with
government stimulus programs and overall increased savings rates led to higher deposit balances as well.
Our loan to deposit ratio was 94% at the end of the quarter, 90% without PPP and 61% of our total deposits were
made up of low cost deposits. While we haven't seen significant changes in credit metrics yet, our reserve for loan
losses increased $35 million during the second quarter, and as of June 30, our allowance for loan ratio was
1.73% or 1.8% excluding PPP loans. The sale of ABRC and the issuance of $100 million of preferred stock listed
our capital ratios, CET1 increased 89 basis points from the first quarter to 10% at a quarter. Our tangible book
value per share also increased, moving up 11% from last quarter to $16.21.
Average loan balance trends are shown on slide 3. Commercial and business lending grew nearly $1.7 billion,
driven predominantly by PPP loans and active mortgage warehouse market and increased draws on general
commercial lines of credit. While we saw unusually high commercial line draws at the end of the first quarter, as
the second quarter progressed, these lines paid down. Growth in CRE was primarily driven by new loans plus
continued funding of construction loans. On average, residential mortgages declined during the second quarter as
we continued to sell new production and some portfolio loans to the agencies.
Turning to slide 4, which show end of period loan trends, which will highlight second quarter activity, we ended the
second quarter with $24.8 billion of loans, a net increase of $467 million from the first quarter. Included in these
balances was over $1 billion of outstanding PPP loans. This was partially offset by $559 million of paydowns on
general commercial lines during the quarter. We view the repayment of these lines as a sign our customers have
a more optimistic outlook regarding their liquidity than they did at the end of the first quarter.
As previously mentioned, our commercial real estate portfolios continued to grow during the quarter. At quarter
end, we still had nearly $2 billion of unfunded commitments, which we expect will continue to fund up over the
balance of 2020 and into 2021. We expect to continue to grow our commercial real estate balances over the
course of the year.
Turning to slide 5, let's look at our portfolio composition at the end of the second quarter. In the second column,
we identified our key COVID loan exposures, which I'll highlight on the next page. We've also broken out our
3

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
deferred loans and our non-accrual loans, which remain minimal. As the pandemic's impact on the economy
expanded during the second quarter, we responded to our customers' needs by underwriting PPP loans and by
deferring and modifying certain loans as shown on slide 5. Approximately 35% of key COVID commercial loan
exposures have received a modification or deferral, 19% received a PPP loan and 4% received both.
Now let's look at our key COVID commercial loan exposures on slide 6. This is an update of the slide we
introduced in the first quarter. We continue to monitor risks in the loan portfolio. The table on slide 6 details our
exposures to several categories of commercial loans potentially impacted by COVID-19 and lower hydrocarbon
prices. The $2.2 billion represents less than 9% of outstanding loans at the end of the second quarter.
Making up 5% of our loan book, retailers and retail commercial real estate remain our largest area of exposure.
$664 million of these loans are to retail, real estate, of which the majority is collateralized by malls, shopping
centers and non-grocery store anchored strip centers. These loans had an average loan-to-value ratio of
approximately 57% at origination, providing a significant cushion for potential deterioration.
We would highlight amongst our retail-oriented REITs, which are predominantly investment grade credits,
balances paid down about $54 million from last quarter to about $400 million. Oil and gas loans also declined $35
million from last quarter and account for 1.7% of our loan balances. In the second quarter, we grew reserves
further on this portfolio. Despite the price of oil creeping back up from the first quarter, we still remain concerned
about the outlook for this industry. Outside retail and oil and gas, our [indiscernible] (08:11) exposure is limited.
Hotels and restaurants are our next largest portfolios and each of these categories represent less than 1% of total
loans. Overall, we believe our exposure to COVID-affected industries remains manageable. We're seeing positive
dynamics and our exposures remain relatively unchanged quarter over quarter.
Now let me comment on our COVID-relief efforts for our commercial customers highlighted on slide 7. At June 30,
we had just over $820 million of completed commercial loan deferrals. The loan deferrals included $638 million of
commercial real estate, primarily comprising the hotel, retail borrowers, representing about 11% of the
commercial real estate loan book. Commercial and business lending had $184 million of deferrals or about 2% of
that book. New commercial loan deferral requests slowed as the quarter progressed and many customers with
deferrals ending in June have not asked for additional assistance.
Our consumer-related COVID-relief efforts are highlighted on slide 8. We finished the second quarter with $725
million of consumer loan deferrals or 8% of the total residential and consumer loan book. New deferral requests
have slowed substantially since the peak in May and have essentially ceased since the latter half of June. We
also supported many of our customers with waived or refunded fees during the pandemic. Since implementing our
COVID-19 relief program, we've refunded or waived nearly $2 million in fees for consumers and small businesses
through June 30.
Turning to slide 9, early signs are positive as many customers who received payment deferrals are returning to
normal payment structures. Despite having been granted payment waivers, about 27% of consumers with
completed loan deferrals have made at least one subsequent payment. In corporate banking and small business,
$46 million of loan deferrals ended during June, and of those over 90% of customers are expected to resume
making payments.
Based on early discussions, we expect nearly all of the remaining customers with deferrals in corporate banking
and small business to return to making payments. Commercial real estate had $116 million in loan deferrals
expire during June, about half of those customers are expected to start making payments again. The other half
consisting either of hotels or retail properties have requested further extensions. Of the additional loans on
4

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
deferral, we expect about one-third of these customers to require some form of assistance with the majority being
in the hotel sector.
Turning to slide 10, you can see we have built reserves by about $35 million during the second quarter. This
brings our total allowance to $429 million at the end of June. Our reserve covers 1.7% of total loans or 1.8%
excluding PPP loans. We've modeled our reserves against the June Moody's baseline with our own qualitative
overlays. Additional reserves were set aside for certain industries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reserves
on COVID-affected loans covered 6.2% of loan balances compared to about 1.4% for non-COVID-affected loans.
As you can see the bulk of our reserve build is attributed to commercial real estate and oil and gas. During the
quarter, we built up our CRE reserves by $27 million, reflecting the increased risk profile we see in our retail and
hotel portfolios. Additional reserves were also built up on oil and gas loans, which increased by $6 million and
now cover 19.4% of the portfolio.
Turning to slide 11, you can see our credit metrics have drifted up slightly but remain fairly stable. Potential
problem loans increased $73 million, driven by general C&I and commercial real estate within the key COVID
commercial loan exposures portfolio. Non-accrual loans increased $35 million, but are only slightly elevated over
the second quarter of 2019. $21 million of the increase came from oil and gas, with most of the rest coming from
commercial real estate. Our net charge-offs continue to be almost exclusively in the oil and gas space. Our oil and
gas reserve increased 273 basis points from last quarter. The loans in this portfolio are all shared with other
banks and our high level of reserves reflects a conservative view of the ultimate outcome for some of these
credits as we wind down the business.
Turning to slide 12, average deposits were up nearly $1.9 billion or 8% over the first quarter. Most of this growth
came from low-cost, non-interest-bearing checking accounts and savings accounts. Deposits remain elevated due
to PPP loans staying in accounts, government stimulus money and generally higher savings rates amongst
consumers. Our low-cost deposit mix continues to improve as these balances made up 61% of overall deposits at
the end of the second quarter.
Turning to slide 13, second quarter net interest income was $190 million and year-to-date margin came in at
2.66%. Pressure on the margin has been driven by asset yield compression relative to our ability to reduce liability
cost as a result of Fed cutting rates to near zero. Total cost of interest-bearing deposits dropped to 25 basis
points in June as we reduced pricing across the board. While second quarter NIM declined 35 basis points from
the first quarter, we expect NIM to stabilize in Q3 and recover somewhat in Q4. Total interest-bearing liabilities fell
to 57 basis points in June, driven by the remix of our deposit base and interest rate reductions.
Turning to slide 14, second quarter non-interest income came in at $254 million. The mortgage business remains
active resulting in an increase of $6 million from the first quarter. Gross mortgage banking income was $20
million, offset by $8 million of MSR impairment resulting in $12 million of net mortgage banking income. We saw a
decline in service charges and deposit account fees during the second quarter of about $4 million, driven by less
customer and economic activity during Q2. We expect activity to recover as we go through the year.
The gain on sales assets was $157 million during the quarter. We've further broken that down on the next slide.
We closed the sale of ABRC on June 30. The sale resulted in $266 million of proceeds and a GAAP gain of $163
million after personnel and transaction costs were accounted for. The net after tax gain was $104 million and
second quarter earnings per share excluding the gain was $0.26. Separately, we recognized about $6 million in
losses on non-ABRC-related write downs. The bulk of this was driven by the write-down from an equity interest in
a company related to a restructured oil and gas loan.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 16, we look at our customer activity. Branch activity has slowly started to come back since April.
However, customers have moved away from using the lobby and continue to use the drive-throughs. Prior to
COVID, about 65% of transactions took place in the lobby, but this has shifted to only 30% as of late. Customers
are also resuming normal spending levels as debit and credit card spend increased 23% from April to June.
During the COVID outbreak, we've seen a strong shift to mobile banking. Even with branch lobbies reopening,
active mobile application users have increased 15% from January to June. This is a positive trend, which we feel
will provide efficiency opportunities in the long run.
On slide 17, you can see our continuing downward trend of expenses. Total non-interest expense was $183
million, down $9 million from the first quarter. The decrease in expense was spread across several categories.
Personnel expense was down $3 million due to lower benefits, fringe and equity plan expenses partially offset by
higher commissions. Occupancy was down $2 million since we were plowing snow. Business development and
advertising were down $2 million as we had less business travel and marketing activity during the quarter.
As shown on slide 18, our regulatory capital levels remain strong. The sale of ABRC added 41 basis points to our
CET1 ratio and 27 basis points to our TCE ratio. Overall, CET1 increased to 10.25% from 9.36% in the first
quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio also increased to 7.25%, up from 6.9% in Q1. As I mentioned, tangible
book value per share is now $16.21, up 11% from the first quarter. We expect capital to continue to build through
the remainder of 2020.
Finally on slide 19, we discuss our outlook, which includes several updated items. We expect our margin to
stabilize in Q3 and to improve in Q4 as we see PPP loans pay down. For the full year, we expect our margin to
come in between 2.55% and 2.6%. This assumes the pay down of our PPP loans in Q4 in early 2021. Mortgage
banking will continue to be elevated in Q3, and service charges will start to return to normal levels as COVID-
related fee waivers have expired and consumer activity continues to pick up.
Our quarterly expense run rate is expected to be about $175 million, due to $15 million in quarterly expense
reductions from the sale of ABRC. With an outlook for low rates stretching through next year, we're currently
taking a look at our expense base beyond our current guidance, and we'll have more to discuss later this quarter.
Based on our expected view of economic activity within our footprint, we anticipate loan loss provisions over the
second half of the year to be less than they were in the first half.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a big picture question, first Phil, you talked about encouraging early trends. And then I think another
comment is a positive dynamics. Are you just referring to some of the branch count and consumer-type activity
that you highlighted, or are you talking about something else some more activity and optimism with your
commercial book and commercial real estate book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, it's several things, Jon. So, certainly the fact that debit and credit card usage has trended up pretty
dramatically here over the last month or so is encouraging, but in particular, as we look at the 90-day deferrals
that we gave at the start of all this, which were starting to expire in June and will continue to expire this month and
next month, most of those borrowers who got deferrals are going back to making payments, which is very
encouraging.
Now we're still waiting on the consumers, who we gave six-month deferrals too, but more than a quarter are down
even though they had deferrals have been making payments. So, as we launched into this unusual situation of
granting deferrals and waivers, we didn't really know what to expect as we got to the back end of that and we're
certainly gratified that these customers are able to resume their normal payments.

Philip B. Flynn A

Fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
It feels like with your reserve levels, some of the charges you've taken, got to be close to the end of the pane on
this in terms of at least impacting the quarterly provision and the quarterly run rate. What would need to change
worse – to make it worse in your mind?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's a good question. If you look at the level of reserves we have in addition to the charge [indiscernible]
(21:52) the book that remains, we've got this portfolio marked at about $0.66 on the dollar roughly. It's been
interesting this last week as other banks have reported that there's a real divergence of views on what's going to
happen here. We had one peer bank make the decision to sell the large bulk of their energy portfolio and their
reserve secured loans at a very significant discount, but not out of sight of where we have our bookmarked.
And we had another peer bank which has much, much lower reserves against a much larger book, expressing a
lot of optimism as we go through the summer into the fall redetermination period. So, there's really a wide
spectrum of views on how all of this is going to turn out amongst banks. And we think it's been prudent as we've
been marking this book down, taking charges, reserving substantially against that we should be very well
positioned to your point to get through this without a hell of a lot more pain. It's been bad enough as it is, but I
think we're in a pretty decent spot with the mark that we have today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one last one, I'll take a shot at it. But Q3 provision, I know it's hard to project it. But what
would be kind of the key drivers to your model assuming the economy is relatively stable in terms of driving the
need for more, call it, economic factor reserve building?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So you've heard us express that. Based on our assumptions, we think that back half of the year
provisioning will be less than the first half and that's based upon economic activity continuing as it is today and not
having to experience widespread shutdown of economies in our footprint. So absent that, we feel pretty
comfortable with the guidance that we provided.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on the margin, you noted – so stability which
is definitely good and then the expectation for some recovery in the fourth quarter, and gathering that that's based
on the expectation for forgiveness of the PPP loans or at least that portion of them and the accelerated fee that
you got there, how much of the notion of recovery in the margin in the fourth quarter is indeed based on that and
what would happen to the margin ex any acceleration of PPP fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, as we mentioned on slide 19, we do expect PPP to pay down mostly in Q4 and then into early 2020.
And on page 4 of the press release tables, we show you the remaining unamortized PPP fee balance. So you can
track it with us, but, yeah, we're saying mostly in Q4, so it's just half or more and then the balance over the 2021.
So, you can sort of back into the rough number. I would note our guidance, I think when we've spoken probably
back in May, we thought it would stay above $260 million, but obviously since then the PPP program has been
basically extended out, right, so instead of beginning to realize some of that in the Q3 period and then the rest of
it in Q4 and less in 2021, we've had to push that out, which is why our margin has trended a little lower from our
guidance perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. And I guess what I'm getting at is just sort of the steady state margin, do you think it's – I know we
think it's stable in the third quarter but presumably outside of PPP would that continue, in other words, we kind of
reached a bottom for the margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, I want to say that the bottom is going to be hit in Q3, right, so on a month-to-month basis, June was a little
worse than May and it probably trends a little lower in July and then it starts to bounce up, right. So that it will find
its absolute floor in Q3, probably not too far below where we are but pretty close, but it's going to stabilize and
then we expect it to bounce up as we move through the balance of the year. And the two factors there are that in
Q4 the PPP pick up, but also we're seeing spreads beginning to widen, right. So, we will find our floor probably
here in July and it'll start moving back higher as we move through the rest of the year on spread widening and the
PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And we've got CDs which we will continue to roll off and grind lower, so there'll be some structural reduction of our
liability costs just as longer dated deposits mature and get re-priced.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And as we know – I think we showed you the average yield for the deposits was 28 basis points and if you look at
the slides, you'll see the number for June was 25 basis points, so that the overall interest-bearing deposit cost,
CDs and money market and checking continues to grind lower as well, which is why, again, we'll hit bottom here
in July, [ph] it feels like (27:36), and then start moving higher from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
So even without PPP, we'd be trending about where we're hitting now and maybe a little bit up as liabilities re-
price.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Yeah. That's what I was getting at. So I appreciate that color. And then final one just on the
mortgage expectation, where you note your expectations for elevated mortgage revenues, are you guys thinking
about that on the basis of the $12 million reported mortgage line, or are you sort of thinking about it ex the MSR,
so like up of a base closer to $20 million?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So we've got as we sit here right now still have a $1.6 billion pipeline of mortgages to work through. So,
that's the highest it's been in two years as we sit here today. Forecasting MSR impairment is always difficult
because you got to pick a rate on a day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
But one would hope we wouldn't see an impairment like we saw at the end of the second quarter. So, we would
be working off of more the $20 million number than the $12 million number hopefully.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good afternoon, guys.

Afternoon, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just want to follow up, Phil, in your response to Jon around this customer activity. Talk to us in terms of what it
looks like in the markets, we've clearly seen an uptick in cases, lockdowns in certain parts of the country. Just
when you think about your customers, your footprint, how do things look today relative to April, May? And have
you seen kind of a negative move in the last few weeks, or are you seeing a steady return to normalcy? Just any
color would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, rightly or wrongly, Wisconsin continues to have activity even though our COVID infection rates are as
high or higher than they've been just because of as you recall the Supreme Court threw out the government's
ability to control much. So, economic activity in Wisconsin continues, and as you know reasonably robust and
then Minnesota is somewhere in between here and Illinois because Chicago is still relatively locked down. So
we've got kind of a wide spectrum there. But our forecast is that things will continue as they are across the
footprint. And perhaps a little more activity down in Chicago will lend itself to the assumptions that we made when
we said provisioning is going to be less in the back half, correct, Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Ebrahim, I might just add if you look at the June unemployment rate data, if you look at sort of the coast, you'll find
unfortunately places in the teens. But if you look at Wisconsin and Minnesota, you're looking at eight handle
unemployment. So, there is a pretty strong difference between the activity levels on the coast versus the upper
Midwest.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, [ph] as I said (31:22), Minnesota and Wisconsin are the core of our market in exposure and activity and
customer basis of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. Understood. And I guess just moving to slide 16 and maybe this is a little bit a few quarters out, but I
think you're very thoughtful in terms of how you've brought down expenses coming out of the last crisis, as you
now think about just the change in customer behavior, the digital adoption, how are you thinking about what this
means for further rationalizing the branch footprint, the efficiency opportunities down the road?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, as I mentioned, we are taking a look at the expense space and applying some of the learnings that
we've had from this, particularly this work-from-home environment. So we've got a number of initiatives underway
internally to figure out what work looks like for us as we go through the rest of the COVID period and thereafter.
We're still operating from home. We don't have people in our corporate offices and then Chris, Brian and I are
sitting here, and there's probably 20 people when there's normally 500 people in here.
So we – and we don't have any big plans to bring a bunch of people back. And the fact of the matter is the
company is operating just fine. We're processing a massive mortgage refi boom and all of that is going into our
thinking about how we reduce our expense run rate going forward beyond what we've just guided. So we'll have
more information as we get into the quarter as we continue to work on this. There's also, obviously, opportunities
to think about how we're serving customers. The mobile pickup, the online pickup, the fact that even now that
we've opened our branches, people now are much more likely to go through the [indiscernible] (33:18) come into
the lobby, presents a lot of different opportunities to think about how the model works going forward and we're
thinking through all that right now, Ebrahim.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Afternoon, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
The CET capital up to 10.25% following the sale and you said earlier capital should grow in the second half of this
year. My question is do you have a targeted capital level? You used to talk about that in the past and the reason I
ask is that if we look at into 2021, is it appropriate to think about buyback activities kind of think about putting
them into our models if we're assuming a return to more normal credit trends?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's a little bit early to forecast that right now. More capital is better given the uncertainties there out there.
We've said that we're not going to buy back shares the balance of the year, as we get toward year end and we
see what credit looks like and we see where our capital ratios sit, we'll obviously take a look at that, but certainly
as we sit today having significantly more capital, having a larger tangible book value and being awash in liquidity
are good things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then as a follow-up question, in the first quarter the reserve build was mostly C&I and then as I look at
the second quarter it was mostly CRE. So when you think about the back half of this year and the prospects of
incremental building, do you think it'll be heavily weighted towards one or the other or more of an even split?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
My guess is that I don't know exactly how far it's going to build, to tell you the truth, because I think as we get
toward the back half of the year, I would think some of the oil and gas stuff will resolve itself one way or the other
although we're well reserved against that. So when one thinks that we'll have a lot of provisioning to do, but if I
had to guess, I don't think outside of oil and gas we have a lot of stress in the commercial space, so if we're going
to build I'm guessing it'll be the retail-oriented commercial real estate, whether it's retailers directly or retail tenants
in properties. That's probably where we would see it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question. Chris, maybe go back to the interest income for a second, want to ask the margin
question a little bit different, if we fast forward six months and PPP is behind us, how do we think about stability
and ultimate growth in core net interest income given outlook for growth a little bit more on the deposit re-pricing
and [ph] the full effect of loan yields (36:32)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, again, I would say on the – there's a couple of things, right. So on the loan side, we have a margin on
most commercial credits as you can see from the tables that is approaching effectively the margin floor. So,
effectively, when we hit in Q3 here, LIBOR is at zero, so basically [ph] where earning is the "quoted spread"
(36:57) to the customer is the fact that we hit the floor. So that's going to hit that floor and the good news is from
our contractual structure, we've got LIBOR zero floors in there, so it's not going to go lower and so on the loan
side, we're kind of hitting the floor in July. And as we roll over renew and add new, we're getting a little bit more
spread with each of those actions, so we assume the spreads will widen a little bit as we move forward.
As Phil pointed out, you've got a back book of CDs that going to roll and continue to roll down. So as we look at
our total deposit book, again our cost is 28 basis points for the quarter, but the CD book was at 144 basis points.
Well, that's generally one year and in. If you look at our maturity detail that we disclosed in our call reports, you'll
see that. So, essentially that's going to roll off and come down towards that 25 basis points. So that's a real dollar
savings that will just come in over the next 12 months and a lot of that in the next 6 months. So you're going to
see a [ph] role (37:57) that's going to be beneficial and we'll continue to work on other liability levers and that sort
of on the core just loan and deposit side. And then the PPP, we think again will be a positive that pops in Q4 now
and then into Q1. So all of that together says we should see core improving as we move through the year plus
PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And then to answer your question on NII, Chris, we've got a significant backlog of CRE which will be funded up
through this period of time well into next year. That's going to help. We've got a residential mortgage boom and
we can choose whether we're going to sell some of that on to the agencies or perhaps portfolio, some of that
we're thinking through that at the moment. So we could get some growth there on NII.
Of course, it's a little harder to forecast right now. There's just not a lot of new activity going on. People aren't out
looking to change their banks. But assuming the economy continues along this path and slowly improves, we
would expect to start to see commercial loan growth too as we get farther into the year and into next year. So, I
think with the cost of funds continuing to grind down, funding up on CRE, perhaps resi mortgage and then
14

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
hopefully on commercial, we should start to see some consistent growth in NII as we get later into the year and
then into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. If I could just ask one more on the deferral program, can you speak to [ph]
what you (39:35) might do different in round two, if there are round twos in terms of re-underwriting of the
borrower that need a little bit more help? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So it's going to be very dependent upon the borrower circumstances. So, for example, in the hotel space,
which is very small for us and we've got a couple of customers who have substantial outside resources. And so
we're hopeful there that we'll be able to stretch out some of those loans and get through this period of time until
they get their occupancy back up. The retailer stuff is highly dependent upon how people come back to retail
stores. But early indications, again, are pretty good since people are generally getting through their deferral period
and starting to pay. And again a lot of our loans, bulk of our loans have substantial guarantors behind them as
well.
So, the initial push with the pandemic was if someone needs a deferral, we'll give it to them. But as we come up to
that initial 90 days rolling off in June and going forward, these are turning into – let's have a serious discussion
about what it looks like and where we've been [indiscernible] (41:05) surprise, but would be pleased with the
response that we've been getting. That's why we have a general sense of optimism at this point about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And Chris, could you just repeat the fees, like, I was looking quickly through the deck, I didn't
see it, the remaining PPP fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's in the press release table. Sorry, Chris, I wasn't clear. It's on page 4 and it's in the middle of the page
and it says Payment Protection Program fees net and that was $24 million at the end of June, that have not yet
been amortized in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to maybe just follow up on the commercial construction book. It looks
like there's about a 4.5% reserve there. Is that just an abundance of caution, or should we read that to mean that
what's in that construction book is maybe more in a higher risk segment, maybe retail or hotel, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Look, I think our CECL methodology borrowed heavily from our experiences in the last downturn and over time.
So, construction loans have during downturns [ph] when where (42:31) people have taken larger hits in the past,
and our CECL methodology necessarily sort of looks at the last couple of recessions and factors therein. So,
that's partly the issue. And I think it was high on day one, as you can see with one of the larger buckets where we
increased our reserves on day one and it continues high because in both Associated Bank's own experience and
the industry's experience that's where when things go – construction projects stop, there's usually pain for all
involved. And if you – the environment shifts on you as people are completing projects, the amount of time they
may sit unutilized or underutilized causes sometimes more challenges than other projects that are already
occupied, that are completed. So, that's just good practice to have a little more reserves in that bucket.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And, Michael, to just give you a little color on what's in there, 62% of loan production this year, which is mostly
funding up this stuff is in either industrial or multifamily, very, very little in the retail space, which of course would
be the riskiest space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the capital commentary, Chris, you made the comment that
you expect capital to continue to build. I guess, I'm just trying to level set that against potential increases in non-
performing assets as we move forward through the crisis. At what point will – do you think the risk weightings on
those will increase and maybe offset some of the capital build that's occurring naturally?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. So, we are assuming that a good portion of the PPP
balances come off, so that's $1 billion. And even there's only half of it that comes off and we're certainly thinking
most of it does by the end of the year, that means our tangible assets are going to come down by more than $0.5
billion of that top, which means the tangible common equity [indiscernible] (44:47) will just naturally drift higher.
In addition, as Phil mentioned, we're looking at lending that likely is looking reasonable to add to volumes before
the end of the year. So, again, there'll probably be a slight positive, but not enough to offset the more than $0.5
billion of PPP that will come off. So, we'll have a net improvement just because the balance sheet effectively
shrinks. That will have less of an impact on the risk-weighted assets because what will be adding will be real
commercial CRE 100% risk-weighted stuff and what's coming off as a zero risk-weighted stuff but we expect to
earn our dividend and more over the course of the back half of the year and so, therefore, we'll have capital
accretion and net balance sheet shrinkage which will contribute to higher capital ratios as we move forward.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. And one last just clarification, just on the effective tax rate for the year, 26% this quarter, so that
gets me to a pretty low tax rate in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure I was thinking about that
correctly.
[indiscernible] (45:47)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. And we guided that we think that – yeah. We've guided. We think it's going to be less than 18%. It's kind of
a quirk of the way you need to account for the sale. So we recognized the sale this quarter. So we have to sort of
fully tax it at the full marginal rate, and because some of the ABRC acquisitions in the past were tax-free
acquisitions, we didn't have tax basis in them the way we have on other deals. So the tax rate on that deal was a
little bit higher than normal, but as we move through the course of the year, you have to average out to the
normalized full year tax rate. And so, it'll just naturally come down over the subsequent quarters and you'll see the
overall we expect to be something less than 18%
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Operator: We do have one final question coming from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please proceed
with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Two quick questions for me. One on the CRE
growth this quarter. I guess where are you seeing the incremental demand for CRE now? And I guess, is that –
are those industries where you're seeing demand today is at kind of where you're expecting growth to come in for
the rest of the year as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So the growth you are seeing is generally construction loans funding up and construction loans that have
completed, stabilized and flipped over into the investor bucket, so this is stuff that was mostly originated a year
ago. There isn't a lot of new origination going on anywhere as you would expect. And the bulk of it is – as I told,
Michael, just a minute ago was – is in the industrial and multifamily space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just as you look at the second round of deferral requests, will you be asking the borrower
for something in exchange for that second round of deferrals, whether it's guarantee or increased collateral or
anything like that?
