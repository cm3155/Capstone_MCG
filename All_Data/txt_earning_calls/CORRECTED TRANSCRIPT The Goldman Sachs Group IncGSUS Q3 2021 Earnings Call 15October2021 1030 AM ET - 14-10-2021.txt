MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
recorded today, October 15, 2021.
Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.

Global Head-Investor Relations, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter
earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor
Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman
Sachs Group and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.
I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; our Chief Financial Officer,
Stephen Scherr; and our incoming CFO, Denis Coleman. With that, let me pass the call to David.

David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. I'm joining you today from California where we have been
hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders + Innovators Summit. We bring together over 100 of the
most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build
successful and enduring companies.
I've heard from a number of them that they're extremely excited to meet with our team and with other
entrepreneurs here in California. In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to
spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with
clients and in the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing.
This quarter, we announced two acquisitions, a key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor
Day in 2020 centered around diversifying our business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings.
There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans, and now we are further
investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. First, in August, we announced the
acquisition of a leading European asset manager, NN Investment Partners. The addition of $320 billion in assets
under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our Asset Management platform, enhance our distribution
network on the continent, and bolster our ESG capabilities.
On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepare to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP26, I would like to
underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris
Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth, and
we're making progress toward our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing, and advisory activity to
help achieve these goals.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more
sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is
complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And
given that fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance
between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face.
Our second acquisition was GreenSky, which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to
build the consumer banking platform of the future. It provides our Consumer business with an attractive and high
credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants and a secularly
growing market.
It adds a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform.
And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale through
recurring fee-based and net interest income revenues. Importantly, these customers will be our customers that
will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives.
Turning to page 1 of our presentation, we produced net revenues of $13.6 billion, driven by year-on-year
increases in three of our four business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and
quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over
$17.5 billion are higher than any full year results in our history and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROTE of
over 27%.
Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. In
Investment Banking, we produced our second-highest quarterly revenues. Our clients were extremely active and
they turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to
elevated levels. We delivered solid results in Global Markets as we continue to focus on market share and
engage with clients on a broader array of solutions.
In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced
by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we
have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients,
raising $90 billion against our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day.
And in Consumer/Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong long-
term fee-based inflows in the first nine months of the year and had big client wins in Ayco that give us the
opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million
customers to spend, borrow and save on a multi-product platform. All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on
our clients, and relentless execution of our strategy strengthen my confidence that we will continue to advance
our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders.
Let me now turn to page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but
there is increasing uncertainty behind a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain
accommodative and equity markets are still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the
world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic's effects on the global economy. And as
technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus.
That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the
trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty

around the Delta variant. Third, there's ongoing political debate in the US over economic policy, including the
potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the Federal debt ceiling and tax
increases. And fourth, the US-China relationship remains complicated.
Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth, as further indicated by the downward
revision in our economist's US GDP expectations earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I
consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our
differentiated advice and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for
Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in Investment Banking,
and we have solid momentum in our Asset Management client business.
Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly three decades of service to the firm. I've had the
privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship
over the last 20 years. In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, a
25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs who has held numerous leadership positions within Investment Banking, most
recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. He and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for
almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen.

Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders, and the analyst community
over the past three years as CFO, and I am committed to facilitating a smooth handoff to Denis who, as Carey
noted, has joined us on the call today.
On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on page 4. I'm pleased to start
with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second-highest
quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in Investment Banking is a reflection of
both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive
position.
Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our number one league table
position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of
32%. M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and
healthcare, and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial
sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market.
Underwriting results were strong, notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the
first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with
revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with
volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%.
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $726 million with performance supported by solid high-yield and
investment-grade issuance as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A
announcements and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our Investment Banking backlog nonetheless
ended the quarter significantly higher than year-end levels.
Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle-market lending, and
the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In transaction banking, we achieved our five-year goal of
$50 billion in deposits this quarter, well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very
large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding
customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain
confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion.
Moving to Global Markets on page 5, segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-
year driven by healthy client activity, notably in equities, and a generally supportive market-making environment
characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. Results were also supported by recent market share gains
across FICC and Equities. Global Markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our
Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost.
Turning to page 6, our FICC businesses generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in
FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit, and mortgages offset by
materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of
the quarter, with September proving to be a very strong month. Our commodities business continued to perform
well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas and power.
FICC financing revenues of $513 million were the best in over a decade and were up meaningfully driven by
mortgage lending, consistent with our strategy. Total Equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by
higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash and record equities
financing as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients.
Moving to Asset Management on page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management
and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our
money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients, consistent with industry practice in this low-
rate environment.
Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private
investment portfolio plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4
billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions which, by contrast, were
material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly
$200 million related to our CIE portfolio.
Staying with Asset Management, page 8 again provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt
positions by vintage, region and, where relevant, accounting treatment. On page 9, we show a longer time series
of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020
Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion which have been partially offset by mark-ups on
the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion which include early fund facilitation and other commitments.
The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our
2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental
private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this

strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during
the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions.
Moving to page 10, Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter.
In Wealth Management, very strong long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record
management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which rose 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year.
Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds.
Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12%, with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion
sequentially as demand for lending products remains high amid the low-rate environment. I would add that we
view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the
needs of our clients and our current penetration rates as well as the strong credit standing of this client base.
Consumer Banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit
balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022 given the pending acquisitions of
GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product set.
Looking across these two segments, page 11 shows our firmwide assets under supervision and management and
other fees. We've been building these businesses steadily, and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion,
putting us in the top five of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven
higher firmwide management and other fees which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion.
On page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firmwide NII was
$1.6 billion for the third quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in
interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $143 billion, up $12 billion sequentially,
reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected
portfolio growth.
On page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.6 billion. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date
stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance
culture and investing for growth. Our year-to-date non-compensation expenses were down 17% but up 11% ex-
litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis.
Turning to capital on slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter under the
standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation,
the decline was driven largely by a $43 billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations
based on regulatory feedback in the quarter.
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1
billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will
prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns and then return any excess to shareholders
via dividends and share repurchases.
In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance reflecting the diversification and strength of our
client franchise. Additionally, we announced two acquisitions that will enhance both our Asset Management and
Consumer businesses and increase the firm's recurring revenue stream. Looking forward, the overall opportunity
set remains attractive across the firm as we continue to execute on our strategy we are building towards a path to
sustainable mid-teens returns.

With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. Stephen, I wonder if I could ask a quick follow-up question on your comments just now on capital.
So you make a ton of money; book is up 21% year-on-year, amazing. You did the GreenSky and NNIP deals, but
RWA was up because activity was strong and SA-CCR is coming. So I wonder if you could just peel back the
onion a little bit more and just talk about where you see your excess position now and if at the margin we should
be expecting continued investment in, say, the digital consumer build at the margin more so than the buyback
side. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to
deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that especially when returns are as attractive as they
have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it stood to reason, and consistent with that, that we
deploy the capital in the business. I'd also point out that in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2.00 a share, up
from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the
dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive, we'll return capital back and that really
represents what we do in terms of share repurchase.
Now in terms of the opportunity set you referred into the Consumer business, it's unquestionably a priority. David
has reflected time and again the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to
the firm, but I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity. It is a broad
look across the firm and we think always about how do we add in an agile way deployed capital across the whole
of the business, so I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against any one in particular.
Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore surplus
is less. And we, and consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be, in effect, a petition on capital
that we know. SA-CCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on
implementation, and we'll let our regulators know when we do, we're looking forward to that. And our view is that
when we put SA-CCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis
points.
It is at that level in part because as we look back when SA-CCR was finalized by Basel in 2014 and then adopted
by the Fed in 2018 and 2019, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect. So the implementation now
reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And
obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuant to the rules could
play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio
now relative to what it would have been. And so sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete
picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That was comprehensive. I appreciate it, take no offense. Look, one last follow-up. Because year-to-date
revenues are up 42% and so strong, you made a ton of money, comp dollars accrued are up 34%. I wonder if we
could talk about that a little bit in terms of comp leverage. I know it's a bottom-up and I know a lot of people at
Goldman Sachs are killing it this year, but I think 1MDB impacted things last year. So just thinking full year-to-full
year comp ratio, anything on the puts and takes on what to expect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So maybe I start with the numbers and then I'll turn it to David who I think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy
generally. But where we are right now, comp to net revenue net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through nine
months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. We always reserve for compensation, consistent
with what's required of us which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance as at
that date. Obviously, there's a quarter to go, so we're at a 31% ratio revenue net of provision for credit loss.
You can see through nine months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the two numbers, that number is
up 34%, again reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly.
That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of
provisions up 56%. So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we
believe to be a healthy and robust comp process.
I think overall, if you look at total operating expenses, because we look at it that way, including our non-comp
expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business. Again, revenues up
42%, but total operating expenses ex-litigation are up 24%, and so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in
operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically.
But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Glenn, I appreciate the question. I know one of the things you're getting at, there's no question there's comp
pressure. There's wage inflation everywhere at all aspects of every business right now. We're extremely focused
on it. We are a pay-for-performance culture, and there's no question that people are performing. But we're very,
very comfortable that we're managing this in a way where we can show real operating leverage to our
shareholders given our performance and, at the same time, pay our people exceptionally for the exceptional
performance. And we're on top of it and we feel good about it.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Good morning, David and Stephen and then welcome, Denis. Firstly, just echo David's sentiment about Stephen,
congratulations and definitely will be very big shoes to fill, for sure. So my first question here is on the digital
consumer bank. That business continues to do very well. Year-to-date revenue growth is an impressive 30%, but
that still lags some of the pure-play neobanks out there.
And some of that might just be a function of product holes, I think a check in payment functions and investment
functions and Marcus a little bit light. So curious here how you think about the product roadmap from here for
Marcus, the potential to use M&A to fill some of those product gaps. And then longer term, how should we think
about sort of sustainable revenue growth for that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I'll start, and Stephen may add some comments. But this is, Christian, this is something that we're focused
on over the long term. I think we've built an excellent platform. From a standing start of zero, in five years we've
built a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small
marketing budget or customer acquisition costs.
The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient vis-à-vis other models. We
have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really
differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships but also have the opportunity for a proprietary card
that's in development.
We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's
expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And as was highlighted in the
starting comments, their tech platform, their cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're
doing. And so, we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential
business. We have a long-term view with it.
I'm not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage. Unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to
look at a revenue growth model, we're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable, recurring
net earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in
a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow and we will do that.
I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, the only thing I'd add, Christian, is if you just look at the year-over-year comparison, right, so you can't forget
that we went through kind of a more challenging period in COVID where we, by design, looked to limit the amount
of underwriting we were doing. We're now coming back to sort of turn that back on having seen the portfolio
perform very well. So year-over-year revenues in consumer are up 23% in the deposit line, they're up 54% in
credit cards, and that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out
that business and seeing it perform.
And I think David's comments are spot on. If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card, soon to be joined by
General Motors, the investing module and checking, this is – what's coming into focus is a big, broad platform that
can serve customers in all of their needs as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set. And I
think we're at a key moment now with the acquisition of GreenSky to sort of take that forward.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Great. Thank you. My second question maybe is on back to trading. A bit of a high-class problem here, but the
results is just another quarter of market share gains in the trading businesses, but the share gains have been so
dramatic over the last few years that one has to wonder how sticky it could be going forward. So just curious how
you think about sustainability of share gains in the trading business as we roll into sort of 2022 and 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, Christian, I appreciate your focus on the share gains. I don't – I think it's a really important part and highlight
of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out going back to Investor Day. And so,
I think there are a couple of things that we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the
position of this business, and I think that we're accruing results that will be quite sticky. And I don't want to say
that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't; we know that. But we positioned the
business much, much better for I think two principal reasons.
Number one, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric One GS culture to really figure
out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way. The business has been less transactional, more
long-term-focused on the client relationship and the level of client service while bringing to bear the market-
making, provisioning, and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients
that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business and it's accruing to market share gains. It's
benefiting us in that context.
Number two, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we
could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our financing
capability across both Equities and FICC, and we succeeded on that and that's a place where we've taken market
share. And that is more durable share obviously, and we continue to think there are opportunities that we can
continue to prosecute on the financing side, and that's different.
I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology and we have the scale and
have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the
things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the tech necessity, have an advantage to
secondary or tertiary players, and so we're benefiting from that also. Now, there's no question this is a very
conducive environment, the performance of that business, and we're not sitting here saying this level of
performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made certainly
takes us a step-function up from where we were in 2019.
I'd also say as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so, even
if we went back to a different level, we're at a higher hurdle/return rate and the business at lower levels, and so
we feel very good about the way the business is positioned.

So I wanted to start off with a question, it's nearly a multi-faceted one on just sponsors in the alternative space.
Sponsors have been really a significant and clearly growing contributor to increased M&A activity these last 12
months; you guys have certainly benefited from that.
But as someone with unique perspective into the business just given you're building out your own third party
alternatives platform, and you cited some really impressive fundraising numbers, I was hoping you could just
speak to how much longer this frenzied pace of both fundraising and deal activity could persist and whether there
are any factors we should be watching, whether it's tax reform or higher rates that could potentially derail some of
that momentum.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, and I'll try to talk at a high level about some of this, Steve. And I think you're right; we're at a moment in time
where the activity levels are quite high. First, on fundraising, I'd just say that one of the reasons why we got very
focused a few years ago in a much more organized way growing our third party capital and building institutional
relationships to add to our alternatives platform is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital
allocation into alternatives. And as you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments and
sovereign wealth funds of broad institutions, all of them or a broad array of them are increasing their allocation to
alternatives.
I think in addition, there's no question that we're in a position, the world is in a position where retail participation
through wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space, and so there's more access being
offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra-wealthy individuals, but that
access is broadening more significantly. And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular
growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad, global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well-
positioned for that, and so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted.
With respect to deal activity, there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a
much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when
sponsor activity has increased, it runs for a while but then ultimately there'll be something that backs it off. We're
watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about
risk management around that.
It feels at the moment, given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the re-
acceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic that this will run for some while. But that's also
something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace. There'll certainly be
speed bumps along the way.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks, David, for all of that color. And maybe just for my follow-up, a question, Stephen, just on equity
investment and the impact to capital. One of the primary drivers of future SCB reduction which you've talked
about is the harvesting of those equity investments. We know they get very punitive treatment in CCAR and this is
a high-class problem.
Shrinking the investments at least on a net basis has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that
$20 billion level. How much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your SCB? And is
that 13% to 13.5% CET1 target still the appropriate long-term bogey just given some of the stubbornly high equity
investments that have persisted for the better part of a couple of years now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with the end part of your question. Our strongly-held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right
place for this firm to operate. Now, our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise
requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is
candidly taking action into our own hands, meaning we're not waiting for petitions to be well-received in order that
that requirement comes down. But instead, we're pivoting and moving from balance sheet into fund format.
I think if you look at page 9 in our deck, what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions
and what that has meant for AE free-up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. In the last nine months, we've seen
reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion, corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE. Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of
reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE, and we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8
billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE.
I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on that will
continue. And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day we would experience a bit of a canyon
if you will of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace, faster slope
than what might have been a yawning line if you will to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening. As
David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising which – and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS which is
fee-paying. And so that transition is being managed well and this just gives you a sense of the overall capital
reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So balance sheet growth has stepped up since the pandemic and it's something we've kind of been waiting for
really kind of since the great financial crisis. Can you talk a bit about how much of that growth has really been
driven by client demand for balance sheet, which would be a good thing, versus just being a function of kind of
QE and the flood of liquidity in the market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I would say that much of the balance sheet growth that has gone on has been attributed to client activity. If
you just look at segment-by-segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in Investment Banking that
supports our M&A franchise, you look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and Equities that
were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability and
the forward in our trading business. And so, a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients.
I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation, meaning we
have various risk metrics that are in place. Capital has obviously grown. liquidity maintained at the firm obviously
grows in the form of our GCLA. And so all of these I think are meant to be read in tandem in the context of serving
clients but doing that in a way where balance sheet growth is held in the context of various risks, be it capital and
liquidity profile of the firm itself.
We're not, we are not a bank notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are
experiencing the kind of outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger
commercial banks, and that is inflating balance sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation frankly in part
because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very useable deposits as a substitute for
wholesale funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And as we think about the kind of recurring question for a number of quarters now, capital markets and kind
of how sustainable are these really strong activity levels, understanding that you can't predict that things could
shut off tomorrow, how do you think about things like Investment Banking and Global Markets when you look at
kind of the budgeting process into next year and maybe the year beyond? I mean, how do you approach that?
What's your outlook from that perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think our outlook, there are a confluence of things, Jeff, that are going on that are obviously quite
accommodative for this. You're right; at any point in time, that mix could change and we wouldn't see the same
robust amount of client activity. But we have fundamental growth in markets, we have fundamental growth in
economic activity around the world, and that over periods of time grows long-term growth in these business
platforms.
So I certainly would say we're running at very, very robust capital markets activity in the Investment Banking
franchise at the moment. But I'd also say whenever things slowdown or rebalance a little, we're going to find that
14

these businesses are, baseline, fundamentally larger than they were five years ago because the growth in market
cap of the world and the growth in economic activity in the world.
And so, we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity, there's a real
correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow. But we have lots of
flexibility in the context of the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think, will continue to be
strong performers even in different environments; they just might not perform at this level all the time.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hey. So we talked a little bit earlier about market share and market share opportunities. I just wanted to take a
slightly different angle on that and ask the question about where you think you're punching below your weight, if
we could think about that being an opportunity from a regional perspective. So especially in Europe or Latin
America, maybe Asia, you could speak to where you think you have opportunities in those regions. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean, I'd point to a couple things at a high level, Betsy. There's no question one of the reasons why NN was
really attractive to us is that in our Asset Management business, we've been punching below our weight across
Europe both in terms of the assets that we were supervising but also in our distribution capabilities, and NN
accelerates that. I still think there's more opportunity there. I do think around some of the public portion of our
GSAM business across the world, there's still opportunities for us to punch at a better weight even though at this
point we're one of the top five active asset managers, and so we continue to think about that as an opportunity.
I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business in particular in Europe, and we've
been focused on that. I think there are Wealth Management opportunities for us in the US as we move from
simply managing money with ultra-high-net worth clienteles that have been our traditional PWM business to a
more mass-affluent structure and using digital technology and expanding the use of Ayco. China is another place
where there's opportunity for us from a Wealth Management perspective, and you've seen we've announced our
joint venture with ICBC which we think is an interesting opportunity in that part of the world. And so those are a
handful of things from a regionalized basis I would highlight.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I was wondering if you could just kind of mark-to-mark us on your tech successes or initiatives. As you mentioned,
year-to-date growth in revenues is two to three times that of expenses, so you're getting the higher marginal
margin. Now, some of that's due to the bull market. You mentioned comp leverage. But then how much of that is
due to technology? So I guess one way to phrase this question is by area. So you have your new growth
initiatives.
You mentioned digital deposits of $100 billion, transaction banking deposits of $50 billion, so that would – I think
that's borne in the cloud. And then you have your legacy trading activities where I guess there's been a lot of
electronification, then there's the rest of the company where I'm not really sure what the tech backbone is. So the
question is, how much has the tech backbone contributed to that higher marginal margin for each of the growth
areas, trading and the rest of the firm?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I'll start, Mike, and Stephen, I'm sure, will have some things to add here, too. At a high level, we're spending
significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on to better connect to our clients and to
enable us obviously to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment, but our commitment to
continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the cloud for a variety of
reasons, which I'll highlight in just a second, I think, is something that we've been very focused on strategically
and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path.
Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build and host technology. And
cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their
time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly
service our clients' needs rather than doing what I call as undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech builds that
managed what was more traditional tech infrastructure.
The cloud really provides low-friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics which
enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to
16


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
connect with us. And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of
them like transaction banking and some of the things we're doing on the Marcus platform.
And so. there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. We know that the
cloud is not for everything, and so there were some services, and I'll give you an example, like high frequency
trading that are better served on-premise, and so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment. And we also choose
our partners in kind of a multi-cloud or what we call a poly-cloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed
offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do
for our clients.
So overall, we're in this journey that's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering
better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently, and I think we're getting real benefit from it in
the execution of our strategy. But I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial cloud, so
to speak, for some of our principal businesses.
I mean, Stephen, would you add anything to that or do you want to quantify some things a little more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add was a bit of quantification. So, Mike, if you heard me say before, our non-comp
expenses, so excluding litigation, just looking at the core non-comp expense year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at
the gross expense that that represents, about a third of that increase is related to technology; so about a third of
the increase of non-compensation expense in the firm through the first nine months relates to technology. And
this is spent all across the firm, so it's both in particular initiatives like consumer, TxB, Marquee. But equally, it's
spent broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm. Cloud-based engineering is one that David
brought to your attention.
In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so as an example, part of the uplift will enable us
to create greater opportunity for automation which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I'd just
offer that to you just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was
otherwise describing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just a follow-up, maybe digging deeper on transaction banking. I've been a little skeptical, but you did get
your five-year target as you said. And so if you think about the cloud, cloud-enabled, cloud-native or I think in that
case born in the cloud, can you just define really what that means? Is that the nirvana state of being in the cloud,
the way you have transaction banking? And to what degree has that contributed to you getting your $50 billion?
And by the way, does that $50 billion include any deposits from Goldman Sachs itself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So I don't believe that there are GS deposits in it. It's $50 billion of gross deposits and, as we've said, that's now
become about 25% operational, so a value to us. But just to come back to your question about the cloud, so the
TxB business was built entirely in the cloud. I don't know that I would necessarily conclude that that is why it's
been successful. I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built
17


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(GS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a draw card in the context of
it.
The reason, Mike, is kind of self-evident which is that it's built in the cloud. As David noted, it's not built with
multiple instances of the transaction banking platform across redundant data centers. It benefits without
necessarily costing us to sort of improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like that is the benefit of
sitting within the cloud itself. So I can't tell you that I could draw a line to the deposits that have come in. I can tell
you that we've built it better, cheaper and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client attention and attraction to it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
The one thing, though – the one thing, Mike, that I want to add very, very clearly. The reason our transaction
banking platform is, I think, accelerating in its success is because the quality of the offering for our clients is
differentiated and better meeting their needs than the existing offerings. And part of the reason, as Stephen
highlighted, we could do that so quickly was because it's easier to build in the cloud and transition. But
fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform that took friction out of an
activity that was deeply embedded in our corporate clients.
As a user of that activity, we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that that experience could be
improved, and we've built a platform that delivers a better experience, and that's why it's succeeding, that's why
it's meeting targets and continuing to grow, and that's why we're very optimistic. Stephen laid out to you $1 billion
of revenue; we're confident in that target. And this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor, and so
we're very confident about how we'll continue to execute. But fundamentally, it's about the quality of the product
we're delivering to our clients.

Sure. I mean, I'll start here. And appreciate the question, Brennan, but first, it's a very different company; it's an
independent public company than it is as a platform inside Goldman Sachs. And one of the big weaknesses of the
company as an independent public company is it didn't have a funding model and it had to fund differently. Inside
Goldman Sachs where we have funding and attractive funding, it becomes a technology platform that allows us to
connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the markets' ecosystem.
I think the merchant network that they developed with over 10,000 merchants and they developed over 15 years
is extremely valuable. And then, the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that,
we think it would've taken us close to 10 years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that
network, bring in very, very high-quality customers – these are customers that own homes, these are customers
that have high FICO scores – very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs. It allowed us to do something that fits
seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing. And so we
feel very, very good about it and we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20%-plus returns on the
activity that it generates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that, David. Maybe following-up on that, could you provide some context around the strategic
priorities from here? You've done two recent acquisitions, smaller, bolt-on size but certainly a bit of activity. When
you think about the different businesses in which you want to grow, you've done a lot of these smaller bolt-ons,
some in the wealth side with United Capital and Folio several years ago and NN and GreenSky more recently.
Going from here, is there any particular business that you think is quite compelling given either some combination
of ripe inorganic opportunities that the market might be under-appreciating similar to – or the platform can be
different within Goldman than it is as a stand-alone the way it was with GreenSky? How should investors think
about priorities and direction from here and how they stack?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Brennan. I'll bring you back – I really want to bring you back and center you around what we said during our
Investor Day. We laid out a strategy that said we will continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market
share and increase the positioning. I think we've done that. There's still some opportunities to continue to do that,
but we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position
while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business.
And when you look at those areas, it's transaction banking, it's Asset Management, it's Wealth Management, and
it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all four of
those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically. But when there are opportunities to make an
acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take
a hard look at it.
As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there is still
opportunities, and maybe opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas.
But we are focused on those four areas because those four areas diversify the durability of our revenues and
allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll
continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question, just want to dig in a little bit on Asset Management and the
opportunity on the third party alternatives, fundraising, and just the ability to continue to scale that both on kind of
the customer side and product side. And when we look at some of the I guess stand-alone alternative manager
peers, they've done a great job in recent years of expanding the product menu and then consolidating LP
relationships where they're connecting on numerous products, and so that effectively creates a network effect.
And so looking at Goldman, where do you guys feel like you are with LPs? And is the opportunity to add more
LPs or there's a bigger opportunity to connect with more Goldman Sachs product? And then I guess on the
product side, alternatives, are there any areas where you feel like you could accelerate investment or those could
be areas that could help you connect I guess with your LPs, existing LPs on more products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I appreciate the question, Devin. It's obviously something strategically we've been very focused on, but I'll go back
to some of the things that we said at Investor Day that kind of geared us toward our focus on this. We've been in
these businesses for a long time and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated in that we have
a truly broad, global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years. We
have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure, and we also have them
globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that
broad array but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we're set up.
What was differentiated or different about our business in alternatives before we rolled it together and got it
focused is generally, our LP relationships came through our private wealth network. And we raised an enormous
amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm. While we had some
institutional LP relationships, we had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform.
And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a
One GS approach at really taking a long-term view and building relationships with those institutional partners, we
could grow our partnership with them. So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our
ecosystem. And if you look at Strategic Solutions which we raised last year, there were a number of, probably a
dozen new significant institutional LPs that the first time they were coming onto our platform was in that Strategic
Solutions Fund.
So I think there's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that, it's something we're very focused on. But the
opportunity for us is less in product addition, although we are adding products. We just raised the Horizon Fund
which is an ESG-centered fund to allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies, and we'll add other
product capabilities that we think are interesting. But our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs
platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand the list of institutional LPs
that are partnered with us, and I think we have a lot of upside to run on that.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thank you. Just one question. David, address to us how you're thinking about just digital assets. As you're
seeing the entire ecosystem being built around digital asset custody, tokenization, just give us a perspective
because it feels like all of that would be right in Goldman's wheelhouse to capitalize as some of these things
accelerate. So would love to hear your perspective on, one, how you see just that entire ecosystem developing
and the role Goldman can play in that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So there's no question that activities that we're involved in are digitizing quickly. I think there's a meaningful
acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring. There are places that that
digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position. The two we've talked about a bunch today on this
call that are happening because of digital infrastructure, our ability to do what we're doing in transaction banking is
taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way. What we're doing in building a digital
consumer bank is also relying on this.
The broader digital ecosystem I think is in early stages. I think we're at Version 1.0. I think you'll continue to see a
lot of disruption on traditional ways that financial services are delivered and consumed. I think big competitive
platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are intermediated. I think there are lots of
complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this
as the technology allows for more disruption. But I think we're very early in the game and I think it is a big
opportunity for the firm, and the firm continues to be focused on it.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping you could just elaborate on what drove the increase in RWAs from the regulatory
guidance this quarter, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So we had about a $42 billion increase in RWAs. About half of that related to the changes in the
methodology that we're using in the computation of the RWAs, and that was the byproduct of just routine and
ongoing discussion with regulators. And so that plays through in the third quarter ratio, will play through on the
forward, but that's really the source of about 50% of the RWA lift. The other 50% is obviously in the context of the
overall business and risk and exposure that's attending there.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hey, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Stephen, can you share with us – you mentioned in transaction banking you got to the $50 billion in deposits
which is ahead of schedule and you're still confident you're going to reach the $1 billion in revenues. Back in
Investor Day when you gave us those numbers, were those numbers linked, meaning were they supposed to kind
of be achieved around the same time? And then second, when do you think you'll reach that $1 billion target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So the targets were set at the same time, though bear in mind the environment then and now is quite
different in the context of interest rates. So we've seen Fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day – I
don't know, I want to say about 150 basis points, maybe a little more. The consequence of that is that the value of
deposits, the economic value of deposits is not as rich now as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally,
in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits otherwise
modeled out.
And therefore, on the forward rate curve our view is that we'll be able to achieve that $1 billion revenue target. I'd
point out that of the $50 billion, more of them are operational. That's sort of step one to achieving the value of
that, and that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. And I think more
broadly in transaction banking, about two-thirds of the revenue from the time we modeled it through now is
correlated to deposit intake, with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come
back, the value of those deposits will as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of
our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If additional questions arise in
the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, please
stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
