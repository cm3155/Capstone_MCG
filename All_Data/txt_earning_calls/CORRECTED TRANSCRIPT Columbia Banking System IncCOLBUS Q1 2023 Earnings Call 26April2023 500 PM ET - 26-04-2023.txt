Jacquelynne Bohlen
Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter 2023
results which we released shortly after the market close today. The earnings release and corresponding
presentation which we will refer to during our remarks this afternoon are available on our website at
columbiabankingsystem.com.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Jacque. Good afternoon, everyone. It was an extraordinary first quarter for Columbia. We closed our
merger with Umpqua Holdings Corporation on February 28, reinforcing Umpqua Bank's position as the largest
bank headquartered in the Northwest and creating one of the largest banking franchises headquartered in the
West. At $54 billion in assets, our broader scale and additional products and services enable us to meet the
needs in the west. At $54 billion in assets, our broader scale and additional products and services enable us to
meet the needs of our customer base in expanded ways.
Over the past 18 months, our organization has attracted top talent in new and existing markets. These leaders
and teams alongside our seasoned longtime bankers continue to win new business and expand existing
relationships. This activity has thrived despite the ongoing preparation for the integration of Columbia and
Umpqua. I'm very proud of what our team accomplished during the first quarter. In addition to closing the merger,
we also completed two branch divestiture projects and successfully converted our core systems. Careful planning
and the dedication of our exceptionally talented team enabled us to achieve these accomplishments.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
I want to thank our associates for their commitment and diligence throughout this busy period. It has enabled us
to remain on track to realize our targeted cost savings by the end of the third quarter. In addition to the heightened
activity surrounding the merger, our associates were also engaged with customers throughout the industry events
that unfolded in March. We were uniquely positioned during this period given our robust customer engagement
surrounding the core systems conversion. Our teams were able to expand conversations already taking place to
discuss Columbia's diversified business model, granular deposit base, and tailored solutions for those looking to
add products like our insured cash sweep service.
It was a historic first quarter for our company. Our customers, associates and communities are already benefiting
from enhancements provided by the merger. We remain committed to supporting communities throughout our
eight-state footprint as evidenced by our five-year, $8 billion Community Benefits Agreement. This agreement
supports community development, expanded homeownership, and small business formation. In that light, I'm
pleased to announce we contributed $20 million to the Umpqua Bank Charitable Foundation in March. With the
merger closed, our shareholders will quickly begin to realize the expected benefits of our strengthened operations
and improved financial performance, along with significant capital accretion.
And now I'll turn the call over to you, Ron.

Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. And for those on the call who want to follow along, I will be referring to certain page
numbers from our earnings presentation. Starting on slide 4, now that we've closed the merger, we present here
updated overall financial metrics expected as compared to the original projections in October of 2021. The
changes in fair value since then led to significant rate-related discounts which will accrete to interest income over
time. With that, our tangible book dilution was larger, but our expected GAAP accretion and return on tangible
equity increases significantly with a similar earn-back. With our core system conversion completed a month ago,
we are on track to achieve our expected cost synergies of $135 million on an annualized basis by the end of the
third quarter this year.
Next, on slide 5, we present updated fair value marks at closing as compared to announcement. Given the
increase in treasury yields and inversion of the 10 versus 2 spreads since announcement, we ended with $1.76
billion in discount marks, with all but $130 million of that related to rate. Again, these rate discounts will accrete to
interest income providing a significant and stable additional earnings stream over time, which we'll highlight in a
few minutes. Also noted lower in the page is the larger core deposit intangible balance, which will be amortized to
expense over time.
On slide 6, we carry forward the discount marks and CDI at closing and also present the current balances as of
quarter end. For the AFS securities discount, the decline from closing to quarter end resulted from writing off
existing premiums at close of roughly $200 million along with removing the discounts of $165 million on the $1.2
billion of bonds sold as part of a restructuring. The remaining decline of approximately $15 million was accreted to
interest income.
Slide 7 projects our cost synergy realization estimate at quarter end through the year. On an annualized basis, we
estimate we've realized $25 million of cost synergies in the month of March run rate, with an additional $21 million
achieved post conversion which will reduce our run rate in April. Looking forward, we expect to realize a further
$59 million to $64 million in annualized cost savings by the end of the second quarter or approximately $15 million
to $16 million on a quarterly basis, achieving these synergies evenly throughout the quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Slide 8 covers our liquidity, including deposit flows during the quarter. For comparability, we presented the table
on the left as if we were combined for all periods presented. Total deposits declined 4.9% in the first quarter, or
3.6% when excluding the divestiture required with the combination. Market liquidity tightening and the impact of
inflation on consumer spending continued to pressure customer deposit balances. We utilized short-term federal
home loan bank borrowings to fund the outflows, along with adding $2 billion for higher on balance sheet liquidity.
The upper right table details our off balance sheet liquidity with $9.7 billion available as of quarter end. Below that,
we had cash and excess bond collateral not pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of $17.9 billion.
This represents 121% of uninsured deposits as of quarter end.
On the next page, slide 9, we detail out the investment portfolio. The upper left table takes you from current par to
amortized cost to fair value, noting the difference between current par and amortized cost is the combined net
discount, which will be accreted to interest income over time. The $94 million of gross unrealized gains at quarter
end came primarily from the marked Columbia portfolio as the bond market rallied in March, while the gross
unrealized losses related to the prior Umpqua bonds, which were not marked.
I mentioned earlier, we saw $1.2 billion of marked Columbia bonds the first week of March and re-invested $0.9
billion as part of a restructuring. We sold front-end cash flows and purchased longer dated bonds to extend
duration slightly, benefiting our interest rate sensitivity, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
The chart on the right breaks out the overall portfolio between the portion with unrealized gains versus losses.
Noting $6.1 billion of the book is in a gain position with a book yield of 4.53% as of quarter end. As you can tell,
I'm excited about this portfolio as it gives us significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater
optionality.
The overall book yield is 3.62% with an effective duration of 5.7 at quarter-end. And lastly, we only have $2.4
million in [ph] HGM (00:09:40) bonds, which represents some CRA-related bonds with no unrealized loss.
Now to better help investors, given the combination accounting and moving parts, on slide 10, we provide an
updated outlook for the remainder of the year on several key financial statement items. The accretion estimates
noted on the lower half of the table accrete based on the effective interest method, meaning they should be fairly
stable in the near term and declining slightly over the life of the portfolios. They will provide significant interest
income and capital build over time. We also provide an updated outlook for our quarterly expense run rate, which
we expect to be in the $260 million to $270 million range in Q2 when CDI amortization and merger expenses are
excluded. We expect this level to trend down to $240 million and $250 million in Q4, reflecting the expected
achievement of all communicated expense synergies by the end of the third quarter.
Slides 12 through 14 provide summary financials for Q1, but I want to take you forward to slide 15. Here, we
break out Q1 GAAP earnings to help investors understand the non-operating and merger related impacts and
resulting poor bank results in the far right column. The first column represents our Q1 GAAP results, with a net
loss of $14 million driven entirely by merger expense, along with the initial ACL provision.
The second column includes our non-operating destination for income statement changes mostly related to fair
value swings, along with $116 million of merger costs included in non-interest expense, which are detailed in the
appendix. These net to an $86 million reduction in Q1 earnings, resulting in a third column for operating income.
This is the key page, the bridge from GAAP reported earnings isolating non-operating fair value changes in the
merger related items of discount accretion, CDI amortization and the CECL [ph] day two double account
(00:11:43) then to adjusted operating income.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Now in the merger-related items column, we have $32 million of net discount accretion from the March discussed
earlier for one month. Along with the $88 million initial ACL provision, commonly referred to as the CECL [ph] day
two double account (00:12:01). Also included is $13 million of CDI amortization for the one month. The value in
this column will be a clear view of the net earnings impact from the merger accounting, which will be substantial
and again build capital over time.
And that takes us to the far right column which presents the bank excluding the merger accounting marks. Again,
the interest rate environment introduced a significant amount of purchase accounting accretion and amortization
into our reported earnings, and slide 15 breaks out the components. This will enable investors to view the
earnings power of Columbia outside purchase accounting adjustments, while also seeing the meaningful net
capital generation we expect these adjustments to produce over time.
Okay with that, moving ahead for a couple more items, slide 17 breaks out accretion from net interest income and
slide 18 does the same for the margin. In the footnote, we highlight the NIM for just the month of March with
4.31% as reported and 3.55% excluding the accretion. The excess liquidity held on balance sheet had a 10 basis
point impact on the month of March NIM, but an insignificant impact on net interest income.
Slide 19 breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio, noting 46% is fixed, 24% is
floating, and 30% are adjustable. Slide 20 provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity
under both ramp and shock scenarios. We've taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to
a potential declining rate environment, including the bond portfolio restructuring discussed earlier, along with
using short-term wholesale borrowings. Combined with more locked out bond cash flows, this acts like a swap for
[ph] rates down (00:13:56) environments.
You can see here the trend over the past few quarters where a rates-down risk has been reduced significantly.
And noted below, we calculate our cycle-to-date funding betas which are calculated on a combined company
basis over the periods presented for comparability. As of the first quarter, our interest-bearing deposit portfolio
has priced in 28% of the Fed funds' rate increases. Notably, here is the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which
was 1.33% for the month of March compared with the quarter-end spot rate of 1.43% highlighting stability.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.

Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron. Turning to slide 23, the addition of the historical Columbia loans at fair value was the primary
driver of the quarter's loan growth as new originations were nearly offset by payment activity.
Slide 24 details select characteristics of our loan portfolio by major category with added details surrounding
production during the first quarter. Our portfolio is diversified by mix and geography. Average loan size displays
the granularity of the portfolio and, where applicable, average loan-to-value and debt service coverage supports
the quality of our underwriting.
Additional industry detail for our commercial portfolio is provided on slide 25, further highlighting our diversification
by industry and collateral type.
Let's spend a little time on slide 26, which provides an overview of our office portfolio in response to increased
investor focus on this asset category. Like other verticals, our office portfolio is characterized by a diversified mix

of granular loans that exhibit strong credit metrics. Our average office loan is $1.3 million. The average loan-to-
value of the portfolio is 57%. And the average debt service coverage of the non-owner occupied portion of the
portfolio is approximately 1.75 times.
Properties are located across our broad Western footprint, and majority are in suburban markets. We have very
limited exposure to core downtown metro markets. 83% of our office loans have a guarantee in place, and
performance of the portfolio remains exceptional. Past-due and non-accrual levels are de minimis at a combined
$1 million, and criticized balances represent only 2% of the overall portfolio and less than 20 basis points of our
total loan portfolio. We remain very comfortable with our office exposure, given the characteristics I've outlined.
Moving on, slide 27 highlights our reserve coverage by loan category with the majority of the quarters billed driven
by $32 million added as part of the merger for historical Columbia PCD loans and $88 million initial provision
booked for non-PCD loans. The remaining $17 million provision expense primarily reflects changes in the
economic forecasts using credit models.
Slide 28 provides an overview for our consolidated credit trends and notes the additional 28 basis points, the
remaining credit discount on loans, adds to our loss-absorbing capacity. Overall, our credit trends are benign
outside the anticipated trend and FinPac charge-offs. Delinquency in charge-off activity in the FinPac portfolio
remains centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio, and we believe delinquencies in this area have reached a
plateau as the supply/demand imbalance in this specific space evens out.
These factors drive our expectations for another quarter of elevated charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio as
delinquencies continue to roll through the later delinquency bands. We continue to view these trends as isolated
to the FinPac portfolio given the unique characteristics of their obligors, and we have obviously witnessed no
spillover to the broader commercial portfolio or other sectors within the FinPac portfolio. Excluding FinPac,
charge-off activity at the bank remains at a de minimis level. So, classified asset ratios did increase. They do not
represent any notable changes in classified asset balances when viewing the combined portfolio.
I will now turn the call over to Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank. Shifting the focus to deposits, slide 29 highlights the quality of our portfolio. 41% of balances
are in non-interest-bearing accounts. Of the overall, consumer balances comprised 41% of our base with the
average account balance at $20,000. Commercial balances make up the remaining 49% of our deposit portfolio
with the average account balance at $108,000. The company offers multiple deposit solutions like our insured
cash sweep service, the ability to collateralize select accounts, and opportunities for enhanced returns through
Columbia Wealth Management.
These products provide our customers with the flexibility they seek and improve the stability of our granular
deposit base. At quarter-end, just 36% of our deposit portfolio was uninsured, screening on the lower end of peer
averages. Net contraction in our deposit balances on an organic basis during the quarter reflects normal customer
uses of cash, the impact of inflation on spending, and market liquidity tightening. Offsetting these headwinds to
net expansion was continued growth in new account balances as customers transferred funds into recently
opened accounts throughout the quarter. We also continued the development of our franchise throughout the
West.

With the merger closed, we now have deposit and other capabilities in Utah, which further enables us to bring full
banking relationships to the company. We will continue to invest in this market and throughout our other
geographies. We believe this will lead to enhanced long-term organic growth opportunities. With the core systems'
conversion now complete, our teams have an invigorated focus on generating balanced growth for our franchise.
Relationship banking within our communities drives our purpose and our broader footprint, expanded set of
products and services, and our collaborative spirit across our teams support our expectations for continued
success.
And now back to you, Clint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. Our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide 30. We remain above both well-capitalized and
internal threshold targets. And as Ron outlined, we expect capital to free quickly in the coming quarters. As a
result of the merger, we have adjusted our dividend declaration timeline so that it is similar to the one previously
utilized by Umpqua Holdings.
This concludes our prepared comments. The team is now available to answer your questions. So, Valerie, please
open the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from
the line of Jeff Rulis of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I guess, to start, appreciate all the detail in the deck. Maybe I'd go first to the cost or the expense run rate. Ron,
you kind of rattled through that. I missed kind of those [ph] first (00:22:23) step as you go through the – through
Q3 and I guess you ended at $240 million to $250 million in Q4, but could you repeat that piece again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think you summarize it well. We've got – $25 million, we have included within our run rate for the month of
March. There's another $21 million that is in place, but at the end of the quarter, which will be reflected in Q2. So,

we talked about that. And then on that slide 7, we show you the ramp for the additional $59 million to $64 million
we expect to achieve on annualized basis in Q3, which will put us at the $135 million level by the end of Q3.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
$59 million to $64 million additional in second quarter and then the balance in Q3 will end at $135,000; annualized
again at the end of Q3. And looking forward in the guidance we gave for Q2 on the expense side reflects those
trends along with the Q4 amount noted in the far-right note column on that outlook page.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay, great. Thank you. And then the – I guess if I were to jump to capital, your comment about expect to accrete
that quickly. And I just – I don't know if you've got projections on kind of year-end or expectations for those capital
levels, and I guess that's question one. Question two would be: other tools with the deal closed now, do you look
at the buyback, the other ways of deploying that capital as that grows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jeff, this is Ron. On the first one, very much we have forecast on the capital build. And it's going to be a
range of 20 to 30 bps on the risk-based measures across the various separations over the course of the year and
into the following year and the year after. That's got a long life. This would be a long-life level of accretion that
also, [ph] interestingly enough (00:24:15), just given the nature of how rates have moved up over the last year,
you'd have to go significantly below where rates were prior to last year in order to see a real acceleration in
prepay on a lot of those instruments. So, excited about that. That 20, 30 bps would be a quarterly accretion in the
capital ratios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And, Jeff, this is Clint. I'll just add that as you do the math in terms of just what the accretion adds and then
factor in earnings, and you can pretty quickly reconcile Ron's comments and mine about the capital generation
and the capabilities of the company.
With respect to a buyback, I don't see anything this year. I think that just all the volatility that's out there and the
fact that we'll be building in the next couple of quarters to our long-stated, long-term target capital ratios. We'll let
that occur, and then if market conditions are favorable, by all means, it'd be something that Ron and myself would
have a discussion with our board and make sure that we're being good stewards and keeping the appropriate
amount of capital so we have flexibility to run our business through the entirety of any cycle, but also not have too
much capital sitting around that hurts our returns for our shareholders.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Okay. Thank you. And then maybe one last one for Chris. Just on the deposit side, could you comment on flows
in April so far? Is kind of the first part of that. And then second, you talked about expanding tools in the Utah. And
I guess your expectations for the growth through the end of the year, if you think you could scratch it from [ph] 331
(00:26:20) levels? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. Into April, with the conversion behind us, still early behind that, you're looking at getting some people back
out into the markets. We've also launched our own deposit promotion. Trends are good on that out of the gate,
and that's been out for a couple weeks. More, though, I'm starting to see, and I know Tory's seen this as well,
we're seeing clients and prospects that are coming to us requesting new business. Now, I can't put a dollar
amount on it for you right at this time, but it's certainly a very positive sign to see the new business flow that's
coming in, as well as the multiple conversations that are going on with existing clients around, one, retaining their
deposits and, two, looking at opportunities they might have with funds that are held elsewhere.
Expanding into Utah, we should be up and going sometime during the quarter to attracting the actual deposits and
would expect that team would hit the ground running on the loan side to be able to drive a good amount. Again, I
can't put a dollar amount on it, of exactly what we would get, but we're very – we've always been excited about
the market, and I don't see the experienced bankers that we have having any trouble bringing in deposits on that.
And then we will look into the other states where we have loan production offices as well, and I would say more to
come on that, but we're certainly looking to be full service across all eight states. And I don't know, Tory. Did you
want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, Jeff. This is Tory Nixon. I think the only thing I would add is that for the first three weeks of April, deposit
balances are down just a little bit, mostly in retail and consumer banking. And that's like typical tax payments and
just kind of traditional outflow; not significant at all. And to Chris' point, a lot of activity inside the commercial bank
on new relationships, prospecting funds, deposit funds from – for our customers from other institutions. So, a lot
of really, really good activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I guess put in another way, I guess by year-end, are you looking at, you know, in your budget from the [ph] 331
jump point (00:28:43) deposit balances, are you in a stable down or up type mindset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. No. I think there's a really great opportunity for us to grow the balances of the company, and we – all hands
on deck to do that. We are continuing to focus on C&I relationships and full banking relationships, and what
comes with that is core deposits, fee income, I mean, all those things that drive value for the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And Jeff, I'll just add, there's a bit of a wild card in there, and that's – it appears that we've returned to kind of
seasonal patterns that we haven't had for since pre-COVID. And if you go back prior to 2020 and throughout the
history of the company, a lot of the deposit, positive deposit flows occur in the second half of the year, and they

start to build late second quarter. So, in addition to the activities that Tory mentioned and Chris, there's that
seasonal pattern. And I would expect that that will return and behave as we've seen in the past.
But then the Fed's still removing liquidity from the system. And so – and I think there's still just – from an industry
perspective, there's still some of that activity that's yet to occur. So, that's why it's hard to just tell you, yeah, it's up
X percent. But I think I share the team's optimism on our ability to take market share and the conversations that
we're having, and that gets back to my prepared remarks along the lines of not only the new teams but our
seasoned bankers. They're continuing to win new business and deepen those existing relationships, and so I
think those activities, no matter what happens at a macro level, you'll see the positive benefit to our balance
sheet.

Maybe just kind of staying on the deposit side, I'd be curious maybe some of the flows that you saw in the quarter,
if you could just talk a bit about – you talked about a lot of it's really a function of the declining balances in existing
customers. I'm curious whether you saw that more on the commercial or the retail side and how much is that
seasonality versus customers utilizing cash to pay down the higher-cost floating rate debt, migration into the
wealth or versus turmoil from the banking failures or even the conversion.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
David, this is Ron. Let me take a crack at that. Pretty wide-ranging. But I'd say, overall, traditionally seasonally, it's
like a bell curve over the course of the year, right? Stronger Q2, Q3; a little bit more pressure, Q4, Q1, depending
on the segment, etcetera. And on page 8, we did lay out the changes in deposits in that upper-left table as if we
were pooled or combined on a basis for comparability purposes [ph] and like (00:32:33). When we look at the ex-
broker or the divestitures or the public deposit change on the customer account side, it's pretty evenly balanced
between commercial and consumer similar to just the overall mix of the portfolio, right? I think on the consumer
side, it feels like a similar continuation of the inflation story we talked about last quarter for – we're looking at Q4
results on the commercial side similar, so just the kind of effects of QT at the customer level utilizing cash from
that standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And, David, you asked, and then there was a lot packed into that, and you mentioned investments and
things moving away because we've talked about that in the past. And we saw very similar – I'd say it's probably a
little bit of a larger activities in historical averages on that. But the really nice thing about this combination now is
we have even more options that are available. And so, all of the clients aren't looking to immediately move into a
treasury bill or something of that nature with the insured cash that sweeps and the deposit promos that we have.
We've got – our bankers have multiple tools available for them based on what the clients' needs are. And I think
that just gives us maximum flexibility to solve the issue that they have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That makes sense. Maybe touching on the growth, the loan growth side, obviously, the market's pretty volatile
right now. But I'm curious how demand's trending from your standpoint, how new loan yields are, what segments
you're still seeing good risk-adjusted return? And maybe just – you probably have some unique opportunities for
growth just given the deal and some bigger targets and opportunities to increase relationships. Does that maybe
support outsized growth in the short run? I'm just curious how you think about organic loan growth opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
David, this is Tory Nixon. I think you kind of summarized a lot of things in that question. I think there's great
opportunity for the company to go forward and to do a lot of what you just described or just asked. I mean, I think
there's the ability for us to certainly serve markets in all of the states that we're in, whether it's small business,
whether it's in the consumer side, whether it's in commercial middle-market banking, in the real estate space. I
mean, we just have a lot of capability. We've got certainly the opportunity as a combined company to increase
hold levels and continue to expand credit facilities for customers, our customers, as they grow. I think that's a
great opportunity for the bank. I mean, we have a leasing capability for the organization that I think will be very –
is being very well received by our C&I customers that typically wasn't available in the legacy Columbia portfolio of
customers.
So, great opportunity to kind of see us be – have a lot of financial strength and to be very active in all the markets
that we are in. And I'm excited about the ability to grow loans. Pipeline looks strong. It's actually just up a little bit
from last quarter, which is nice to see. Demand in the marketplace is certainly not the same as it was six to nine
months ago, but there still is demand. And I think to Clint's point earlier, we've got a great opportunity to take
market share in all the markets that we are in.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then just kind of in that question, too, how are new loan yields and in what segments are you still
expecting to kind of drive that growth and give good risk-adjusted returns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I think it certainly depends on the asset class, but I think they're in the – they're near the 6% range on
yields, maybe a little higher. And, I mean, just we've got a lot of dry powder, a lot of opportunity, and able to serve
our customers and bring in new ones into the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then you guys have done a great job continuing to expand at both Columbia and Umpqua with new
hires and new markets. And you've already touched on Utah. I guess as you look at your footprint and thinking
about new hiring opportunities and the future of the bank, is this a time to be greedy and [ph] tick off (00:37:04)
new talent just given the volatility? Are you looking at new hires? And if you are, is it primarily deepening existing
footprint? I mean, you talked about continuing to invest in the franchise, but are you considering further market
expansion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, this is Tory again. I'll talk about commercial and let Chris talk about consumer of it. We're doing all of those
things. So, we're looking to hire in the markets, the new markets that we've expanded into: Arizona, Colorado,
and Utah recently. We're looking to hire some really talented folks in those markets. We have hired talent. We
have recently hired talent in those markets. We will continue to do that. And then [ph] infill (00:37:42) and the rest
of the company, I mean, we continue to look at talented people and have a philosophy that we're going to bring
talent into this company when we find it.
And we've got a great story to tell there that – you can obviously tell we're very excited about the future of this
company. And when we think about the opportunity that we have and the opportunity that bankers in our markets
have working here, they get very excited. So, we continue to tell the story. We continue to hire people in the
Pacific Northwest, in Northern California, in Southern California, in Idaho. I mean, you name it. We're continuing
to broaden and expand and push the bank forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And, David, what I'd add to that is the states where we have the commercial presence, we're certainly
looking at bringing on the retail. As I mentioned, we'll bring on small business to fill in where those loan production
offices have historically been. And what I would say is that we're also, though, looking at the wealth side of it and
bringing that into the eight states and the areas that we're expanding as well. And I think we've – both companies
have always been opportunistic that when good bankers raise their hands, we're ready for them. And so, I would
say that's still out there. I echo Tory's comments about people are excited. And when you think about the
capabilities that we have and the balance sheet construction, as Ron described, I think there's going to be plenty
of opportunity for that.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, maybe just staying on the track of opportunity, clearly there's been a lot of disruption with Silicon Valley and
First Republic and just in general, some banks that are seeing more weakness, maybe more specifically, do you
see specific opportunities in some of those business areas, some of those markets to step in? And I'm not sure
when you talk about new commercial customers coming to approach you, any of that from some of those
specialty business lines that some of those banks focus on that could be an opportunity for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jared, this is Clint, I'll kick it off and then see if Tory and Chris want to add anything to it. The short answer
is, yes, we have seen opportunities. We saw that actually in the days and hours leading up to Silicon Valley's
failure. We've got a pretty diverse offering and we talk about our portfolio, and you look in the slide deck and you
can see both sides of the balance sheet, there's a lot of granularity and diversification. And so with that, we have
a lot of very experienced bankers and we won't do something if we don't have expertise in it. But there is some
crossover. And to the extent that there's crossover, there's – we'll compete for the business. And I think we
compete very well and it will create opportunities. But in terms of going all in and shifting our focus, that's not
necessarily the plan. We love the diversification that we have. We think that's a foundational element of strength
for our company. But certainly, we'll be opportunistic when and where we can be. Tory, anything to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, I think you've summarized it really well. I mean, there's – and I think there's that – the opportunity exists in all
of our markets and, we're going to stay to do what we do, what we've historically done, and do it exceptionally

well, and continue to find customers or people. Customers who want to be part of the bank or people who want to
be part of the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Good, thanks. And then maybe shifting a little bit on capital, you highlight getting back to that CET1 target
of 9%. Do you think – is that sufficient going forward? Is 9% high enough or do you think that maybe you end up
needing to bring that floor up a little bit before really exploring other capital deployment opportunities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Chris, this is Ron. I'd say, our long-term target on CET1 is 9% and we're at 8.9%, so we'll be there next
month. I'd say in the total risk-based capital ratio long-term, again, target is around 12%, and I expect we'll get
there over the course of the year again through that earnings and accretion, the capital accretion those coming off
the financial benefit of both companies coming together [ph] cutting the costs of having no (00:43:39) accretion.
So, that's really, you got to look across all four ratios both at the parent and the bank. And so yeah, by default
then that CET1 would be above 9%, but long-term target wise, not significantly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So you don't feel a need to change that or raise that in light of sort of the turmoil that we've seen in the last
month.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
In terms of long-term targets, no. There's times where you might want to be below or above, depending on which
way the winds blow. And I said we're going to have quite a bit of capital generation over time and again, so much
of the mark, I mean, $1.6 million of the $1.7 billion in March was rate related like on the bonds, that's for the vast
majority of that is backed by government to government entities. So, it's interesting for you to think about the
impact of the merger accounting on this, reducing our capital ratio today, but then accreting back over time. I'd
say, to CET1, that's a measure I know a lot of analysts and investors focus on, don't forget to look at the other
[ph] issues (00:44:38) as well, though. I mean, in total risk-based capital generally between the bank of the parent
is where I'm targeting to be around 12 over time is a sweet spot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And I think the history of pre-merger both companies that was always a challenge trying to get walk it back down
to those long-term targets. And you add in the accretion income as well as the earnings power after we get the full
cost synergies baked in. It's – that's still, I think, the primary challenge for us is in the coming years is how do we
keep those capital ratios from getting too far north of those targets. And you can pick any ratio. They're all going
to grow pretty rapidly.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Okay. And then, just finally from me, when we look at the average earning asset guide, where – do you see cash
going back down to a – I guess, where do you see cash going as a percentage of the balance sheet after we get
through the end of March here [ph] back down to 5% (00:45:55) below 5%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And on that guide, we make in the note column there, we assume we maintain a elevated level of cash. Of
course, a lot of [ph] ask me (00:46:04) subject to what happens from a macro standpoint with overall deposit
flows, et cetera. So – but, I'd say all else being equal if we brought on $2 billion of additional off balance sheet
liquidity, on balance sheet, just to have it on balance sheet, and we're sitting at [ph] 3 (00:46:19) and we'd be
somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, if we had not done that. So that's probably a better
representation of [ph] we'll not expect that in spring cash flow for the floor at (00:46:27).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I'd just add, we had flexibility and we decided that it was appropriate to use that flexibility and just keep a
little more cash on the balance sheet during the near term.

Jared Shaw Q

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good afternoon. The first one from me just around the borrowings of $6 billion of borrowings and [ph] then $2
billion of it was (00:47:07) for fund cash. But I guess what's your – what are your thoughts on how borrowings
might trend for the balance of the year and whether you might use securities to sell securities to pay them down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Ideally, we're going to see our deposit activities strengthen over the course of the next couple of quarters
post consolidation, as you heard, sorry – post conversion, as you heard Chris and Clint talk about earlier. So no
plans to reduce the investment portfolio. That's very well structured, that's going to provide a lot of value over
time. And that discount will [ph] increase if we keep those now (00:47:41) discounted bonds on the books. So plan
on – maintaining the wholesale borrowings, but then that'll fluctuate just as the opposite of what – we see with the
net loan deposit flows, so in near term, relatively static.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Okay. Great. And then you've had a lot of time with how long the merger took to close to identify the cost saves,
make sure you can get $135 million out. They're coming out sooner than previously thought. But, are there, it may
not necessarily be the focus in the near term, but have you been able to quantify some additional cost saves
above and beyond that $135 million and whether or not if so, how much and, could that hit the bottom line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, this is Clint. We have spoken over the past year that our internal target is, is actually above $135
million. And, if we seem overly confident in delivering on $135 million by the end of the third quarter, it's because
we have, in fact, identified up to that internal target. What we haven't done is we haven't disclosed what that
internal number is. And there's a couple of reasons. One, with inflation and wage pressure that's happened over
the past year-and-a-half, since we set that target. We wanted to maintain flexibility. And then the other component
of that is, is the investment in growing our franchise that Chris and Tory spoke about.
So, we wanted to make sure that we're still going to do those things. We're still going to make the appropriate
investments, but net-net, we want to make sure that that doesn't dilute $135 million or 12.5% cost saves that we
promise to investors. So, there is higher internal target. It's identified. It'll, trickle in fourth quarter and beyond. It
could be diluted somewhat by other investments that we may elect to make. We'll talk about those at the time that
they occur.
But then the other aspect of, we put two pretty large banks together and I think we did a really good job as a team
of setting the org structure for a 50-plus billion dollar bank, but we also know that there's probably areas where
we're not probably, we know there are areas where, yeah, we're a little heavy in terms of people or redundancy.
And I think that's a longer term process of just fine tuning and making our company the best and most efficient it
can be. And so that's the type of activities that you'll see in 2024, 2025 and then ongoing as we go through the
years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just around the deposit pricing outlook. It sounds like you're doing some promotional activities in
some of your newer markets. But can you talk through the deposit pricing philosophy now that you guys are
together? I mean, legacy [ph] Colby (00:51:25) wasn't very promotional when it came to deposits, but obviously
with the combined entity, that may have changed a little bit, and the turmoil in March may have also changed your
view on pricing maybe going forward. Just any comments around deposit pricing outlook and in particular, when
the Fed stops raising rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure, Matt. Great question. And I would say that separately, we actually were very similar in our approaches to
exception pricing and in doing things of that nature. Coming together, yeah, we're still on the same track that we
do have as some promo rates that are out there, that's not just new markets, it's existing markets. It's all across
the footprint. And so that kind of sets the – that sets a marker for us. But we're still negotiating rates with clients
and looking at options, looking at where – what's the real need, what are they really trying to do with the money.
And so as I mentioned previously, lots of different ways to go about that.
The Fed and in the slowing, I think, that's going to maybe you'll see some lag. And I think deposit rates tend to lag
that, and that's historically for both companies as well. So as it approaches the slowing, I think that yeah, you start

maybe getting near the peak of it, but then I'll always throw in the caveat of we don't know what competitors are
going to do. And so we just have to maintain our discipline. We have to stay in touch with our clients and
understand what's going on in the market. And then Tory, if you want to add anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, the only I would add is that with all the conversations that we're having with clients, which is a lot
which has been great, the conversation is less about price and more about security and safety. Certainly, there's
some price in the conversation, but a lot of it's around security and safety and explain the balance sheet of the
company and our earnings stream and our deposit base, et cetera, it's like very valuable to the customer, our
customer base. And then we had, as Chris, I think, talked about in his comments, we have a couple products that
are really valuable to kind of take money and create incredible safety and security around it through our ICS
product procedures. And so we've done that on a lot the last couple months, I think we probably increased the
ICS bounces about $400 million to $500 million, which is just reciprocal insurance for deposits especially on the
commercial side. So, I mean, we've got a lot of options for customers and had a lot of conversations. And again,
it's a little less about price and more about a relationship and about safety and security.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Clarification on the margin guidance, I think you noted the margin was 4.31% on a GAAP basis in March. I think
the borrowings were about the access cash and borrowings are up 10 basis points to that in your full year margin
guidance that 4.15% to 4.25%, what do you assume for borrowing and cash, can you assume it stays at a
relatively similar level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We assume a consistent level and also recognize that that full year number will also reflect the effect of
averages with the combination fully included for 10 of those 12 months, but not the full 12. So maintain consistent
cash balances. And then, I'd clarify one item. So when we talked about the impact of the excess liquidity, I was
really referring to the month of March at the [ph] 355 would have been ballpark 365 having not brought (00:55:34)
on that excess borrowing, but, [ph] insignificant impact (00:55:40) in terms of net interest income but 10 bps on
the margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Got it. Understood. Okay. And on the core fee income side, it looks like when I adjust the items called out
that the core operating fee income was around $47 million or so for the quarter, I guess, given there's several
moving parts here, can you help us out just expectations for kind of a core fee income run rate moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We didn't provide a guide on that. But I can tell you for the month of March net interest income excluding
again the fair value change type stuff was $22 million just for the month on a combined basis.

And last one from me is just on the office. I appreciate all the color here on page 26 of the presentation. A couple
of questions for the six properties that are listed as greater than $30 million, what markets are those in? And can
you talk about the underwriting specifically on the larger end of the spectrum and whether it differs at all from what
you list as the kind of averages there? And then, the second part was the credit mark taken on acquired office
portfolio. Is that similar to the overall credit mark in a transaction? Or did the deal allow you to put a greater kind
of mark against the office book?

Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Frank, Chief Credit Officer. Regarding the first part of your question, the majority of those in the
larger tranche are really centered in the Puget Sound area, if you will. And the underwriting is very similar but the
qualification criteria, I would say, is much more steep. So we've got to know the sponsors extremely well. They've
got to sensitize extremely well. We shock it for rate, we shock it for vacancy even to a greater degree of some of
our smaller relationship deals that we evaluate. So they are all leased at this point, I will say, fully leased under
lease agreements and are performing well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the credit mark on the office portfolio, specifically, was it similar to just the overall market, was
there a bifurcation? I guess did the deal allow you to put a larger credit mark on the office book?
A – [05DWXV-E Ron Farnsworth]>: But we have the ability to do if the data supports it. But again we talked about
the quality of this portfolio, I'd say it's ballpark, in average, in line with the overall CRE level.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good evening, everyone, or good afternoon for you all. Thank you for taking the questions. Just wanted to
ask, on the securities that you sold and then the securities that you purchased at the end of March, what was the
duration of those securities and what was the rate on the $1.2 billion that you sold, I guess more the effective rate
for the marks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Ron. I'd say – so again we sold off [ph] front-ended (00:59:31) cash flows. So the duration on the
purchases was probably about a half year longer than the overall duration. Again, we wanted to extend that, so
we would have been probably around 5.5, ended up at 5.7 just with the effect of – the repurchases were longer
dated, right, so and – and again with an eye towards – when we did this, it was actually the first week of March,

right? So you had a top tick in the bond yield February 28, in that first week, and it wasn't for another week, a
week and a half or so following that you saw the rally in the bond markets and the yields decline. So, overall, the
mark book was – now you talked about 4.5%, the ones sold were probably a bit below; the ones purchased were
a bit above just given the slight difference in duration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And then on the NIM guide, the core NIM guide that you have, I just wanted to ask, you
outlined what your rate expectations are but I wanted to ask what the interest-bearing beta and the NIB mix
assumptions are that underpin that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
You bet. It'll be a continued – we'll be talking about later in the interest rate sensitivity slides working up closer to
that model beta from our sensitivity standpoint. So higher than 28% but probably – but not at the 53% level we
have footnoted on that slide later on. So continued increase just because we're assuming there's a lag to deposit
pricing increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And is there a static deposit mix assumption that underpins the NIM guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's relatively static granted, and we talked about earlier, for example, DDA are up here in December – sorry, here
in April, but just in terms of the overall mix, not a significant change in the overall mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then on the – I guess on the margin waterfall chart that you have in there, the 43-basis-point drag that
you have for deposits, do you have a sense for how much of that was mix versus rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I think in terms of this waterfall, you've also got the effect of the Q4 reported amount was standalone
Umpqua Holdings, the Q1 reported amount was combined company for one month, and then standalone prior
Umpqua Holdings for the first two months of the quarter. So you've got that really drive a good chunk of that from
an overall mix standpoint...

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to ask on the loans that are maturing in the less than six months bucket, the fixed, the $2.6
billion, do you have a sense for what the current yield is on those loans versus what current origination yields are?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
...those loans are going to be dated from prior to the move up. So it's going to be in the, call it, mid-4s to 5% range
at the highest, which is going to be well below what Tory talked about earlier for new loan yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And do you all have any hedges in place on the loan portfolio that we need to think about for NII modeling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Not on the balance sheet. We do have customer swaps, but those are offsetting back-to-back on our balance
sheet. We've taken the approach of using instruments within the portfolio. Specifically here, in this case, we're
talking about the bond portfolio along with the use of short-term borrowings to really help improve our interest rate
sensitivity position we talked about earlier.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then just one last one for me, I'm sorry if you mentioned this earlier and I missed it, but just on the
FinPac portfolio, I wanted to ask two questions. What is the growth outlook for that portfolio going forward? I know
it's a much smaller piece of the overall loan portfolio now. And then the 3.89% annualized charge-off ratio, I know
it's tough to say but could you help us think about what a peak net charge-off ratio kind of looks like through cycle
for that loan book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
This is Tory. I'll talk about the growth side and then Frank can weigh in if he wants on the charge-off piece. I mean
the – first of all, the FinPac portfolio is three different businesses. It's a small ticket, which makes up about half of
it, and then we have a vendor space and a traditional commercial bank leasing business for our customers. Each
of those are about 25% of the portfolio.
The growth outlook for the combined FinPac portfolio is somewhere between $50 million and $100 million over
the course of 2023, and that's evenly distributed within those three businesses. So moving up a little but nothing
significant at all. Frank, do you want to talk about...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Generally, what we find within the FinPac portfolio, we look at the non-accrual numbers and how those are
tracking. And generally, of the preceding quarter, approximately 80% of those non-accruals typically roll the
charge-off. I think that the top of it will be north of 4% and I would be surprised if it peaks over 5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. And I guess just if I could sneak one follow-up on that, do you view the FinPac portfolio
as – I guess when you look across the rest of the equivalent finance kind of space, do you view it as different from
a mix and the type of stuff that you're underwriting relative to what other banks underwrite, or do you think it's
fairly similar to the equipment loans that other banks are also underwriting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's different. With respect to the classic FinPac, these are tiny ticket loans, they're higher yielding, they're higher
risk specialized lending. So that's why you see the loss numbers where they're at and that's why we're not
surprised. Typically, when you say equipment finance company, most equipment finance companies do not have
a tiny ticket, small ticket leasing operation. They're typically middle market, which we also have, and those losses
are extremely low, if existent at all, but it's also extremely low-yielding business as well. So it is more of a
specialized leasing business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes, this is Tory...

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Just one question for me. And I know a lot has changed since the merger was announced, but with the return on
tangible common equity of 15%, it was kind of the estimation NIM, but should we think about that as a long-term
target for the company now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I say this – we did also include on page 4 of this, kind of our updated expectations as compared to the
original announcement date. And with that, just in terms of return on tangible common equity, driven again by a lot
of the accretion, 15% is now 20%-plus. So I guess it depends on long term and the definition of long term for that.
For the next couple years, we feel pretty good about that. Longer-term, beyond that, I think just going back over
27-year career, not specific to Columbia but just for regional banks in general, somewhere in the mid-teens seem
to make sense for long-term targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A

Hey, Jon.
[indiscernible] (01:08:07)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just – hey. Just a few follow-ups. Just focusing out a bit on credit, I understand the Moody's impact on the
provision, but credit seems clean, you have high reserves and marks. Is it safe for us to assume just minimal
provisions from here, or what would drive your provision from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
This is Ron. What I'd say – what would drive the provision, of course, will be changes in the economic forecasts,
right? So as those change, you'll see from a CECL standpoint, provisions, but the real key is what's happening
with charge-offs. And so we've seen elevated levels with FinPac over the last couple quarters specific to that
small owner-operator transportation type business. That will continue here for a bit. And we're just – we're not
seeing any migration for the rest of the portfolio, which is the vast majority of the portfolio. So I think specific
provisions, it's going to be solely based off of what we see with the Moody's baseline economic forecast or
consensus economic forecast over time, how they change.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's good, that's helpful. Just one follow-up on office, that last bullet where you give some of the stats in
terms of what you've seen in that portfolio, is any of that abnormal in your minds? The central business district
and suburban office that you're talking about, are any of those stats different from what you normally see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, they're not. Pretty typical as to what I would have expected to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then I guess the other one, slide 10, I want to make sure I have this right. The earning asset
message, Ron, when I just do the math, it suggests that Q3 and Q4 average earning assets are going to look a lot
like Q2. Is that the right way to read that? I know it sounds like a simple question but I just want to clarify that.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then last one, Clint, for you, are the name changes done and just big picture, how did the
conversion go? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The name changes are done. The reason I hesitate is – so like if you drive by the, like a legacy, a former
Columbia Bank branch, most of those are – signs are bagged right now because there's 150 locations that we
have to re-sign. And then even in markets like the Puget Sound area where we both had – or Portland where we
both separately had a significant presence, well, we want to make sure that the branding in that market and any
particular matches. We don't want to mismatch signs and things.
So that's a summertime project. But when you do drive by one of the locations that formerly said Columbia Bank,
it now says Umpqua Bank. Our branch that's in the first floor of our headquarters building here has been fully
rebranded, was done I think the first week. So that side of it I think has gone very well. What I'll say about the
conversion, when Ron was talking about the bond portfolio during his prepared remarks, he could hardly contain
his excitement, and even right now, I just mentioned bond portfolio and he's really ear to ear. That's kind of how –
I'm not an excitable person but that's how when I think about the team that we have assembled with this
combination.
And I referenced it in my prepared remarks, and this has been a pretty lengthy call so I don't know if anybody
even remembers an hour and 10 minutes ago when I made these comments, but if you think about what we
accomplished organizationally in the first quarter, two separate divestiture projects, I mean those are kind of mini-
M&A transactions in and of themselves; closing a transformative merger mid-quarter; and then having this level of
detail already to go. And along the way, two and a half weeks after you close it, you convert the systems, and so I
think about the talent that it took to pull that off, and we did it.
And so I think about myself as an employee of the company, I'm utilizing all our current go-forward platforms. It's
working great. It'd be disingenuous if I didn't say that the first day after my email converted that I wasn't like trying
to figure out where the heck everything was. But by the third day, man, I was loving the enhanced functionality
that we have. And then if I step back and think of it from a customer's perspective, on a personal level, utilizing all
of our go-forward platforms and they're working great. And more importantly, when I go home at night, my wife's
not complaining about Zelle or the mobile banking app or anything like that.
So just a couple of kind of high-level points of view that we've monitored. And then we've had a lot of
conversations with some of our very complex, larger middle market clients and just a lot of success stories. So I
think I was telling somebody this the other day, our IMO team, they gave themselves in A-minus. I give them a
solid A, maybe even an A-plus. Now, that doesn't mean there still aren't just some things that are in flight, but
overall, it went great and that's why there's the optimism around the pipelines building, the outlook for the rest of
the year, the ability to go out, take market share and all of those things that we've talked about for the last hour
and 15 minutes.
