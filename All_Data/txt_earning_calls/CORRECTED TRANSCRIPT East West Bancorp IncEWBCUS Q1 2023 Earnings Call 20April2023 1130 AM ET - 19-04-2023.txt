Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Diana. Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the review
of our financial results on slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter 2023 net income of
$322 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.27. Excluding an impairment loss on subordinated debt security
of a failed bank, which was $7 million after tax, adjusted net income was $329.5 million in the first quarter, and
adjusted earnings per share were $2.32. Adjusted earnings per share increased 40% year-over-year. Our
profitability is industry leading. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted returns were 2.05% on average assets,
and 23% on average tangible common equity. First quarter pre-tax pre-provision profitability was 2.9%.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our branch – of our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, total loans reached a
record $48.9 billion, an increase of $697 million, or 1% from December 31. First quarter average loan growth was
likewise 1%. Average growth in residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans was partially offset by a
modest decrease in average commercial and industrial loans.
Total deposits were $54.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.2 billion or 2% from December 31. First
quarter average deposits were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, time deposits
grew due to successful branch based Lunar New Year CD campaign. This was offset by declines in other deposit
categories, which reflected customers seeking higher use in a rising interest rate environment, and banking
industry disruption in mid-March. Deposit growth is well diversified by deposit type, and 33% of total deposits
were in non-interest bearing demand accounts as of March 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 89% as of
March 31.
Turning to slide 5. As shown in the exhibits on this slide, all of our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter.
As of March 31, we had a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.6%, up 38 basis points quarter-over-quarter; a total
capital ratio of 14.5%, up 50 basis point quarter-over-quarter; and a tangible common equity ratio of 8.74%, up 8
basis point quarter-over-quarter. Those capital ratios are some of the highest among regional banks. Also on this
slide are pro forma capital calculations as of March 31, 2023.
The key takeaway is that our capital is very strong. In the slide we provided pro forma capital ratios, adjusting for
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity security marks that are not already included in the capital ratios, and also
for on and off balance sheet allowance not already included in the capital ratios.
Over the quarter, our book value per share grew 5% and our tangible book value per share increased 6%,
whereas Board of Directors has declared second quarter 2023 dividend for the company's common stock. The
quarterly common dividend of $0.48 will be payable on May 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on May 1, 2023.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. As of March 31, 2023, C&I loans
outstanding were $15.6 billion, down only $69 million or 0.4% from prior quarter end, and up 5% year-over-year.
As shown on this slide, our C&I portfolio continues to be well diversified by industry and sector. Greater China
loans increased 1% linked quarter to $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2023.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Slide 7 and 8 show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well diversified by geography and
property type, and consists of low loan-to-value loans. Total commercial real estate loans were $19.4 billion as of
March 31, 2023, up 2% from December 31, and up 14% year-over-year. The quality of our loan portfolio remains
very strong. However, given the attention on CRE, we have added more details about our office and retail
commercial real estate loans on slide 9 and slide 10.
You can see on slide 9, our office commercial real estate portfolio is very granular with few large loans. We have
only seven loans totaling $271 million that are greater than $30 million in size. The weighted average loan-to-
value of our office commercial real estate portfolio is a low 52%, and the loan-to-value is consistently low across
loan size segments. Portfolio is well-diversified by geography with limited exposure to downtown and central
business district areas.
Slide 10, you can see that our retail commercial real estate portfolio is also very granular with few large loans. We
have only seven loans totaling $268 million, which are greater than $30 million in size. The weighted average loan
to value of our retail commercial real estate portfolio is a low 48%, and the loan-to-value is also consistently low
across loan size segments. The portfolio is well-diversified by geographies, and the footprint largely reflect our
branch network.
In slide 11, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Our residential mortgage loans are primarily originated through our
branch network. I would highlight that 82% of our key loan commitments were in a first lien position as of March
31, 2023. Residential mortgage loans totaled $13.8 billion as of March 31, up 3% from December 31, and up 19%
year-over-year. We added a new slide to provide more information about our granular, diversified deposit base.
Slide 12 illustrates our deposit mix by segment and also industries for commercial deposits. Deposits totaled
$54.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of 2% quarter-over-quarter, and less than 0.5% year-over-year.
Now, over 550,000 deposit accounts at East West. And our average commercial deposit account size is
approximately $375,000. And our retail branch base consumer deposit, which totaled 33% of our deposit, have an
average size of approximately $40,000.
Commercial deposits are well-diversified by industry. Our largest commercial deposit industry segment at 7% is
real estate property investments and management. These deposits are predominantly thousands of operating
accounts for individual properties that are commercial real estate customers only. As of March 31, out of our
$52.5 billion in domestic deposit, insured or otherwise collateralized deposits were $29.6 billion, and the domestic
uninsured deposit ratio improved to 44%, down from 50% as of December 31, 2022. There's an industry
disruption in mid-March. Our associates have worked with customers to expand the FDIC insurance coverage,
primarily through the utilization of fully insured sweep programs. And as of yesterday, April 19, 2023, the domestic
uninsured deposit ratios improved to 41%.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our securities portfolio, liquidity
management, asset quality and income statement. Irene?

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with a discussion of our securities portfolio and liquidity management strategy on
slide 13. On March 31, our securities available-for-sale or AFS had a fair value of $6.3 billion, with the weighted
average spot yield of 3.25% on a duration of approximately four years. We purchased few AFS securities in the
first quarter. Gross unrealized losses on this portfolio were 11% of amortized costs as of March 31, already

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
reflected in tangible common equity as part of AOCI. March 31, our securities held-to-maturity or HTM had an
amortized cost of $3 billion and a weighted average spot yield of 1.73% with a duration of approximately eight
years. We have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity.
Gross unrealized losses on our HTM securities were 16% of amortized cost as of March 31. At the time of the
transfer of these securities from AFS to HTM in the first quarter of [ph] 2022 (00:13:26), $138 million of the
unrealized losses were included in AOCI and are reflected in equity. As the remainder of the unrealized losses on
HTM were to be treated similarly to AFS, our tangible common equity would still be a very strong 8.37% as of
March 31.
We took many actions in response to the recent banking industry disruption. First, we increased our on balance
sheet liquidity, our cash and cash equivalents increased 70% to $5.9 billion as of March 31, up from $3.5 billion
as of December 31. This increase was primarily funded with $4.5 billion borrowings with the Bank Term Funding
Program at a cost of 4.37%. Thus, the on balance sheet liquidity has provided a positive carry and contribution to
NII.
Also, we swiftly added to our borrowing capacity by pledging additional assets with the Federal Reserve and at
FHLB, San Francisco. Our total borrowing capacity plus cash and cash equivalents were $30.6 billion as of March
31, equivalent to 134% of our total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. We have a longstanding approach to
conservative liquidity management at East West as an important component of our risk management practices.
Moving on to asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on slides 14 and 15. The
asset quality of our loan portfolio continues to be strong. Non-performing assets as of March 31 decreased to $93
million, a 14 basis points of total assets, an improvement from $100 million or 16 basis points as of December 31.
Quarter-over-quarter, criticized loans increased 2% and the criticized loan ratio increased 1 basis point. Our
allowance for loan losses increased to $620 million as of March 31, or 1.27% of loans, up from 1.24% as of year-
end.
During the first quarter, we recorded net charge-offs of $609,000 or 1 basis point of average loans, annualized,
compared with net charge-offs of 8 basis points, annualized, in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the stability of our
asset quality metrics, our low charge-offs and the current macroeconomic forecast, we recorded a provision for
credit losses of $20 million in the first quarter, compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter last year.
Again, while asset quality remains strong and the current credit environment is benign, we continue to remain
vigilant. We are actively monitoring the loan portfolio and taking proactive measures to build our allowance for
loan losses. We are performing ongoing deep dives into loan portfolio segments, for example, by commercial real
estate property type and maturity year. We are showing up loans when appropriate by security, additional
collateral guarantees or pay downs from our borrowers.
And now, moving on to a discussion of our income statement on slide 16. As Dominic mentioned, this quarter, we
had a non-GAAP adjustment to our EPS of $0.05. Also early in the year, we prepaid $300 million of repo liabilities
that carried a weighted average interest rate of 6.74%. Amortization of tax credits and other investments in the
first quarter was $10 million, compared with $65 million in the fourth quarter. Variability in this line reflects timing
when tax credit investments close.
For the second quarter of 2023, we are currently estimating that the amortization of tax credit investments will be
approximately $25 million. The first quarter effective tax rate was 23%, compared with 20% for the 2022 full year.
We currently anticipate that the effective tax rate for the full year of 2023 will also be 20%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 17 through 20, starting
with the average balance. First quarter average loan growth was 1%, and first quarter average earning assets
growth was 2%, reflecting the growth in loans and cash. Average deposits of $55 billion were essentially
unchanged quarter-over-quarter, reflecting growth of $3 billion in CDs, offset by declines in other deposit
accounts. Declines in other deposit categories reflected ongoing customer preferences for higher yields as well as
the banking industry disruption in mid-March. Our average loan to deposit ratio was 88% in the first quarter, and
average non-interest-bearing demand deposits made up 36% of average deposits.
Turning to slide 18. First quarter 2023, net interest income was $600 million, a decrease of 1% from the fourth
quarter due to day count. Net interest margin of 3.96% compressed by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
Equalizing for day count, the 2% quarter-over-quarter average earning asset growth more than offsets the 2 basis
points of NIM contraction. Also, as you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide, NIM compression in the first
quarter reflected the impact of higher interest bearing funding costs and the funding mix shift, partially offset by
expanding asset yields. In April, we added $500 million notional value, received tax swap to augment the $3.25
billion of swaps and collars we added in 2022 to help preserve net interest income when they decrease. This
impact was about 8 basis points to NIM this quarter. NIM would have been 4.04% otherwise.
Turning to slide 19. The first quarter average loan yield was 6.14%, an increase of 55 basis points quarter-over-
quarter. As of March 31, the spot coupon rate on our loans was 6.21% compared with 5.92% as of year-end. In
the slide, we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five quarter-ends. You'll
see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio [indiscernible] (00:20:07). In total, 61% of our
loan portfolio was variable rate as of March 31, including 28% linked to prime rate and 27% linked to SOFR or
LIBOR rates.
I'd also highlight that for our CRE loan customers, we have helped many of them hedge against rising rates
through the use of swaps, caps and collars. Fixed rate and synthetically fixed rate loans through the utilization of
these derivatives are 65% of the total CRE book as of March 31, while East West enjoys a benefit of asset
sensitivity today, the majority of our CRE customers are protected against rising debt service costs in a higher
rate environment.
Turning to slide 20, our average cost of deposits for the first quarter was 160 basis points, up 54 basis points from
the fourth quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 193 basis points as of March 31, equivalent to 39%
cumulative beta relative to the 475 basis point increase in the target Fed funds rate since December 2021. In
comparison, the cumulative beta on our loans has been 58% over the same time period.
Moving on to fee income on slide 21. Total non-interest income in the first quarter was $60 million. Excluding the
impairment of the aforementioned security, adjusted non-interest income in the first quarter was $70 million, up
from $65 million in the prior quarter.
Slide 22 first quarter non-interest expense was $218 million. Excluding amortization of tax credit and CDI and
debt extinguishment costs on the repo, adjusted non-interest expense was $204 million in the first quarter, up 6%
sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal first quarter increases in comp and employee benefit expense. The first
quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 30% compared with 29% in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax pre-
provision income was $466 million in the first quarter, and our pre-tax pre-provision return on assets was an
industry leading 2.90%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Next, outlook on slide 23. For the full year of 2023 compared to full year of 2022, we currently expect year-over-
year loan growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year, and net interest income growth in the range of 16% to
18%. Underpinning our net interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of March 31, 2023.
Adjusted non-interest expense growth in the range of 8% to 9%. We expect our revenue and expense outlook to
result in positive operating leverage.
In terms of credit, for the full year of 2023, we expect to record a provision for credit losses in the range of $100
million to $120 million. The provision for credit losses for 2023 will largely be driven by change in the
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth. Today, asset quality is excellent, and we believe that the potential
losses from any problem loans are limited.
Finally, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 20%, based on about $150
million of tax credit investments for the year, excluding low income housing tax credits and an estimated related
tax credit amortization of approximately $145 million for the full year. There will be quarterly variability in the tax
rate and the tax credit amortization due to the timing of tax credit investments placed into service.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Dominic Ng

Thank you, Irene. In closing, East West has a sound business model and healthy balance sheet. This reflected in
our granular deposit base and our diversified loan portfolio with strong asset quality. We operate with high capital
ratios and we are well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth and industry leading profitability, despite the
headwinds facing the banking industry.
In 2023, our outlook is for attractive revenue growth and well controlled efficiency. I wish to thank all our
associates without whom our success would not be possible. For over 50 years, our associates have strived to
help our customers succeed and East West's strong results are reflection of their hard work and dedication.
I will now open up the call to questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of
America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. I guess just one big picture question, Dominic. Clearly, I think, given what happened in March, I think the
question is, are business commercial deposit customers a lot more sensitive around how they manage their
excess funds or uninsured deposits, whichever way you want to look at it? Has any of this changed in terms of
how you strategically think about gathering deposits and what type of deposits you want on the balance sheet and
how this may influence growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, it really hasn't changed too much, because we have always have a very strict principle in terms of we got to
run our balance sheet in a very prudent, conservative way, and then no concentration in any particular industry,
no concentration on any particular one single client and so forth. So, you can see, despite the turmoil, well, we
down 2%. After two weeks of chaos, the deposit down 2%. So, it's very different than the banks that may have a
very, very high exposure, and then [indiscernible] (00:27:28) customer base.
So, our position is that so long that you don't have overconcentration in any one particular client, then you will not
be taking a very, very big hit one way or the other. Now, obviously, if you look at for what happened after the last
two weeks in March, customers' behavior changed and particularly, if you look at in the private equity sector or VC
sector, the limited partners who may not be as familiar with the banks would probably talk to their general partner
and they asked out, hey, you know what, it is not a [indiscernible] (00:28:10) bank, maybe just not [indiscernible]
(00:28:14). They would rather take the money to some other – treasury or some other sources just to make sure
that they are parking their money in a safe place when they have no ability to figure out how the bank's financial
performance are and so forth.
Again, these are limited partners who do not have direct exposure interaction with the banks. So, for those type of
customers, there are two ways to handle it. One is that we provide additional financial information, just like – we
show our capital ratio. We show the borrowing capacity, which is 130-some-odd-percent higher than the
8

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
uninsured deposits. And we show the granular deposit base, consumer, commercial, 550,000 accounts, smaller
balance, all of that that we show to them. And then, we can somewhat help convince even folks who have no
exposure with East West Bank and they can get comfortable. And that's one way.
The other way is the fully insured program like ICS and CDARS. I mean, for convenience, it takes some time to
sign them up for ICS [indiscernible] (00:29:31). So, they are now 100% insured. They don't have to worry. And so,
we do combination multiple different ways, because for a long term, we wanted to continue to have more people
to understand who East West are.
And then, also through this kind of interaction, actually, we are now getting more referrals, more deposit
customers, limited partners that normally don't have anything to do with us. Because of this changing
environment, we need to reach out and after reaching out, they say, oh, maybe we should start banking at East
West. So, it's all worked out just fine in the moment. And so, I encourage our team to do that.
But on the other hand, we also want to make sure to expedite some of these customers' concern and I would just
provide them to a fully insured program. This is combination of both. So I think that part of the change is
happening and, obviously, at this point, a bit more [indiscernible] (00:30:34). We still – I do feel that not having
overconcentration in any particular segment [indiscernible] (00:30:42). As you are well aware, we have like a VC
deposit that's less than 2%. Our PE deposit also very low. So, from that standpoint, so even with these kind of like
Silicon Valley Bank's [indiscernible] (00:30:59), it doesn't hurt us like the way maybe to the other banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just a separate question around commercial real estate, means it's less about your portfolio. You
provided a great amount of detail, but in a – one, do you share the concerns in the market around the outlook for
commercial real estate, the impact from interest rates, office CRE, but maybe that could spread depending on the
recession? Just how concerned are you in terms of the overall market backdrop for CRE over the next year or
two? And how do you insulate these two as from just the market factors that could lead to a decline in loan to
values, maybe more defaults not at East West, but it could have some secondary effects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, just at this point, it all depends on the interest rate environment. So, I would think that as the economies
continue to slow down, at some point, the Fed is going to have to drop rate. Once they saw drop in rate,
depending on the pace of how fast they drop rate, that would affect relief to the CRE market. Obviously, we all
know that there are a bunch of commercial real estate out there, and there are a lot of them may be coming due
and some of them have higher LTV, some of them are in areas that have much higher exposure.
But by and large, if you look at the small properties that are not in that highly concentrated, like downtown,
metropolitan area in certain particular cities, they – those properties are going pretty well, because business
overall is not doing badly. So, people still need to have an office, if you need to – by the way, commercial real
estate is not just office buildings. We have a lot of retail business going pretty well. And there are warehouses.
Customers still having a hard time to find warehouse space. And there are also multifamily buildings that in many
of the areas in United States have fully occupied.
So, there are a lot of commercial real estate that's still going very well. And for East West Bank, fortunately, we
have many of those. So, how the market would affect us? So, we always prepare for the worst. So, that's why,
few years ago, several years ago, we already started doing a complete scrubbing of our commercial real estate
9

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
portfolio, again slicing and dicing to make sure that we do not have any overconcentration, any particular area,
particular sector – segment within a geographic area that we are concerned, and making sure we do not have too
many very large commercial real estate loans, we do not have any huge one [indiscernible] (00:34:04). And doing
all those typical banking 101 type of risk oversight. And in addition to that, very, very proactively helping our
customers to get interest rate swap.
So that, while we are enjoying adjustable rate in the last year or so and that's even now enjoying just wide margin,
net interest margin, our customers actually paying fixed rate. So we've been very, very proactive active for the last
actually 8 to 9 years doing interest rate swap. And I think that we do have a portfolio that, quite frankly, are much
more immune against the high rate attacks for commercial real estate borrowers.
Secondly, as I looked at the current interest rate environment, we looked at predominantly 2023 [indiscernible]
(00:35:10) 2023. And also the full year 2024 probably would be a more stressful year for the CRE owners. And
when I look at our portfolio, I believe that we only have 6% of our CRE loans coming due in 2023. And, Irene, you
correct me if I'm wrong, I think next year will be 8%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's correct, Dominic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, 6% this year, 8% next year. We are in a much better position in terms of not having to deal with a lot of
those big loans coming due. First of all, we don't have any big loans coming due. Secondly, even with the whole
portfolio, it's only 6% coming due. And next year, we'll have 8% coming due. We have very, very low loan-to-
value, and then many of our customers are in personal guarantee.
And so, while we are working with some of these customers, most of them, they have so much debt service
coverage ratio, even when the rates revised to a new rate for refi, it's not that big an issue. But for those
properties that we think that may potentially be get a little bit more stressful when it comes to – with a high rate,
we work with them to make sure they have at least 34 months, 36 months of additional interest reserve or maybe
making some of the additional down payment. When you have customers have a high liquidity, when you have
customers have personal guarantee, it just makes it so much easier to start that conversation and get that taken
care of. And that's why we're so far working in a very orderly manner. We don't have enough for us to even get
too overexcited about it, but we continue to work with our customers and one at a time. And so far, it's been
working out very well. So, I think, overall that if we can get through next two years and most likely, the
environment will get better.
So, from that standpoint, I would say that, yes, no matter how much we keep it in a safe and sound manner,
there's always going to be outside factors that can affect the market as a whole that would also potentially impact
us negatively. However, we always prepared for the worst to make sure we be proactive and do everything
upfront and just stay ahead of the industry, maybe by several steps, so that we do not get caught like sometimes
– November this year or maybe June of 2024, knowing this may be coming and expect the worst and, eventually,
getting the best out of it.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Just thinking about longer term expectations regarding balance sheet management. As I think
Irene noted, the cash balance is quite a bit higher as a percentage of the balance sheet than they were at 12/31,
and understandably so. How do you think about kind of a more permanent shift, whether it's cash balances or do
you grow high quality liquid assets in the securities portfolio over time to increase at some more permanently
elevated level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Great question. There's no question, given kind of the market disruption, this is something we're evaluating. I think
we try to be prudent with this, Gary. And in the current situation, this is one of the reasons why we have
borrowings, and we kept the cash balances high, [indiscernible] (00:39:03) like $4.5 billion aside from the other
cash we have elsewhere. So, in the near term, I would say probably, given the market disruption that happened
not that far in the past, we'll keep that higher. We'll continue to evaluate as far as securities and other HQLA that
we need.

Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I want to add just briefly with Irene's comment here is that we just kind of like a disruptive market. We wanted to
be excessively prudent, and that's why we went ahead and increased the cash balances and cash equivalent and
then also went ahead and borrowed from the Fed. We don't have to do it. We did it anyway, because we can
afford to do it. With our current balance sheet, with our capital ratios, with our profitability and our return of equity
and whatnot, we're in a position that we can afford to be a bit excessive in terms of making sure that
[indiscernible] (00:40:15) a very, very small balance sheet because, ultimately, that's what matters to our
customers.
When you look at the anxiety going on in the market back in late March, when all these news media putting out
news about regional banks, are they all in trouble? No, quite not. We do need to make sure that we demonstrate
to our customers and that East West is the last thing they need to worry about. And so, if that means that we even
show up more borrowing capacity, why not? Right. And then, that's something that we've done it and so far, so
good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. Thank you. And then, follow-up with regard to loan growth, not shocking, I guess, that you lowered the loan
growth outlook for the year, just given the economic uncertainty, et cetera. Obviously, C&I was lower in the first
quarter, but it's a real seasonality for you. Could you talk about kind of where you think the contributions to loan
growth come over the remainder of the year? Is it kind of specialized verticals? Is it single family, kind of, where's
that growth coming from?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point, I think our thought about this 5% to 7% loan growth guidance is that we just look at the current
economy, and we feel that the direction of this economy is that we may be continue to see our commercial clients
paying down their loans. So, we saw – we actually brought in a lot of new customers. We just have a lot of
existing customer pay down their lines, which I understand, because in this sort of like uncertain environment,
they're not making aggressive investments. They are not – I mean, they're not looking into aggressively
expanding or acquiring any companies and so forth. So, why pay this high interest rate? And so many of them are
paying down the loans. That's why we see C&I to actually slow down a bit, not because we were able to gain new
customers. It's really coming down to most of our customers in general just staying put.
And CRE, we don't expect much growth, because we just – I just talked about it. With this kind of environment,
there's not a lot of deals that make sense. If you have a lot of other customers from other banks who want to
come to us for refinance, it's not going to be that easy to pass the entry level test from East West. So, therefore,
we're not expecting much growth at all.
And the only one that we see so far still carry some decent momentum is on the single family mortgages. And so
far so good. We're still chugging along and our niche product and continue to attract customers, very low loan-to-
value [indiscernible] (00:43:34) the convenience on East West Bank. And then, so we are still generating decent
amount of growth so far. So we see, I think at this point that's what we expect that the growth will be, and we'll
continue to watch the market and see how it goes. And I look at it as at some point, latter part of next year, what
this changes in the banking landscape – I would expect that there may be some more opportunities for us to bring
even more customers organic.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Maybe, Irene, a question on the strategy you're doing with the margin. How should we think
about just the level of downside protection into – over the medium term, given what you've been doing to reduce
asset sensitivity, if the forward curve plays out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think in the medium term, we don't see that much variability. Quite candidly, with the NIM in particular, I
think the largest variability is really going to come with the market pricing on the deposits. I think some of the
hedging strategies, the balance sheet strategies, we're planning for 2024 and beyond, quite honestly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe, Dominic, for you, you have – you've just accumulated a ton of capital over the years. Are
you seeing an opportunity over the next maybe 6 to 18 months to do something opportunistic or on the offensive?
I mean, is there – are you seeing stress in your markets with some of your peers that might avail an opportunity? I
presume buybacks aren't a priority right now, but just trying to think how this capital could be put to work for your
shareholders. Thanks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, well, good question. We're always trying to be opportunistic. We are – we have a culture of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Optimistic and opportunistic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, optimistic. Right now, the market not very optimistic. But then, yeah, we're always trying to be opportunistic
and whenever there is a great deal, then I think that will be very, very positive for our shareholders, we always
strike. But on the other hand, we're very prudent, because we'll never – we're never the kind that just jump into
the playground and want to be the – we just want to be the positive party and then end up getting burned, and
that's just something won't happen at East West.
So, I do feel that maybe in the next 12 to 24 months probably have more opportunity than let's say the last few
years. But just because [indiscernible] (00:46:43) more opportunity, that's just a logical thinking whether that
would be something coming up in our pipe or not. I think I do want to point out is that, you have always seen and
there were many question asked before about why we didn't buy back when we have high capital. As we – this
call will be a good sort of reflection, because we aren't prepared for just crazy thing like Silicon Valley Bank,
Signature Bank just disappearing [indiscernible] (00:47:16) that kind of scenario.
And if we did not have a capital ratio at this level or if we have overconcentration of customer base in one
particular or two particular sectors, we may be hurting in a similar way like a few other banks that they are
experiencing right now. So, we always look at it as a balancing act. The balancing act is that, ROE performing at
one of the top performing level that we can look at ourselves and say that, hey, we done good for the
shareholders. Therefore, maybe we don't need to do too much, but sort of like, further pushing. And this is what I
always reflect on, with us over 20% return of equity, over 2% of ROA, I look at the regional banks around and
then compare them with us. I said, wow, we're pretty good. S&P just gave us the number one best performing
bank ranking last month. So, I look at it as we're doing pretty good right now. Let's not overstretch ourselves and
get way ahead of the pack.
So that's [indiscernible] (00:48:42) as you heard from Irene, as we put up $3.75 billion of these swap and collar
right in the middle when we're in the rising interest rate, asset sensitive, enjoying the margin expansion and
instead of like going for 4-point-somewhat-percent margin increase quarter after quarter, we dialed it back down.
We started dial it back down even early last year. And we continued dial it back down even during this crisis. And
[indiscernible] (00:49:15) $500 million, dialed it back down to me.
And the whole idea is that, hey, even with all of that, we still cranked up over 20% return of equity. So, why
stretch? Because as long as we keep doing this balancing act, managing the balance sheet prudently, but being
extremely aggressive in terms of ensure we perform to the best we can, opportunity will come, because we will
eventually position ourselves with a level that will attract others and they maybe want to join forces with us.
So, I look at it as we have no control of what other people will do. We do have controls of what we can do. And we
keep working hard to make sure that we crank up one of the best performing metrics; and then in the meantime,
making sure the capital stay high, so, we have all kinds of flexibility' and then making sure liquidity stay high, so
13

that we'll have all kinds of flexibility to do what we need to do; and then managing the credit risk as the best we
can, so that we do not go sideways when the opportunity comes. And that's what we've been doing for the last
many years. I've been in the bank for 30 years now. So just the same-old thing, one crisis [indiscernible]
(00:50:47) crisis, managing the same way, one at a time and all worked up. And so far so good.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask around the NII guide. Can you talk about what that would
be? If you take out the rate cuts in the back half there, just given that the forward curve has come up a decent
amount at quarter end, I was wondering if there is any change in that tide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. I think if that doesn't happen, right now, we're modeling various scenarios. Given where just
the high level of our rates are, certainly, one of the things I wanted to share is, even if rates don't decline, we are
modeling that deposit betas will continue to inch up just realistically, given this kind of environment. So, if that
doesn't happen, certainly there may be a little bit more relief there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Any sense of quantification of what that would be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
No, I don't have that in front of me. But I can share that with you after the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, as we think about credit, you gave great color on CRE by property type in the deck. Can
you talk about the trends you're seeing with new property appraisals? Are you seeing that – what kinds of
declines are you seeing in those new property appraisals? And then also, if you have it, how much of your
portfolio has already been appraised for new values and how much of it is still appraised at the time of
origination?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's a great question. Generally speaking, we don't reappraise the existing loans, but certainly there's market
data that we get a simulation. It really depends honestly property by property and when the loan was originated.
All in all and to a certain extent, I don't know if averages are about meaningful here. We don't see a substantial
change. If we estimate what the current – as I mentioned, I think loan by loan is more important.
But with that said, I think with our underwriting criteria, the low loan-to-values that we originated it and what that
means is strong cash flows. As Dominic mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're not seeing a lot of problems as
14

we continue to review these portfolios again and again. It's like a continuous review process. I'd say it's very
positive that we do not see new surprises.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, thanks. First one for me just on your office CRE exposure. Appreciate the additional detail. Can you give us
the reserve on office CRE? And is there any amount of that exposure that's criticized at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. Only we have the details on the total allowance. We do have a little bit more allowance on
the office CRE. On average, I would say, it's about – for the total portfolio, about 1.5%. And I'll just also mention, a
lot of that is in qualitative factors versus the quantitative.
On the credit side, the level in general is very low of our office CRE. I think if I look at it – I don't have the number
off the top of my head, Matthew, but it's pretty consistent with the total criticized loans for the CRE bucket, which
is about 2.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then the second one for me, just on the change in accounting that eliminates the TDRs, I guess,
what does this do for you? Does it provide you additional flexibility to work with the borrowers, maybe by
extending the amortization schedule and not having to call it a TDR? Any additional color there would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. And generally, accounting changed offer more excitement for allowance and
banks, but not this quarter, given what happened. If you look at our allowance table that's part of our press
release, you'll see that with the change in the accounting of TDR, what this did for us is that we, instead of
individually looking at these loans for impairment, if we look at it kind of a collective basis, we added $6 million of
reserves, and that was for about a $75 million of performing TDRs. And I'll just note this is generally what we see
with our loan portfolio. When you compare the allowance for a pool and the different PD, probability default, loss
given default calculations for some of them versus individually looking at them, the individual allowance levels are
a little bit lower. But I think I'd just go back to the comment earlier, the testament of the collateral for a lot of these
loans that we have.
Aside from that, Matthew, your question on our workout strategy and the flexibility of that, that it's less of an issue
for us. We continue to do what we think is right for the property, for the borrower and for the bank.

So, Irene, I just wanted to get your updated assumptions on the deposit mix and how it could evolve or progress
from here throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question, and maybe the most topical one given the current environment. Given kind of the disruption
in mid-March and where we're at right now, quite frankly, we do expect continued modest kind of decline in DDA
balances, right, just realistically, given the environment and the sensitivity around our core funding and the market
pressure. But with that said, we are confident that we'll be able to continue to grow deposit balances from here
with the diversification of our customers, our different bankers, and really also the resilience that we have seen.
We're comfortable from that perspective, and that's factored in with the NII guidance and what our expectation is
for the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And as far as your customers that have derivative contracts in place, could you give us a sense of the
duration of those derivative contracts and a better sense of, as far as, you know, the magnitude of how many of
those contracts are may be expiring this year or into the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I don't have the duration of that off the top of my head. There are over the course of the next couple of
years, some of the interest rate contracts are going to be maturing. I think if you look specifically for CRE, it's
probably in the tune of maybe a few – several hundred million.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Hey. Good morning. I think maybe just following up on the comments around holding excess cash, how should we
be thinking about the appetite to hold on to the bank term funding facility? Is that really specifically allocated to
those cash balances? Or what's your expectation for duration on keeping that outstanding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. I think obviously at this point in time, we're holding it on for – holding on to it, really
from a conservative perspective. We'll evaluate that, right, with our need for cash, what happens with deposits.
And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, at this point in time, although obviously it's not beneficial from
NIM, it's NII accretive. So I think we're just looking at that as really kind of a rainy day. We'll evaluate that over the
course of the year.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I'll also add, from a monthly, quarterly perspective, on the securities book, it's $200 million to $300 million that
we're kind of winding down from as far as cash flow from that. So, we'll evaluate as far as other sources of cash
as well aside from other funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then maybe just – have you noticed any change in the pace of capital
exports coming from China or any change in the appetite of some of that capital moving? Or do you expect any
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Not much. It's been slow for ever since the geopolitical tension has risen since Trump administration, it's been
slow – I mean, slowing down. And then I would look at it is at, lately, I have not seen any sort of like a new
development of new capital coming from China. But we continue to work with business throughout Asia. So, it's
not just single – we're not just looking at attracting new customers who are investing in US from China only. So –
but at this point, I would say, more or less flat.
On the other hand, I think that we will like to see how US economy continue to develop. If we're ever going to get
into a somewhat of a mild recession or even maybe a deeper than mild recession, I would expect that there will
be interested parties throughout Asia to have excess liquidity. They will be looking at any opportunity of investing
in US. But in this kind of environment right now, just in general, not many interested investors have much appetite
to make a move. I think everybody's watching, and then trying to see how this economy plays out. And then at
that point – at some point, I think people may see opportunity. When that happen, we obviously would have the
opportunity to provide banking and financing services.

open, if you would like to ask your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry about that. I was still muted. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Irene, I just wanted to follow up
on the deposit beta commentary. You had mentioned increasing beta assumptions within your guidance. I just
wanted to see if you could clarify what the base interest bearing deposit beta is currently versus what it was
previously.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. So, if we look at the betas, right, as of 3/31, our cumulative beta for total deposits was 39%;
for interest bearing, it was 57%. This is where we thought we'd be earlier in the year. Later in the year, with the
disruption we got there in a short period of time, in a couple of weeks in March, when I looked at the remainder of
the year and we're looking at our deposits, the behavior, the activity of the different segments, we do think this is
going to inch up from this point in time. But honestly, also, many of our commercial deposits and our operating
accounts that are compensating balances, so although we do expect it to increase, really probably modestly from
here to like a low-60s, very low-60s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. Thank you for that. And then I did just want to ask on the deposit front, I was just trying to
[indiscernible] (01:03:57) the intra-quarter update with last quarter versus this quarter in particular, just
understanding the flow on the non-broker deposits. And so, it looked like when you gave that initial update, intra-
quarter that, for non-brokered deposits, you were actually up, like 0.6% or something quarter-over-quarter. And
then, when I look at the deck, it looks like for non-brokered deposits, just trying to back into the number, you
wound up finishing the quarter down a little over 3%. Are those numbers accurate? And I guess just can you give
us a sense for – if there were any specific verticals that drove that reduction in the non-brokered deposits for the
last few weeks of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. Intra-quarter – and we did get that update intra-quarter in mid-March, we were up,
consumer deposits were up, and also commercial deposits were slightly, modestly up, kind of essentially stable.
So, overall, I mean, I think since the failure of Silicon Valley, there was some disruption around us. I think the
different segments and the sectors, maybe not so particular, but just overall. And then, also there were broker
deposits that we had let run off in early March that we – we brought some of those back.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. Two quick things. One, can you comment at all on
trends in April, both on the available-for-sale market as interest rates have fallen and also deposit trends?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
On the trends for the March, I'll start with that, Jordan. Generally, they've been positive across the board for us, so
that certainly helps. And I'll just share [indiscernible] (01:06:00) look at the quarter, the impact to AOCI, right, the
benefit – or the improvement was about 11% quarter-over-quarter. And then, we see that that's continuing in April.
As far as deposit trends, I would say, overall, it's about the same. We're kind of clawing back a little bit. But
overall, it's – what's positive is that the pipelines are strong. As Dominic mentioned, we're continuing to open new
accounts, commercial accounts, consumer accounts. So that's something that we think is very positive as far as
the momentum.

Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, Irene didn't coordinate with me. So, I've been so busy working. But it was funny, because so many
customers talked to me about they got lucky on that one day, when the stock price just went crazy – I mean, all
the regional banks' stock price went crazy. I think, for us, like, for like – I guess maybe I don't know about –
because I wasn't even – I think I wasn't even in town. So – but I had customers telling me about they were getting
in at $40. So excited about it. I didn't even know it happened. So – but I look at it as our management is always in
a position that we always take position as that – this is our bank and our actions speak louder than everything
else.
And quite frankly, back in 1998, when we did the management buyout, myself and the then CFO, we came in and
basically used our liquidity to put it all in East West Bank and buying the shares at the same price like every
investor who came in for that capital raise. And so, it worked out, worked out great. And we continue to put
substantial amount of our compensation into performance stock. That if we don't make the numbers, we don't get
the stock. And those performance stocks are working out very well, not just, by the way, for senior executives, but
in fact, throughout the whole bank, every single employee, including part-time teller, every single one get stock
grant, every single year since 1998, when we've completed our management buyout.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Since that day, June of 1998, we started giving stock grant every year to every single employee exactly the same
amount. We started with $1,000 a year and inching up to $2,000 a year. But every year – every Lunar New Year,
we provide a stock grant to every single employee. And this is something that worked out really well for East
West. Every single 3,000-plus associate at the bank have stock ownership. They believe that they are owner of
East West Bank. We think our employees think that I work for them, because they are shareholders. So – and
that kind of like mutually beneficial relationship, I think working out just fine for us.
So, we will continue to look into opportunities – when it comes to shall we buy and not buy and all that, I mean,
we're right now with all these SEC stuff, we try not to do too much as much as we – we don't want to get into any
kind of hassle. Let's put it that way.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I'd just add that, Monday, I took all the cash I had and bought the stock. Hopefully, investors know that that when
the CFO buys, management's confident in the bank.
