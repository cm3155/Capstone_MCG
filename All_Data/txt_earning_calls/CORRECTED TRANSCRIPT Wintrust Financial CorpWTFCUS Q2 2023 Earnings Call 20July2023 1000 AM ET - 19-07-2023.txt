Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Timothy S. Crane
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In
addition to Dave Dykstra and Rich Murphy who the operator introduced, Dave Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer;
and Kate Boege, our General Counsel, are with me in the room today.
In terms of an agenda, I'll share some high level highlights. Dave will speak to the financial results, and Rich will
add some additional information and color on credit performance. I'll wrap up with some summary thoughts. And
as we always do, we'll do our best to answer some questions.
On our last call, in mid-April, we were still in a period of volatility; and to a degree, uncertainty for the banks. At the
time, we talked about several objectives: continuing to focus on our customers, capitalizing on our strength and
stability, once again, being opportunistic when there is disruption in the market. We talked about managing the
balance sheet in a conservative fashion, growing deposits to fund loan growth and continuing to enhance liquidity.
And we talked about continuing to take advantage of higher rates, specifically to demonstrate our ability despite
rising deposit costs to stabilize the net interest margin.
We feel like our performance on these objectives has been very solid. In addition to reporting record income for
the first half of the year, for the second quarter, we had strong and balanced loan and deposit growth, adding
clients and building the franchise through the volatile period when others were distracted. We improved liquidity,
reducing Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings; and as you will hear shortly, have demonstrated through the sale
of a portfolio of loans that occurred after the quarter end the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet
effectively.
And while, as expected, deposit costs are up, we are originating very high quality loans with attractive both yields
and terms and continue to benefit from loan repricing, which we believe differentiates us from many of our peers.
Just to give you some detail, you'll recall our margin was 3.83% for the first quarter and specifically 3.70% at the
end of March. Our margin for the second quarter, despite the very good growth, was 3.66%; and importantly, was
stable throughout the quarter. Lastly, our credit performance remains strong with no evidence of systemic issues.
Rich will discuss this in some detail, including proactive steps that illustrate our ability to address any softening
that may occur.
Again, I'll come back at the end. But with that, I'll turn this over to Dave to provide some additional detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Okay. Thanks, Tim. First, with respect to the balance sheet growth, we're very pleased to see deposits for the
quarter grow by $1.3 billion or 12.4% on an annualized basis. This deposit growth was aided by the popularity of
our suite of MaxSafe products that provide enhanced FDIC coverage, and we did not rely upon additional
wholesale deposits during the quarter for that growth. This growth was also, despite our wealth management
deposits declining by just under $400 million, growing in large part to less deposits from our 1031 exchange
business due to a slowdown in tax-free commercial real estate exchanges in the marketplace.
As to deposit composition, we, again, saw some additional movement from noninterest bearing deposits to
interest bearing accounts. The noninterest bearing deposits at the end of the quarter represented 24% of our total
deposits, compared to 26% at the end of the first quarter. These movements do not appear to be unique to us, but

they obviously increase the cost of deposits for the quarter. Although I would note that the mix shift out of
noninterest bearing deposits seems to have subsided thus far this quarter as the percentage is relatively stable
now than it was at the end of the second quarter.
This strong deposit growth helped fund similarly strong loan growth of $1.5 billion during the second quarter. The
growth was predominantly fueled by exceptionally strong production from our commercial premium finance
operations; and to a lesser extent, from commercial real estate growth, including draws on previously existing
credit lines. Rich Murphy will discuss the loan portfolio growth in more detail in just a bit.
The investment portfolio declined slightly as we only reinvested about a third of the $940 million of securities that
were called away at the end of the prior quarter. The additional liquidity provided by not reinvesting the entire
amount of those called securities also helped to fund the quarter's loan growth. The company was able to reduce
its non-deposit funding, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the quarter by $208 million.
The result of these balance sheet movements was a growth in total assets of approximately $1.4 billion, a slightly
elevated ending loan-to-deposit ratio of 93.2% and relatively stable capital ratios. All in all, it was a very
successful quarter; and growing our franchise, our differentiated business model, exceptional service and unique
position in the Chicago and Milwaukee markets continue to serve us well.
As Tim mentioned, the exceptionally strong growth in our commercial premium finance portfolio and the outlook
for continued loan growth provided us with an opportunity to structure a loan sale transaction of approximately
$500 million of our US Commercial Premium Finance portfolio. This loan sale occurred earlier this week and
provided multiple benefits to us, including that it demonstrates that our premium finance portfolio is a strong
source of additional liquidity if needed.
Actually, it provided us with liquidity this quarter to aid in funding anticipated loan growth, reduces our loan-to-
deposit ratio to a desired operating level that is closer to 90%, reduces some of the concentration in the premium
finance space as we've had strong growth over the last quarter, and quite frankly, over the last year, and would
provide a small gain in the third quarter from the sale of those loans. As you know, these loans are very short-
term loans that make monthly payments, and they'll likely be replaced substantially by new volume by the end of
the year.
Next, I'll cover noteworthy income statement categories, starting with the net interest income. For the second
quarter of 2023, net interest income totaled $447.5 million. That was a decrease of $10.5 million as compared to
the prior quarter and an increase of $109.7 million compared to the same quarter of 2022. The decrease in net
interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the compression in the net interest margin
influenced by the higher funding cost.
The net interest margin was 3.66% in the second quarter, which was just slightly less than the 3.7% margin that
we discussed on our first quarter earnings call and which was the approximate run rate at the end of March.
However, the margin was 17 basis points less than the prior quarter level of 3.83%. Importantly, the net interest
margin was stable for each of the months in the second quarter. And as I'll discuss later, we expect the margin to
continue to remain relatively stable for the remainder of 2023.
As to the details of the component changes impacting the margin in the second quarter relative to the first quarter,
the company saw a beneficial increase of 42 basis points on the yield on earning assets, excluding the impact of
our interest rate swap positions, a 15-basis-point increase in the net free funds contribution. And offsetting that
was increase of 66 basis points of an increase on the rate paid on liabilities.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
And it's important to note that roughly half of the margin decline during the quarter was associated with an
additional 8 basis points of margin drag from a full quarter impact of the interest rate swap positions that we have
in place. Those swaps were generally put on in the first quarter, and the first quarter only had a portion of the
impact. So, this quarter was fully baked and was accounted for about half of the margin decline.
We continue to believe that our balance sheet structure can provide margin stability as our premium finance
portfolios, which comprise roughly a third of our loan portfolio, should continue to reprice upward over the course
of this year, and that should substantially mitigate the rise in deposit pricing. Accordingly, based on the current
interest rate environment which includes an expected 25 basis point increase by the Fed later this month, we
expect our margin to remain relatively steady in the 3.60% to 3.70% range during the remainder of 2023.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, the company recorded a provision for credit losses of $28.5 million in the
second quarter. This is compared to a provision of $23 million in the prior quarter and $20.4 million of provision
expense recorded in the year ago quarter. The higher provision expense in the second quarter relative to the prior
quarter was primarily a result of a higher loan growth, changes in macroeconomic outlooks including projected
credit spreads and projected commercial real estate price index, and slightly higher net charge-offs. Again, Rich
Murphy will talk about credit and the loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit.
As to other noninterest income and other noninterest expense, total noninterest income totaled $113 million in the
second quarter and was up approximately $5.2 million compared to the prior quarter, total of $107.8 million. The
primary reason for the increase were due to an $11 million increase in mortgage banking revenue. The mortgage
banking operation saw a slight increase in volume of loans originated during the second quarter with relatively
stable production margins.
Roughly 84% of the application volume is still related to purchased home activity. Application activity continues to
be subdued due to lack of housing inventory and higher rates, but we would expect right now similar to slightly
elevated production, but nothing dramatic in the third quarter.
Wealth management revenues improved by $3.9 million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. And this
was bolstered by revenue from the acquisition that we closed at the beginning of the quarter and offset somewhat
by continued headwinds relative to the slowdown in the commercial real estate transactions and the resulting
impact on the 1031 exchange business revenue.
However, these increases were offset by a $1.4 million reduction on gains and losses related to the company's
securities portfolio. The company recorded a $1.4 million gain in the first quarter on securities sales, and really
nothing in the second quarter of this year. $7.8 million decrease in covered call options also impacted this
revenue category. As I discussed earlier, we did not reinvest much of our securities that were called and this
created less opportunity to write covered call transactions during the quarter.
Turning to noninterest expense categories, the noninterest expenses totaled $320.6 million in the second quarter
and were up approximately $21.4 million when compared to the prior year quarter total of $299.2 million. The
primary reasons for the increases were related to a few general areas.
First, the acquisition of the wealth management companies at the beginning of the quarter added roughly $4
million of additional expense sprinkled throughout the various expense categories. But excluding that impact,
salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2022
compared to the first quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
And relative to the prior quarter, there was $4.7 million increase largely related to higher mortgage commissions;
and to a lesser extent, incentive compensation accruals. So, most of that was commissions related to the
increased mortgage operation. So, this category fluctuates depending upon the mortgage volume.
The category also saw approximately $4.1 million of higher employee benefit expenses due to an increased level
of health insurance claims during the quarter. Health insurance claims can fluctuate on a monthly basis as we're
self-insured. The first quarter was a little low. The second quarter was a little higher. It can fluctuate, but the
change between quarters was really more probably a timing of when the employees took advantage of our health
insurance program.
Next, advertising and marketing expenses increased by $5.8 million in the second quarter when compared to the
prior quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, this category of expense tends to be higher in the second
and third quarters of the year due to expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball
sponsorships, other summertime sponsorship events that we hold in the communities that we serve and
marketing of our brand and deposit products.
Also in the second quarter, lending expenses increased approximately $4.8 million due to the strong and higher
overall loan origination activity in the second quarter. And other than that, the expense categories just discussed –
other than the expense categories just discussed above, all the other expense categories were relatively
consistent.
The efficiency ratio increased to 57% for the second quarter from 53% in the first quarter of the year. And this was
primarily due to the impact of lower net interest margins, the reduced level of covered call income and the slightly
elevated expenses. The net overhead ratio was 1.58% in the second quarter, an increase from 1.49% in the prior
quarter due to the slightly higher expenses.
In summary, we think this was a very solid quarter. We had strong loan and deposit growth, improved liquidity
position, stabilized net interest margin with a steady outlook, net revenues that were more than 1% of the prior
quarter's record level despite funding cost pressures, continued low levels of non-performing assets, and the
second highest quarterly net income result in the company's history. We feel like we've managed through a
turbulent first half of 2023 delivering net income that was a record for the first half of any fiscal year in the
company's history, and we have a positive outlook for continued growth in assets, revenues and earnings.
So with that, I will conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance continued to be very solid in the second quarter from a
number of perspectives. As detailed on slide 6 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $1.5 billion. The loan
growth was largely attributable to over $1 billion of growth in the commercial premium finance category. This
growth is due to a number of factors.
The second quarter is historically when we see our highest funding volume. And as we have noted in the past
several quarters, we have seen a significantly harder market for insurance premiums, particularly for commercial
properties. As a result, we have seen the average loan size increase.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Finally, we continue to see new opportunities as a result of consolidation within the premium finance industry. We
also saw a good growth in commercial real estate, largely resulting from draws on existing construction loans and
portfolio residential real estate loans.
This rate of loan growth is significantly higher than the first quarter and well above our guidance of mid-to-high
single digits. We believe that loan growth for the second half of the year will be more in line with our guidance as
we anticipate the premium finance loan growth will moderate and be more in line with historic norms. We also
anticipate that higher borrowing costs will continue to affect borrowers to reconsider the economics of new
projects, business expansion, and equipment purchases. However, we continue to see solid momentum in our
core C&I and CRE pipelines. Disruptions in the banking landscape continue to work to our benefit, and we have
seen numerous quality opportunities from other regional banks.
In summary, we continue to be optimistic of our loan growth for the balance of 2023, and we believe that our
diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid-
to-high single digits and maintain our credit discipline.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 14, we continue to see strong credit performance across
the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Nonperforming loans remain stable at 26 basis points or
$109 million, up slightly from what we saw in the first quarter. Overall, NPLs continue to be at historically low
levels, and we are still confident about the solid credit performance of the portfolio.
Charge-offs for the quarter were $17 million or 17 basis points, which was up from the prior quarter, but still at a
relatively low level. This higher level was primarily attributable to a charge of $8 million, which resulted from the
sale of a portfolio to coworking office loans totaling $17 million.
As we have noted in previous calls, we are constantly looking for signs of stress in our portfolios and are very
focused on our non-owner-occupied office portfolio. The common denominator of the loans we sold was the
coworking nature of the tenants. We believe that this subsegment of the market will continue to experience
significant stress from weak tenant demand and rising cost of debt, and we took this opportunity to meaningfully
reduce our exposure. This sale made up close to half of our exposure into this subcategory. We have always
looked at strategic options to reduce exposures to areas of concern within our portfolio, and we will continue to do
so.
Finally, as detailed on slide 14, we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no
meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level.
As noted in our last earnings call, we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate
loans, which compose roughly one quarter of our total loan portfolio. Higher borrowing costs and pressure on
occupancy and lease rates are cause for concern, particularly in the office category.
On page 18, we've updated a number of important characteristics of our office portfolio. Currently, this portfolio
remains steady at $1.4 billion or 13.2% of our total CRE portfolio, and only 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. Of the
$1.4 billion of office exposure, over 40% is medical office or owner-occupied. The average size of a loan in the
office portfolio is only $1.3 million. We only have five loans above $20 million. There has been significant concern
about office properties located within central business districts. Our CBD exposure is limited to $350 million or
approximately one quarter of the office portfolio. Half of this is in Chicago and half is in other cities. The bulk of the
portfolio is located in suburban areas and areas outside CBDs.

And portfolio performance to-date has been very good with no loans currently over 90 days past due. We
continue to perform portfolio reviews regularly on this portfolio, and we stay very engaged with our borrowers. We
are not immune from the macro effects that challenge this product type, but we believe that our portfolio is well
constructed, very granular, and should perform well moving forward.
As noted earlier, higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease renewals are cause for concern across the CRE
space. To better understand how these issues could impact our portfolio, our CRE team updated their deep dive
analysis on every loan over $2.5 million, which will be renewing between now through the first quarter of 2024.
This analysis, which covered 79% of all CRE loans maturing during this period, resulted in the following.
More than 52% of the loans will clearly qualify for renewal at the prevailing rates. Roughly 32% of these loans are
anticipated to be paid off or will require a short-term extension at prevailing rates. And approximately 16% of the
loans will require some additional attention, which could include a paydown or pledge of additional collateral. We
have tentative agreement on renewal terms with many of the borrowers in this final group.
Again, our overall CRE portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease
rates, but we have been diligently identifying weaknesses in the portfolio and working with our borrowers to
identify the best possible outcomes. And we believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape and situated to
weather the challenges ahead.
That concludes my comments on credit, and I'll turn it back to Tim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich.
To wrap up, for the last several months, we've had the opportunity and, in some cases, I would say the
responsibility to explain to our customers why Wintrust continues to be a better alternative than the larger too-big-
to-fail banks. Not only have we successfully done that with almost no attrition, but we continue to win business,
and as you can see, grow deposits and build our franchise.
We continue to think we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse
businesses that limit the potential impact of economic softness in any individual area, and we remain positioned to
benefit from higher rates. As Dave noted and we noted in the press release, we expect that our margin will be
relatively stable for the remainder of the year, and our net interest income will increase in the coming quarters.
I would say that the current market is a little bit choppy, and we remain incredibly focused to pursue opportunities
that we see, and we'll do that aggressively in the coming months.
At this point, I'll pause and we can take some questions. Elizabeth, back to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital
Markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I'm going to start off – first question, I guess. You used the word choppy, Tim, and you guys talked about a
little bit slower loan growth in the second half of the year, but you put up a pretty good quarter. And I guess my
question is, what are the pipelines look like? What's the quality of what you're seeing? And very early, Tim, you
alluded to like pricing and structure being better, but touch a little bit on that in terms of how that may have
changed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take the first part and Rich can add to that. With respect to choppy, companies are obviously reacting to
higher rates and certainly real estate projects in some cases are on hold. And there's folks still wrestling with labor
issues, which we think are generally better but not universally better. And then, obviously, there are some
competitors that are pulling back in terms of credit and their participation in the market.
And so we're seeing opportunities. I think a lot of people are seeing opportunities, and we just have to be
selective and disciplined. And I think our team is doing a nice job in that regard, which is driving both higher yields
and better terms, in some cases, more equity and real estate deals.
So, Rich, please add to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think you said it well. Every week that goes by, we see new opportunities really across the portfolio in
terms of customers who aren't getting their existing banks to work with them in a productive way. And we're also
seeing tremendous amount of opportunities on large capital market-type opportunities where there is multiple
banks involved. And there's almost more than you could possibly want, frankly, because there is just so much
that's out there right now. So it does give us the opportunity to pick and choose price accordingly, structure
accordingly. We've always had a history of being disciplined in the space, and that's not going to change. But it's
a great opportunity for us.

Disruption always has worked to our benefit. Post-pandemic, post-PPP, we saw a very similar kind of
environment where a lot of banks were kind of struggling, getting their footing. We're seeing that right now as well.
And so we're pretty optimistic, but most importantly, we just want to stay disciplined.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough. The premium finance size limits on your balance sheet, we expect to see more of these sales.
And I'm just curious if you guys continue to service that. I know they're short, very short term in nature, but help us
understand the outlook for that in terms of on your balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. So the 500 we sold is an off-balance sheet transactions. That will come off of the books in the third quarter.
And Jon, as you know, and probably most people on this call know, is that those loans probably make monthly
payments on average – have an average life of 9 months to 10 months. So by the end of the year, they'll
substantially have been paid off anyway.
So if you recall, we did a securitization of premium finance loans a decade ago or so, and it gives about a $300
million – or $600 million facility that we did for a few years. And so it's not a new transaction for us, but we thought
it was important to get the plumbing in place. We had $1 billion quarter, a great growth quarter. The market is still
hard. The disruptions helped us. The outlook is good there.
And so we thought getting the plumbing in place and sort of testing it out, having another source of liquidity was a
good thing to do. We have the opportunity to do it in the future. But right now, we don't have any plans to do
another loan sale. But if we were to have outside the loan growth going forward, we might be able to pull the
trigger and do it quickly. And now that we've demonstrated that, we can do it again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
And Jon, yes, we continue to service those loans. I think it was part of your question.

David Alan Dykstra A

Yeah. I mean, we're just a few weeks into the third quarter, but application volumes have ticked up just slightly. So
I would expect that to be up a little bit, but as part of it depends on what happens to the valuations of your MSRs,
too. But from a production perspective, I would expect it to be up just a little bit, and we'll just have to see how the
production flows through. But nothing substantial there. But if it's up a couple of million dollars, that might be at
the right neighborhood. But we'll have to just see how it plays through.

Morning, David.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning. I was kind of blanked out there. I didn't hear if that was my name or not. But good morning,
everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
A couple of things. On the funding side, you seem to still have good growth. Obviously, you've got a vehicle now
where you can reduce or securitize or sell some of those loans. But on the funding side, going forward, how are
you thinking about incremental FHLB advances versus deposits, whether it's CDs or brokered CDs? Which is the
most attractive source on the funding side right now and how do the costs compare right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure, David. I mean, generally, we'd like to grow deposits to match any loan growth, and we think deposits are the
core of our franchise. Obviously, the MaxSafe product suite was very helpful to us in the quarter. Clients didn't
have to go elsewhere. Even at competitors where there are reciprocal products, we don't have to pay the
additional fee that might be involved with that. So, that worked out very, very well.
11


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
The MaxSafe product, in general, is in total a little less than 4% in terms of the deposit cost. And we're putting
loans on it, 7.5% to 8% at this point. So, the spread is good. We continue to add business. Everybody is asking
for deposits. It's a focus. So, we're going to try to grow deposits before we use other liquidity sources.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Tim. And then, for the competitive dynamics for deposits right now, are you seeing more pressure
from the larger regional banks? Are you seeing more pressure from the community banks? Where is the
competition more intense on the deposit side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, all over would be my blanket answer, but certainly the regional banks. And Rich mentioned that some
companies are finding it more difficult to get, what I would call, transactional-type work done. And for folks that
just don't have a relationship with their bank, the relationship can be either uncertain or strained at this point.
And we're very focused on having relationships and taking good care of our clients. And so, one, that hasn't been
difficult for us for our existing base; and two, it's created an opportunity in certain places to see new clients that,
frankly, we're very happy to be doing business with.

Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Hi. Good morning. Maybe a question on expenses. Some other banks are facing some
NII pressure and prospects of rising credit costs. Could you just talk about maybe expense management plans
and your thoughts on expenses over the next two to four quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure. I mean, we're always looking out for expenses. Our approach has generally been to grow the balance sheet
and try to grow the revenues at a quicker pace than the expenses. And like we've talked, we're pretty optimistic
about balance sheet growth and pretty optimistic about maintaining the margin which would translate into
increased NII. So from that perspective, we're very optimistic.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
On the expense side, this quarter had, as I said, a few increases, the seasonal marketing, the addition of the
expenses from the acquisitions, and slightly elevated lending expenses due to the double-digit loan growth and
increased mortgage production. So, those were the primary reasons for the increase this quarter, but we're
always looking at expenses.
We're very focused on them right now to keep them in check and try to keep them less than the revenue growth
going forward. But we don't want to cut to the bone here and not take advantage of the growth opportunities in the
marketplace. We've always done that. We've always taken advantage of the disruption, and we think we're in
great position to do that again.

Thanks, Dave. And then as a follow-up, it sounds like next week we're going to get updated regulation for banks,
over $100 billion of assets. What's the risk that that kind of dribbles down into banks, maybe $50 billion and
above? And how are you thinking about any changes in regulation for a bank that's, what, $54 billion or $55 billion
of assets today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I guess, we'll watch with great interest what they come out with. But I think you're right. I think most of it's
focused at $100 billion. We're really not there yet. I think most of the focus will be on interest rate risk and liquidity
management at the supervisory level right now and making sure that the risk management in place there. We
think we do a great job with that.
So, we're not that concerned about it. But we'll watch with interest what they come up with, but we don't have any
plans of hitting $100 billion in the next year or so here. So, I think we have some time to plan for it.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I'm curious if we could talk through deposit pricing just a little bit. I know we've touched on it a couple of different
ways. But first, I wanted to confirm that the guidance of 3.60% to 3.70% on margin incorporates any sort of mix
shift that might happen?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. Just confirming that one. So when you think about the incremental dollar at this point, without
giving away too much of your playbook, how are you guys approaching the next dollar? Are you looking for
relationships that automatically have to bring over deposits from day one on the new loans? Are you looking for
any different niche avenues of deposit pricing or deposit gathering at a lower price and then kind of juxtaposing
that? So, how has the flows or mix shift changed over the last, call it, 60 days?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Well, we're always looking to gather deposits at lower costs. And with the commercial relationships we win, come
the Treasury businesses and the operating accounts that are generally at the most favorable price. The MaxSafe
product for us is mostly interest-bearing. There's several flavors of it. Some that are from municipalities, for
example, and some that are for our corporate customers. At the margin, that's, call it, 4%. And then we've been
offering some promotional type CD activity that we really use to kind of balance the remainder of the activity.
So we've got a lot of levers to pull. We're certainly asking for deposits with our customers. But frankly, that's not
anything new for us. I mean, we want the relationships, and we want the operating accounts from these
companies. So we think we can gather deposits at an appropriate level that allow us to operate as we have. And
we talked about the loan yields and structures being attractive to us. And so we don't think at the moment we're
giving up a lot in terms of spread.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And we also – this is Dave, right. We also think we – we have a great position in the Chicago market.
We've got the fourth largest deposit market share behind three big guys: Chase, Bank of America and BMO. And
then it really falls off at least for banks headquartered in Chicago, in Illinois. We actually have the largest market
share, and we're less than 10% in Chicago and in Illinois, quite frankly. And the big banks, really, as we talked
earlier, aren't the ones putting the pressure on.
Some of the regional banks that have presence here are offering higher rates, and the community banks are
pretty disciplined. So if someone wants to do business with a larger bank that's located in Illinois, we're sort of the
go-to bank, and we give great service. So we think we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of this and offer
good products, give good service and cement in the customer relationship. So we're kind of excited about the
opportunities there.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. That's helpful. And then if we could switch gears a little bit towards credit. I know the guidance here was
a little bit softer loan growth in the back half of the year to get more in line with previous guidance. When you think
about the provision, I know that CECL is a large component, and frankly, the first half of this year feels like the
first half of the decade. So it's a bit unknown, economically speaking. But how do you guys think about the
provision going forward? If loan growth slows a little, do you think that provision could come down from here or
how do you guys approach it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Well, CECL is a life of loan concept as far as forecasting out what the losses are in your existing portfolio. So,
yeah, if there's a loan growth that's higher or lower, that's going to impact it. Obviously, there's a mix issue. If we
grow a lot in the life or commercial premium finance portfolios, those are less provision than a CRE loan or a
commercial loan. But generally speaking, if you have higher growth, then we'll have a higher provision.
But the things that impact the provision substantially are some of the economic factors. So if the forecast from the
economists that are out there get less recession-focused and more soft landing or mild recession-focused, then I
think some of those economic forecast factors will get better and that would have a positive impact on the
provision. But I'm not an economist. I don't make economic predictions. But we follow Moody's. We follow some
other economic forecasts as we've modeled out our CECL. So I would suspect unless there's a big change in the
economic forecast that growth would be the item that would impact the provision.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Good morning. Dave, just a question on the kind of a nuance on the capital, the covered call strategy. How
do we think about, I guess, broadly you reinvest in going forward that line item and obviously it will play into the
size of the overall earning asset base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, our securities – I mean, generally, we like to run in the roughly 90% loan-to-deposit ratio. And then the
remaining liquidity is either overnight money or securities. And our securities have generally been 12%, 13% of
the asset base. And so we would expect to sort of keep it in that range and use our liquidity to fund what we
expect to be good loan growth. So the reinvestment of the cash flows up the securities, we would put back into
15

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
some sort of asset class. And we've generally done Ginnie Maes, And if you do Ginnies or Fannies, you can write
covered calls against them.
So where you generally get higher covered calls is when rates go down and the securities get called away and
then you reinvest those securities and then you write calls against them again, or in a flat rate environment where
you can continue to write calls on them quarter-after-quarter. But I would suspect that given the demand we have
for loan and given that we are sort of at a decent spot, we could – the investment portfolio go up another $500
million or $1 billion or something over time as we grow here probably. But that's not going to create a tremendous
amount of covered calls.
So I would probably say in this environment, if you're thinking $2 million to $5 million of covered calls, maybe a
normal range given the interest rate environment and our investments right now, that's probably not a bad way to
look at it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just two small ones. Maybe a comment on gain on sale margins for mortgage. And
then I want to make sure I heard you. The $8 million loss on that, is that a $17 million sale for roughly a little under
50% loss rate on the office loans? Is that what I heard?

That's correct.

Good morning, Brody.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, everyone. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just wanted to ask on the fixed rate loan portfolio. It's about $17.5 billion. I just wanted to make sure that the $7.8
billion to $7.9 billion that you mentioned, that reprices or matures over the next year or so? Do you happen to
know what the existing yield is on that portfolio and then like what the origination rates look like right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Well, if you look at that $7.8 billion, $6.6 billion of it is fixed rate commercial premium finance loans. So the vast
majority of that is the commercial premium finance portfolio, which one-ninth of that basically turns over every
month. So those loans generally are pricing that just net-net sort of prime plus one range, plus or minus
depending on the mix of large loans versus small loans. So that portfolio will be turning over. And you can go
back and look. We put it in our press release. We sort of show what the indices are. You can go back and look at
what prime was nine months ago and what it is now, and that should be roughly the pickup you'd get in the yield
on those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you very much. And then I did want to ask just within the available-for-sale portfolio. You gave the
effective duration of 6.5. I wanted to ask you if you knew what the conditional prepayment rate you're assuming
within that duration calculation is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I don't have it handy right now. The majority of those are Ginnie Maes. But I don't know what – I don't have it

Brody Preston Q

Okay. Great. And I just want to ask just on the CRE deep dive that you talked about where I think it was 32%
would need some service type of short-term extensions, 16%, a little additional attention. 50% or 52% qualifying
for a renewal.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
I guess, is that the way it works down, you kind of look at it and you say you qualify, you might need a short-term
extension, you probably need some more equity? I guess, like what drives the delineation between just needing a
short-term extension and maybe needing to bring more equity in the table? And then if you could just on the one
that need a short-term extension, like what happens after they get the short-term extension, like how long is the
extension for? And do those loans move off the balance sheet and go somewhere else? Just trying to understand
the moving parts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. The ones for short-term extension is generally we're transitioning out to end financing. That's probably
going to be off our balance sheet. And that's pretty typical. The history of payoffs is pretty substantial in terms of
what we see every quarter just rolling off. So there's lot of construction financing that we do that we're not going to
be the best scenario for them in the long term. So that's kind of how that works. And we still see lots of liquidity
out in that end market.
As it relates to the other part of the question, which is what are we looking for, typically, what triggers that
conversation is really going to be performance of the underlying property, which is really our primary focus. You
have lease income that you're matching up against your expenses and your debt service. And if there is a
mismatch there, we're going to have a conversation.
And generally speaking, I think most of our borrowers will still tell you that they believe strongly in their project and
property, and they want to support it. I mean, generally, those conversations at this point are still very productive.
And then we do have situations where in this loan sale where we had conversations and you could see that it
probably was not going to get better. And at that point in time, we have to make a decision as to do we – because
of there's so much liquidity still in the market, this was an opportune time to just say the situation is probably not
going to get any better and we need to probably think about some alternatives.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And you did mention that you're still seeing a lot of liquidity in that
end market. Is that for a wide range of projects or is it, I guess, more tailored to specific asset classes [ph] within
(00:47:41) construction where there's available liquidity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah, that's a good point. If it's multifamily, that's industrial. There's a lot of appetite still out there for that type of
product. Obviously, in some of these more distressed areas like CRE and retail, that's a different story altogether.
But we don't do a lot of the construction financing in those segments. So, generally speaking, we're looking to just
transition loans out for end financing. We've been really focused heavily on more multifamily and industrial over
the past three or four years.

Got it. And I know it was a smaller amount of loans and it was [indiscernible] (00:48:29). It was a relatively small
charge. But if I – did I hear you right and read right, I guess, that the $8 million charge that you took against $17
million of coworking office loans, was that an $8 million charge on a $17 million loan portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
That's correct. It was a small group of properties. No one market in particular. But they were all thinking – as I
said, the common denominator is that coworking space, which we think is probably going to be the last piece to
recover in office and probably the hardest to kind of retenant at this point. So as we had said in the past, we try to
be really strategic in terms of taking advantage of the liquidity, and albeit there's probably less liquidity for this
type of product out there and that's why the discount. But it's better off just get the runway clear because we're not
sure what's coming down the road, but we want to be prepared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. No, I understand that. And so you don't think that that level of charge is indicative of what you might see if
you or other banks maybe had to sell what I would call a more regular way kind of normal office property?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, no, not at all. I mean, again, in the coworking space, which we have very little of, and this was almost half of
that total that we have, it's a much more distressed subsegment of this office category. So we think that you're
probably going to see a little more stress in that subcategory. But in general, we're still pretty confident about
where valuations are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then, just one last one for me, just on the loan sale within the commercial finance – premium finance
portfolio. Who are the end buyers of these? You don't need to give a name, obviously, but just like a type. Is it
private equity? Like who are the end buyers of this loan – in this type of loan portfolio? And I think you mentioned
that this kind of gives you the opportunity to explore other types of these transactions down the road. What would
drive you to kind of look to lean into selling more of these loans versus keeping them on balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we sold in a special purpose vehicle that then sells it out the asset conduits that are investing. So,
yeah, we're not going to give the name right now as we have an NDA, but it's your standard financial institution
conduit financing. So again, we didn't have to do it if we didn't sell it off to some of these firms that are buying
distressed assets. Obviously, this is not a distressed portfolio. We have no reason to do that. This was more
testing the plumbing and getting a setup to provide a lever to pull for liquidity if we need it.
So, I think the reason you would do it again is, if loan growth was very, very strong and you needed to fund it and
the deposit growth wasn't as quick, again as Tim says, we much prefer to grow our franchise. We've always done
that to grow the franchise through deposits which is the core business that we love. But to the extent that the
asset growth would outstrip the deposit growth in any given quarter, we could pull the lever on this either as a
19

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
distinct sale like we did this time or you could also set up a similar transaction where it's a revolving securitization
facility where you could just continue to feed it into.
We're not as favorable of studying that, because generally you'd want to set it up for a two- or three-year time
period at least. And your crystal ball isn't always so clear as how strong loan demand will be three years out. So,
we'd rather do it discreetly and kind of bespoke sort of transactions as needed. But right now, we don't anticipate
doing it again in the future. But if we did it again, it's probably a good thing because that means we're having
really, really good loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I think I heard you right that you're going to continue to service these loans for those borrowers, but
they are pretty short term. So, is there much in the way of servicing income that will come from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, no. They're very short term and the servicing costs are pretty low in this portfolio.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
No, I don't think there's necessarily any color that I could give you on that. I mean, the levels are still very
subdued in terms of overall. But in terms of driving changes in the CECL, I don't know if it really had a whole lot of
– yeah, so I'm just kind of taking a look at it.
Yeah. And we're at 1% still. So, I mean as it relates to overall levels, I think we're still in pretty good shape kind of
looking at my list of additions to it. And there are a lot of common denominators here. We try to be incredibly
proactive in our portfolio reviews of identifying any type of loan that might be – in the series up to the segment, for
instance, where you have decline in debt service coverage that gets a little bit closer to 1 to 1; or at 1 to 1, that's
going to be something. So, we see obviously some of that.
There's also – as a commercial customer is compressed a little bit in cash flow, we might make that as
substandard. And typically, we're going to anticipate that that's going to turn around. So, there's no one thing I can
point to, but just certainly higher borrowing costs probably would be the primary driver of that as it puts a little
more strain on cash flow, both in the C&I and CRE segment. But as it relates to CECL, I mean, not a whole – I
think as Dave pointed out earlier, I think the bigger drivers on CECL is really going to be in some of these
economic factors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's more a function of just our very proactive approach to reviewing these credits and making sure
we understand where everything is. Again, they remain at a very low level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

were talking about kind of a high-single digit outlook for this year. Does that still kind of hold?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think it does. I mean, you got a – if you factor out the impact of the acquisitions we've always had, that's
excluding acquisitions. But yeah, I think that still holds. So this quarter, I've talked about the reasons for this
quarter. But yeah, I think we still look at that as being appropriate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. And just one last housekeeping question. With the sale of some MSRs in the quarter, did that impact
mortgage revenue in any way materially in 2Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. We took an opportunity. We always mark the MSRs to market. And we had – the market value of them at the
end of last quarter when we started to look at this transaction when we actually sold them this quarter were
roughly the same. So there wasn't a big impact. That was really just reducing risk again.
MSRs had run up nicely and did take a little bit of that asset off of our books at sort of the top of the MSR
valuation, as we look at it seemed to be prudent. And the loan – the servicing rights that we sold were generally

those loans that were outside of the Chicago and Milwaukee market area. So they weren't our banking customers.
They were loans that we'd made in other regions of the United States.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That does make sense. If I could just ask one more on capital. Total risk-based was down to 11.9%. I know
you guys tend to want to stay above 11.5%, but I imagine with the – I'm sorry, the insurance premium finance
securitization that's upcoming and just given perhaps higher for longer interest rate environment that you guys
have plenty of capital to just kind of continue support the growth opportunities that exist organically in front of you
today. Is that the right way to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. Yeah, we think so, Nate. I mean, obviously, this was a big growth quarter, and the sale occurred after the
quarter end. So we feel comfortable. And if loan growth normalizes into the range Rich discussed, we should be
adding capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. And the other thing that happened, the other capital ratio stayed relatively flat. Total risk-based was down a
little bit because, as you know, we had a sub-debt offering out there that – sub-debt, you lose 20% of it each year
as it matured and the last 20% of that sub-debt capital ran off on June 30. So that impacted the total risk-based
capital just a little bit. But clearly, we expect the capital ratios to grow going forward based upon our projected
earnings and balance sheet growth.

Got it. And it sounds like the priorities for excess capital deployment are still organic growth first. Perhaps
buybacks or lower down on the spectrum, just given the organic growth opportunities today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. I think that's fair, Nate. I mean, obviously, we look at all the alternatives. But again, we anticipate good
growth. We like where we are in the market.

Nathan J. Race Q

Okay. Great. I appreciate all the color and taking the questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

You bet. Thank you. Have a good day.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q

Thanks. Good morning.

Morning, Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Just wanted to check back in on the hedging strategy on margin. Appreciate the guidance, the 3.60% to 3.70% for
the back half of the year. I guess, what's the duration of those hedges? I think in early parts of the year, you talked
about maybe taking the top end off of 4%-plus, but also protecting much below 3.50%. I guess, does that extend
into 2024, basically, what you've hedged in? And I guess how does that range get affected further out kind of with
another hike, no hikes or kind of a cut? I'm just trying to think of that duration of those hedges. Does that get into
2024 or any early expectations to how margin behaves into 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. No, yeah. When we did those hedges, they were generally longer-term transaction. So on slide 22 of our
earnings deck or you can look in the last 10-Q that we had, the maturity dates range from September of 2025 all
the way out into 2028. So they are longer-term hedges. And if you look at that slide, it's got the swap rates and I'm
– which are generally from the mid-3s into the low 4% range as far as where the swap rates are at.
So we – in the market, given the slope of the curve, it just hasn't been that favorable from our perspective to enter
into more, so we haven't. We didn't enter into any in the second quarter. We'll still look at that. But they're there
for downside protection. And quite frankly, as I said in my comments, had it not been for this portfolio, our margin
– if we didn't put the swaps in, our margin would be 15 basis points higher overall because that's the impact this
quarter. Last quarter, the impact was 7 basis points. So the differential this quarter was 8 basis points. First
quarter, the impact was 7 basis points; this quarter was 15 basis points. So the differential was 8 basis points.
But we think that's a fair price to pay if we can keep the margin relatively stable like we think it is to protect from
the downside risk of a substantial rate reduction. So just the risk mitigation again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. But not...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
No longer term.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
All right. So not to sort of extend that guidance range into 2024, but you feel pretty good about kind of maintaining
that level even beyond into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Well, it depends. I mean, everybody's view is different. If you take the higher for longer, then I think that bodes
well for us. If you look at the curve and rates drop precipitously, then we probably would have some pressure on
our margin. But that's why we have these hedges in place to help mitigate some of that impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's helpful just to see where you lean into that. Just the last one would be just checking in on wealth
management. I think the acquisition sort of juiced that number a bit. But looking forward to the outlook, would you
expect that growth to level off? Linked quarter was strong, but maybe acquisition-driven...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
That was acquisition-driven. So we would expect to continue to grow it, but it would just be slow, steady growth.
And some of that is obviously dependent on the market because you earn your fees based on the underlying
asset value. So if the market continues to rally, then that would be beneficial for us.

Operator: We have a question from the line of Brody Preston with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Sorry about that. I just wanted to clarify something on the coworking space. Is that like a WeWork? I
just wanted to make sure I totally understood what the property was.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah, kind of WeWork light. It's just where – I think there was a move for a while there where people thought they
could get me a significantly higher lease rate by going short term on their leases. And that works when the market
is hot, but doesn't when it's cold.
