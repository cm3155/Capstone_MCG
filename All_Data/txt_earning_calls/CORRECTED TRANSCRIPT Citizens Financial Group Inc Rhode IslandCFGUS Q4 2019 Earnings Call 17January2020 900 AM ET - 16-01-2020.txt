Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: And good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full
Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on the call today. Currently all
participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer
session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ellen A. Taylor
Head of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hey. Thanks, Brad. And happy new decade to everyone. We're really pleased to have you join us. First, this
morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce van Saun and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our results
and our outlook. And we'll reference our presentation which you can find at investor.citizensbank.com. And then
we'll be happy to take questions. I'd also like to mention that Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don
McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are here to help us with that.
And now for some additional quick housekeeping. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements
which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And you should review the factors that may cause our results to differ
materially from the expectations on page 2 of the presentation and in our 2018 Form 10-K. We also utilize non-
GAAP financial measures. So it's important for you to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the presentation, and
to utilize the information about these measures and our reconciliation to GAAP in the appendix.
And now I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to announce
another strong quarter today. In spite of continuing interest rate and yield curve headwinds, we've been able to
maintain stable revenue as strong results in our fee businesses and attractive loan growth have worked to offset
pressure on our net interest margin. For the full year, we grew our earnings per share by 8%, and we hit most of
our guidance for 2019 even though the interest rate yield curve environment turned out much different than we
had assumed. We continue to demonstrate strong expense discipline, good performance on credit, and robust
capital return.
As we look back on 2019, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in building a great bank, regaining
customers and market share in both Commercial and Consumer given our focus on being a trusted advisor and
delivering an excellent customer experience. The investments we've made in technology are paying dividends,
witnessed our success with Citizens Access, over 20 fintech partnerships, and the rollout of several new core
platforms. We've attracted great talent. We've built a collegial customer-focused culture, and we've developed
strong leaders. The development of an exciting TOP 6 program along with several big strategic initiatives
designed to grow medium-term revenues, and renewed vigor around our balance sheet optimization effort give us
a great underpinning for success in 2020 and beyond.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Looking out at 2020, we anticipate that we will have a moderately good economic backdrop. We anticipate loan
and deposit growth relatively consistent with this year, which will offset the impact on NIM of the Fed's 2019 rate
cuts. We see a stable to modest rise in NIM over the course of the year starting in Q1. Our fee growth should
continue to outpace peers given the investments we've made and our expanding customer base. And while we
continue to make growth investments, we nonetheless are targeting a modest level of positive operating leverage.
And credit should stay in good shape though CECL introduces some new wrinkles that John will cover in a few
minutes. So to summarize, we're pleased with our progress in 2019, and we're excited to start the New Year with
all its hope and all its promise.
Before I turn it over to our CFO John Woods, I would like to note that this will be the last earnings call for our Vice
Chairman of Consumer, Brad Conner. Brad has been a great partner and has done a terrific job in positioning our
consumer bank for future success, and we wish him well in retirement. We were pleased to be able to promote
from within to fill the leadership going forward, a sign of the strong talent we've assembled at Citizens.
With that, over to you, John.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Great. And thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report solid results this quarter and a
strong finish to the year with record fee income, good expense discipline, and steady execution against our
strategic initiatives. We are well-positioned for a successful 2020 given our consistent track record of disciplined
execution. Let me kick off by covering important highlights of our underlying results covered on pages 5 through
7. For the full year, our EPS was up 8% with PPNR up 6% despite a challenging yield curve backdrop. A key
driver was fee income growth of 17% with record results across each of our major fee income businesses as
we've continued to expand our capabilities organically and through disciplined strategic acquisitions.
We also continued to maintain good underlying expense discipline. We leveraged the benefits of our top
programs to fund investments to drive future revenue growth. For the quarter, EPS growth was up 1% year-over-
year. This reflects relatively stable net interest income, as 4% interest-earning asset growth helped offset the
impact of a decline in net interest margin. We also generated record fee income in the fourth quarter of nearly
$500 million, up 16% year-over-year highlighted by continued strength in mortgage and wealth, and record
revenues in capital markets and FX and IRP. We continue to strengthen and diversify our business model and the
results are evident. We delivered strong deposit growth of 7% year-over-year with growth across all categories.
Our spot LDR was 95%, leaving us well positioned as we enter 2020.
On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was relatively stable with good loan growth in the quarter and
decelerating pressure on margin. Importantly, we continue to manage our deposit costs well bringing interest-
bearing deposit costs down to 15 basis points during the quarter. We remain highly disciplined on expenses and
continue to execute extremely well in our TOP programs. We delivered pre-tax run rate benefits of about $125
million for TOP 5, which is above our initial estimates for the program. And our transformational TOP 6 program is
well underway with a target of approximately $300 million to $325 million in pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of
2021. I'll spend a few minutes on that and some of our strategic revenue initiatives shortly. Overall credit quality
remains strong across retail and commercial, and both the nonperforming loan ratio and the allowance coverage
ratio showed nice improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. We delivered ROTCE of 12.5% and tangible
book value per share was up 12% year-over-year to $32.08.
On page 8, net interest income was relatively stable linked quarter as a pick-up in loan growth offset a 6 basis
point decrease in net interest margin. This reflects the impact of lower rates and higher prepayments on asset

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
yields, partially offset by the benefit of improved asset mix and deposit pricing discipline. On a year-over-year
basis, net interest income was down 2% as our loan growth of 3% helped to largely offset the impact of a 19-basis
point decline in net interest margin to 3.06% given rates. On a positive note, we lowered funding costs by 7 basis
points reflecting the improved funding mix from deposit growth and the benefit of lower rates. In the face of the
shifting rate environment and related balance sheet dynamics, we are actively managing our asset sensitivity
which remained broadly stable at around a 3% impact to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates with about 75% of
this exposure tied to longer rates.
Moving to fees on slide 9, our fee-based businesses continued to perform very well, reflecting the significant
progress we are making in strengthening and expanding our capabilities, which is helping to further diversify our
revenue. This includes our mortgage banking and wealth management businesses on the consumer side and
capital and global markets in commercial. Non-interest income hit record levels at nearly $500 million for the
quarter, and was up 16% year-over-year as our fee income ratio improved 3.5 points to 30%. Non-interest income
was relatively stable linked quarter as record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate
products offset lower mortgage banking revenue, which as expected declined from record third quarter levels.
Capital market fees were up $27 million linked quarter as loan syndication fees were higher with strong volumes
leading to a record number of lead-left transactions which increased 11% year-over-year. M&A advisory fees
were also higher, reflecting a strong contribution from Bowstring which we acquired early last year. We also
continue to gain traction in underwriting fees. Foreign exchange and interest rate product revenues also reached
record levels and were up $14 million linked quarter driven by increased client activity as sentiment improved with
these easing trade tensions as well as a benefit from CBA.
Wealth management posted a solid performance with trust and investment services fees up 4% sequentially as
market conditions improved. Mortgage banking fees were lower by $37 million from record third quarter levels,
reflecting the impact of higher long term rates and seasonality on originations, which contributed to a $20 million
reduction in production revenue. In addition, MSR valuation hedging results declined by $21 million from higher
levels in the third quarter. Providing a partial offset in mortgage servicing fees up $4 million driven by growth in
the servicing portfolio which increased by 4% sequentially to over $98 billion, as well as by lower amortization
expense.
Turning to page 10, noninterest expense was down $5 million or 1% linked quarter. Excluding the impact of the
lease transaction in 3Q 2019, noninterest expense was relatively stable and demonstrates our ongoing efforts to
improve efficiency. We continue to utilize savings from our TOP programs to reinvest in revenue generating
opportunities. Salary and employee benefits were down 1% reflecting the impact of our efficiency programs as
well as lower incentive compensation. Outside services expense was up 7% sequentially, largely reflecting the
impact of higher retail loan origination activity and seasonality. Year-over-year, our noninterest expense was up
5% or 4% before the impact of acquisitions reflecting our funding of growth-oriented investments.
Let's move on to page 11 and discuss core loan trends. Average loans were up 1.5% linked quarter with a modest
drag from balance sheet optimization initiatives as we move $1.1 billion of non-relationship mortgage loans to
held-for-sale late in the quarter. Average loans were up 1.8% before the impact of this loan sale activity. On a
linked quarter basis, commercial loans were up 1% as we continue to execute well against our geographic,
product and client-focused expansion strategies, partially offset by planned reductions in commercial leasing.
Retail loans were up 1.7% linked quarter and up 2.4% before the impact of the loan sales activity given growth in
mortgage, education and merchant partnerships. Year-over-year average loans were up 3% and, adjusting for the
impact of loan sales activity, were up 4% with 3% growth in commercial and 5% growth in retail. Overall, period-
end loans were up 1% linked quarter, providing some momentum for first quarter loan growth.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Moving to page 12, we saw nice deposit growth of 1.4% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year as we benefited
from investments we've made over the past several years to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our DDA
growth was 3% on a linked-quarter basis and relatively stable year-over-year, which compares favorably to
industry trends. Additionally, our Citizens Access digital platform, which reached $5.8 billion in deposits at the end
of the quarter, continues to contribute to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit base.
Given the rate environment, we continue to aggressively execute our deposit playbook to manage down our
deposit costs across all channels reducing CD rates, retail market promo rates and taking down the savings rate
in our digital bank. We've also been reducing rates for commercial clients where it makes sense. As a result, our
total deposit costs were well controlled, down 12 basis points linked-quarter, a nice improvement from the 5-
basis-point decrease last quarter. This includes the benefit of interest-bearing deposit costs which were down 15
basis points linked quarter.
Next, let's move to page 13 and cover credit which continues to look quite good overall across retail and
commercial. Non-performing loans decreased 5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year, and the NPL ratio of 59
basis points improved 4 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points year-over-year. Net charge-offs came in at
41 basis points in the quarter, up modestly linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher losses in auto and expected
seasoning in other retail, partially offset by modestly lower commercial losses. Provision for credit losses of $110
million was up from the prior quarter largely driven by continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios. Our
allowance to loans coverage ratio remained relatively stable ending the quarter at 105 basis points, while our NPL
coverage ratio improved to 178%, up from 171% linked quarter and 162% versus a year ago.
On page 14, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10%,
which compares well with peers. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 10.9 million shares of common stock
and, including common dividends, returned 558 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased a total of
34 million shares and, including common dividends, returned $1.84 billion to shareholders, up 23% from 2018.
Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about 35% to 40%.
Let's move to page 15 and discuss CECL. On the slide, we have provided some high-level information about our
methodology and the key macroeconomic variables that are drivers of the outcomes. We still expect the day one
impact of CECL on our reserves will be an increase in the 30% to 35% range, which represents about 22 to 25
basis points on CET1 on a fully phased-in basis, or approximately a 5 to 6-basis-point impact starting in 2020.
This range considers the current economic outlook and mix and credit characteristics of the portfolio. Ultimately,
the amount of the initial impact will reflect our view of the macroeconomic outlook and some fine-tuning of our
reserve models. So we plan to provide you with the final number when we issue our 10-K in February.
Our estimated day two impact results in 2020 provision expense in the range of $475 million to $575 million with
expected charge-offs in the $475 million to $525 million range. Let me note that, under CECL, quarterly volatility
of provision could be potentially higher due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast and the mix of loan growth
and runoff.
On page 16, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our bank. First, Forbes ranked us
second among financial institutions and 16th overall on their 2019 list of America's Best Employers for New
Graduates. We are really proud of that because it shows that we are doing a good job of developing young talent,
and it's a reflection of all the exciting things we are doing as we build a top-performing bank. We also announced

the second year of our Leadership-level national partnership with Feeding America to combat hunger. And this is
just one of the important things we do to help people in the communities we serve.
Since our last call, we have now launched an exciting new merchant partnership program with Microsoft for their
Xbox All Access program, which is distributed through Amazon. We are really excited about this program and our
opportunity to partner with great merchants to help build deep and lasting relationships with our customers. We
are also hitting on all cylinders with the work we've done to expand our fee businesses and build out our
capabilities. We have virtually completed the integration of our Franklin American Mortgage acquisition which
again saw very strong results this quarter with strong originations and improved year-over-year sales margins.
And in the commercial business, we are very happy with our progress moving up the syndication lead tables,
coming in at number three for middle market, and increasing our number of lead-left transactions. We've also
been enhancing our capital and global markets capabilities, building our M&A advisory business and client
hedging capabilities, and both of these businesses saw record results this quarter. Also, in our Treasury Solutions
business this quarter, we completed the client migration to accessOPTIMA, our best-in-class cash management
platform.
On page 17, let me provide you with an update on the progress we're making and our expectations for the TOP 6
program. The TOP programs have been instrumental in driving efficiencies that allow us to self-fund the
investments and continue to deliver future growth. Overall, we expect to deliver $300 million to $325 million in pre-
tax run rate benefits by year-end 2021, with about $175 million to $225 million of that coming by year-end 2020.
Our TOP 6 program consists of two parts, the first being the transformational program, which is designed to
transform how we operate and deliver for our customers and colleagues. I'll give you a few examples of what
we're doing. We aim to deliver a more customer-centric, efficient and agile environment by modernizing our IT
practices and our cross-organization operating model. This IT work will further modernize our infrastructure and
platforms and transform our technology delivery approach.
We are accelerating migration to the cloud, utilizing data and Artificial Intelligence more ambitiously, and digitizing
end-to-end processes. We are converting ourselves to an agile company over the next 12 to 18 months. This will
make a huge difference in terms of the speed to market for everything we do and will significantly enhance our
ability to innovate, adapt, and deliver for customers.
The second part of the TOP 6 program is a more traditional improvement program similar to those that we've
successfully executed over the last five years. On the efficiency side, we are accelerating our retail network
transformation, modernizing our branches, and rationalizing our footprint to better serve and advise customers.
We are looking at ways to simplify our organizational and improve the way our back office operations support the
business and work more efficiently.
Cost to implement the program are estimated to increase to approximately $75 million over the course of the year,
so we will look for strategy to offset these notable items as we've done in the past. Importantly, the benefits of
TOP 6 will have to mitigate the impact of the rate environment and ensure we maintain our commitment to
delivering operating leverage and improving our efficiency and the way we run the bank.
Moving to page 18, we expect to utilize some savings from the TOP program to fund the strategic revenue
opportunities we are going after. For example, we are looking to significantly expand digital strategies across the
bank to reach more customers. We plan to expand the products that offer through Citizens Access to further

extend our national reach beyond our branch footprint. Our first wave of additional products should launch by late
this year.
We are also planning to launch a new commercial customer digital offering. We envision developing a simple,
integrated self-service and fully digital platform to serve small businesses and lower middle market customers
with tools to help them run their businesses better and enable frictionless deposit and lending capabilities.
Another example is our effort to leverage the success we've had with our merchant finance partnerships to
enhance the payment experience at point-of-sale while helping customers responsibly make larger ticket
purchases. Taken together, these revenue opportunities would require roughly $40 million investment in 2020,
about 70% of which would be in CapEx. If executed well, the investment should really benefit our medium-term
revenue growth and provide about a 1% booster ROTCE by 2024.
Moving to page 19, looking ahead, we are very optimistic about the coming year and the opportunity we have to
continue building a top-performing bank that delivers for all stakeholders. The capabilities we have built and that
have delivered success from the IPO up till now give us the confidence that we can sustain our progress into the
future. We have a strong customer-focused culture and an experienced board and management team. We have a
proven ability to execute and a commitment to excellence that will propel us going forward.
Additionally, we have demonstrated strong execution on our enterprise initiatives such as our TOP programs
which are quite differentiating and demonstrates a mindset of continuous improvement. We also have made good
progress on balance sheet optimization as we have developed initiatives for both sides of the balance sheet to
further build capabilities and optimize our position.
We also continue to make important investments in our future. We're thinking about the long-term, making good
decisions about how to prioritize where we spend money and balancing that with the need to deliver progress
near term. As we look out into the medium-term, we remain committed to our ROTCE target of 14% to 16%, the
details in the appendix. Clearly, we've had to contend with the changed rate environment, so it's taking longer, but
we remain confident in our ability to deliver given a reasonable environment.
On page 20, we review our 2019 performance against the guidance we provided at the start of the year. And
despite a pretty dramatic shift in the rate environment from the beginning of the year, we executed well across our
targets and delivered overall in the bottom line. Keys to this overall performance were delivering strong fee
revenue, reflecting our initiatives to expand fee-based capabilities, delivering solid loan growth in areas with
attractive risk-adjusted return profiles, and maintaining strong expense discipline and stable credit quality, all
while returning significant capital to shareholders.
Now, turning to our outlook for 2020 on page 21. We expect modest NII growth of around 1% to 2% as the benefit
of 3% to 4% loan growth is partially offset by the impact of lower rates relative to a year ago. Given our current
expectation for the Fed to remain on hold through the end of the year, we expect net interest margin to be down in
line with 2019 results as pressure on loan yields is partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing.
We expect to continue to leverage our more diversified business model and enhance capabilities to deliver non-
interest income growth in the range of 4% to 5.5%. We also will target modest positive operating leverage in the
50 basis points range and a stable efficiency ratio by maintaining good expense discipline while continuing to
make important investments to drive future revenue growth.

We expect underlying credit quality to remain well-controlled and we currently expect provision expense under
CECL to be in the range of $475 million to $575 million with charge-off in the range of $475 million to $525 million.
We expect our CET1 to end the year in the 9.75% to 10% range with a dividend payout ratio towards the upper
end of our 35% to 40% target. Let me note that this outlook does not include notable items. We expect those
costs to be in the range of approximately $75 million over the course of the year.
Our outlook for the first quarter on page 22 reflects historical seasonality for first quarter revenues and expenses.
We are expecting net interest income to be up slightly as loan growth and a stable to slightly up net interest
margin are partially offset by a $10 million impact from day count.
The fee income outlook for the quarter reflects seasonal trends resulting in a mid-single digit increase from strong
fourth quarter levels. That said, pipelines in our fee businesses look good early in the quarter. Non-interest
expense is expected to be up in the low single digits, largely given seasonal payroll tax and compensation
impacts. The provision is expected to be modestly higher in the $115 million to $120 million range. Finally, we
expect the tax rate to remain stable around the 22% level and for the CET1 ratio to end the first quarter at around
10%.
To sum up, on page 24, our results this quarter demonstrate our continued strong performance as we execute
against our strategic initiatives, grow customers and revenues, carefully manage our expense base, deploy new
technologies and improve how we run the bank.
Now, let me turn it back to Bruce.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
The revenue outlook seems little bit better than expected and better than some peers. Obviously fees is a big
component of that. Could you just elaborate a bit on the drivers of fees? You had a very good fourth quarter in
cap markets, mortgage, the rates, FX, but talk about the kind of drivers on a full-year basis and why you're
confident in that high fee revenue growth. Thank you.

...and then, I'll kind of pass to you. But you know, Matt, I think it's been a journey here on investing in our fee
businesses and building out our capabilities and we have a growing customer base. We're growing households on
the Consumer side and we've – up the number of accounts and clients we service on the Commercial side. So,
making that all kind of work in harmony so that those expanded capabilities can get delivered as we become a
trusted advisor and provide advice to our customers.
We're really starting to see the fruits of that. So, you could see that hit and accelerate as we go through 2019. And
I think as we look into 2020, there's more juice in the lemons, so to speak, to squeeze on that. So, with that
overview, why don't I give it to John and then maybe Don and Brad, you could comment on each of your
businesses?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that's well said, Bruce. I'd say the outlook for 2020, if you start looking forward, you'd see our
expected strength in both businesses and Don and Brad will comment. But capital markets, for example, is an
area of ongoing strength. We've been making investments and capabilities there. I think there's a balance and this
is a little bit of a theme of organic investments being combined with the synergies from small bolt-on acquisitions
that we've done over the last couple of years. And that's evident in the M&A advisory space within cap markets
going forward. We've made lots of organic investments in the global market space and we've had some record
results here recently. I think two quarters in a row in IRP.
On the Consumer side, I'd say that mortgage and wealth are the two areas that I would point to, solid, expected
underpinning in mortgage going forward given, that helps to diversify some of our fee businesses. And then in
wealth, the ongoing integration of Clarfeld and the synergies there, combined with the investments in the FA
advisor space. I mean, our FA advisors were up 4% over the year and as that the full-year effect of that as you
get into 2020 and the productivity that you expect in that sales force looks good along with, maybe a more
constructive mid to long-term rate environment which will help to relieve some of the pressure on some of the
transaction revenues we have in the wealth space looking forward. So, all in, we feel pretty good about the
outlook for 2020 on fees.

Don, you want to go on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I'll just amplify a little bit. I think John and Bruce covered a lot of it. But the other thing that I focus on is
share gains. We are, as John said, moving up the league tables nicely and all the relative league tables which
says, even in a market that was a little bit quiet like the syndicated loan market to a large part of the year, we
captured more than our share when we're right up there with the big money centers at this point in that sector.
Second thing I'd just point to is diversification. We've really diversified out our fee stream. So, if you look back
three or four years ago, it was really a syndicated loan story on the capital market side. We've built a nice, a
couple of nice equity partnerships. We've built a high yield business out. And when different markets are
accelerating, we're able to generate revenues. And the third thing is, we've just hired a lot of extremely strong
people on the origination and corporate finance side.
And I think we're pitching really well in the marketplace and we're winning more than our fair share of business.
So, I feel very good about where the business stands. And as John said, I sit here today, our pipelines look a lot
better today than they did a year ago. So, we're entering the year quite strongly.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Yeah. Again, I think you both did a nice job of teeing it up, just a couple of things to add. I agree completely with
what John said on the wealth side. I think we have a significant opportunity to leverage the Clarfeld acquisition in
2020. We had good progress in 2019. A lot of that effort was around the integration work and building the right
foundation. I think we're really ready to leverage and launch that platform in 2020, and feel really good about
where we stand, the integration and the capability we now have to serve the high net worth and ultra-high net
worth business.
And on the mortgage side, certainly we may see the refi activity come down just a little bit in 2020, but we really
think we can overcome that with significant opportunity in our third-party business. As we've been investing, one
of the things that Franklin American gave us was a diversified origination platform where we now have wholesale,
correspondent and retail capabilities. And we've been making significant investments in all of those businesses
around making the experience better, investing in digital capabilities, and we really believe that we're ready to
launch those capabilities particularly on the wholesale and correspondent side. So, I feel very optimistic on the
mortgage front.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys, on the loan growth side, it looks really good, especially, even on Commercial in light of the industry
numbers that obviously don't look anywhere near as good. And I know you talked about balance sheet
optimization continuing underneath. Just wondering just how much do you see still when the uptake of your recent
adds and your vertical expansions and what are you just seeing on the customer demand side underneath that to
continue to propel, especially on the C&I side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, why don't I take that? I think it's a tricky environment out there just because competition is really heavy
and there's not a lot of huge demand for new money. Now, with the trade, first phase behind us, I'm sensing
already a little bit of more optimism in the client base, but it's way too early to really see it translate into the
numbers. I will say that our pipelines – our originations and our pipeline for originations were as strong as they
have ever been last year. They were offset by a lot of paydowns.
So, you saw a lot of working capital efficiency in the form of borrowers and you saw quite a bit of refinancing into
the public markets and in the institutional market. So, there's lots of puts and takes in terms of loan growth. What
we are benefiting from is our geographic expansions. We moved into the Southeast. This last year, we moved into
Texas and California. So, we are adding new clients and that is generating an element of our loan growth.
I would say, our core middle market has been relatively flattish and we expect it to stay relatively flattish. So, as
we kind of go through day-to-day, it's really picking and choosing our spots, making sure we contain credit quality,
making sure we actually earn adequate returns on the capital we're deploying. But we actually like the volume that
we're seeing. So, I think our projection for this year is like low single-digit loan growth.
I will say that if you look in the underlying numbers, we had quite a strong CRE growth last year that was due to
several large transactions at the end of the year which were purpose-built transactions for large corporates which
popped our numbers a little bit and made our CRE growth look a little higher than we had expected it to be when
we're sitting here mid-year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go and jump in there, and I'd say it this way. I mean, I think there – we've seen really strong deposit
growth. I should hasten to add that we're really proud of not only Citizens Access, but also all of the organic work
that's going on in the businesses to drive DDA and other low-cost deposits. I think that's been an area of real
benefit for us over the last several quarters and that continues. So, that's very helpful.
In terms of the – you saw our interest-bearing deposit costs down by 15 basis points this quarter. You're just really
starting to see the impacts of those rate cuts being – takes a little bit of a lag to see that kick in. I would say that
we would expect to see continuing prices for deposit pricing come down as you look into the first half of 2020. As
you get out into later in 2020, you could see some of that dissipate, but we still see pricing opportunities as you
look across not only our branch footprint, but also with respect to online pricing as you head into the early part of
2020.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'm sorry, could you repeat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The question is, consumer loan growth has been relatively strong in the second half of the year. Do we expect
strong loan growth as we go into 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start off on that, and Bruce can add color. But I'd say it this way. More broadly, we feel
pretty good about the balanced profile of our loan growth into 2020 on both the Commercial and Consumer or
retail side of things. And I think that's been a strength of ours more recently which we were underweight in the
Commercial side. And I think that'll help us as across varying environments.
With respect to Consumer, specifically within Consumer, again, diversification is a good story there. We see some
strength in the resi side in the past and we see that continuing into 2020. But from a balance sheet optimization
standpoint, we see some of those portfolios that we really like from a risk-return standpoint such as education and
some of our merchant businesses really helping to drive some uptake over the next year as well. And I should
hasten to add that that helps balance exposure from a CECL standpoint also. So, it just looks to be relatively good
momentum on both sides of the ledger there. And I'll stop there and see if Brad wants to [ph] add on, please.
(00:38:48).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad L. Conner A
Vice Chairman-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. What I would add there, I think, is where you started, John, which is, it's well balanced and we're seeing
relatively strong demand across almost all the asset classes. I mean, you look at the fourth quarter, we had good
demand on the home lending side. Overall, their education refinance product was strong. We're seeing really
good momentum on the merchant side. We've talked about this a couple of times already, but the consumer just
appears to be strong and we're just seeing the demand. I mean, we've talked about running down our auto book
which we have done intentionally, but even there, we're seeing that become a little bit more attractive asset class
as you're starting to see margins widen out a little bit. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
... where we would expect to see growth. And it's very attractive from a risk-adjusted return standpoint. We have
made investments in our card business, so I think we'll see some growth in card as well. In mortgage, we're [ph] –
and I have – note to sell (00:39:52) that we've just announced that we're going to try to call thin-relationship
mortgages and recycle that capital.
So, we've done some of that with auto. We'll do some of that in mortgage. We're still fighting the trends in
HELOC, so we still have a little bit of drag there. So, there's a few things that are going to be working against us,
but I think on a net basis, we'll still have solid outlook for consumer loan growth in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's very helpful. The 2020 margin outlook of stable to slightly up versus fourth quarter, I guess, that's
assuming no rate cuts in 2020. And the question is, what if the Fed does cut rates and just put some of the puts
and takes to the margin outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and cover that. I'd say, as you mentioned, the outlook for NIM is to be up slightly given a
couple of things. I mean, we're seeing some stabilization on the loan front. I mean, we've had a lot of pressure on
loan yields as the industry has and we see that stabilizing in the first quarter. Nevertheless, we still think, as I
mentioned earlier, that we'll see some benefit from deposit costs declining. That, along with the issue of day count
when you go from 4Q to 1Q, all of that would lead to uplift in the first quarter with respect to NIM. And we think
that that can hold and possibly even kind of show some opportunities for improvement thereafter within 2020.
Now, that said, to the extent that there's a rate cut, I mean, we still are asset sensitive and positively. And so,
therefore, that asset sensitivity is around 3%, as I mentioned in my remarks. And so, we would have some
negative impact to that and we tend to manage that through some of the hedging that we've done and what have
you.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Yeah. And I would just add, Peter, that the markets are not looking for any further reductions for some time. And I
think all of the public commentary by Fed officials is that they've eased and created looser conditions, monetary
conditions, and they want to wait and see how that affects the economy and the data. So I think we're in the clear
for a reasonable period of time before we really have to worry about whether there needs to be further reductions.
I personally think that, if the economy picks up some steam here because of some of those easings and because
some of the macro overhangs like trade tension and what's going to happen with Brexit as those things have
eased, to me, there's probably more of a upside breakout bias here than downside as we look in 2020. All things
considered. And so, our feeling is that the next move might be up if we're at these very tight unemployment levels
and inflation is starting to trickle up. You could see a scenario where the Fed pauses and stays on hold for a long
time, but then ultimately feels the need to do some retracement up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I was just going to add one other point, with respect to a few quarters ago, we shifted our asset
sensitivity to the longer end in an environment where we think steepening is – we have a bias towards steepening
of the curve as well. And so, that to me is an important mitigant to any environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I think historically when you've seen the Fed go on pause, the [ph] 2s-to-10 (00:43:42) spread has steepened
usually in the range of 50 basis points. And so, we're still roughly at half of that and certainly that would create a
little kick here to NII.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
I think I just wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the digital offerings in Citizens Access. So, as you get more
time under your belt and the volume continues to grow, what are you finding about the elasticity or price sensitivity
of that customer as time marches on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'll go and just – I'll kick off there. I mean, I think we've seen – the betas in that space are pretty typical, something
in the neighborhood of 60% to 70% on the way up. We've been able to retrace that as rates have come down. I
think more broadly, though, as we mentioned before, this has been a homerun for us in terms of diversifying our
funding sources. And the pricing of it actually has been accretive to our NIM.
With respect to being much better able to optimize our pricing, our promotional approaches to focusing on deposit
primacy and et cetera within the branch footprint. So, going forward, we feel like there's pretty good pricing power
there. But the whole point of that platform is more of a strategic deepening with a customer segment that we find
really attractive. And as we mentioned in some of our remarks, we plan to add to that platform later this year and
are excited about broadening our approach to that customer segment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think, extremely well said. I think we've learned that the betas behaved the way we would have hoped on
the way up. And, yeah, there is an affinity of these customers to the customer experience that we're providing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad L. Conner A
Vice Chairman-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And we're finding that they're quite sticky when we raise rates as rates – excuse me, lower rates as rates come
down. So, yeah, we feel quite good about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I was going to add that as well, Brad, that I think we spend a lot of time designing the experience.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And making it really terrific for folks. And so, as long as we're paying competitive rates, I think there's no reason
really for them to switch. And then, if we can come along with these rollout of additional products and have even
deeper relationships that makes it even more sticky as time goes by.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, maybe John, if you could expand upon a couple of your comments
regarding rate sensitivity, I know you guys have taken some efforts over the last few quarters to moderate the
level of asset sensitivity to where you are now. I guess, I'm curious for any updated thoughts on what the end
game would be for in sort of stable rate environment. Do we want to neutralize the sensitivity or maintain some
modest level of asset sensitivity? How are you thinking about that dynamic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think as you heard it earlier, I mean, we have a bias that the Fed is likely on hold here and a bias
towards the fact that there's some steepening potential in the yield curve that particularly given the recent events
on trade and other factors in the macro. So, all of that said, I think a low to moderate asset sensitivity position is a
more durable expectation going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we shift some of our asset sensitivity out to the
longer end. So now, we're call it in the 75% range of our 3% sensitivity is really tied to longer rates and so little bit
less volatility with respect to the moves on the short end. So we think that's the appropriate positioning and I think
that'll serve us well to manage the [indiscernible] (00:47:57) issues going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And one thing, Scott, is that we are constantly running simulations and calibrating what the market expectations
are and making adjustments to those hedges on a regular basis. So, we feel good about the kind of quality of
analytics and the people we have running those analytics. And you have to start with a view, as John said, and
then you tail your position there. But we're constantly looking at well, what if we're wrong and what if this happens
that we covered off different scenarios. So feel good about the capabilities we have there.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, the company has outperformed those results and outlook and it's clearly reflected on the stock price
performance. I thought it was interesting that you've reiterated once again your medium-term ROTCE of 14% to
16%. Consensus for both 2020 and 2021 has ROTCE of – in the low 12%. And I'm wondering, Bruce and John, if
you could help us with a walk in terms of getting from – to your medium term of 14% from the 12.8%. In another
words, what is consensus missing in that – they don't have even approaching that range over the next two years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Well, let me start John, and then you can pick up. But one thing Erika that we like to highlight in the release
is the fact that with the change in rates we've had an increase in the value of our securities portfolio, which is a
good thing when it comes to book value per share, but it raises your overall equity. And so the impact of that was
85 basis points from where we ended up Q4 to where we were Q4 of 2018. So one of the things that could really
help propel us back towards the 14%, which we had briefly touched in Q4 of 2018 was, it would be a steepening
in the curve. And I don't think analyst consensus, I don't think people really go and model that and carry it through
to what the impacts could be on OCI. So there's that element that I would just kind of lead off with and say, if we
got in a rate environment where the curve started to steepen and the economy stayed strong next year, that
would certainly help propel us higher.
I think beyond that then, it really boils down to continuing to deliver that positive operating leverage. And in a way,
I would say, if you think about 2020, we're still going through a period of transition to deal with the impacts of the
Fed moves in 2019, and they'll have an impact as you can see in the guidance. And so you won't have as much
operating leverage as you've had in the past. You'll have to fight the tape a little bit on NIM. So earnings per share
growth won't be as much as it's been historically. But to me, 2020 is a really, really important year because we
have teed up some very significant efforts. We have top six and that positions us really well for the future in terms
of how we deliver technology and serve customers and run the bank more efficiently.
And with that, we have identified some really great opportunities we think that we can build on capabilities we
have, and really start to invest in these three strategic initiatives which are outlined in the deck, which I think were
duly cautious on how long it's going to take to build those businesses and scale those businesses, and we say
that you look out in the medium term and there's a 1% boost to our ROTCE coming from those initiatives. And
we'll work really hard to do everything we can to try to accelerate that. So I think 2021, if we execute well through
2020, I think there's a fair amount of upside too if you're in a constructive environment. And we've pulled through
the top programs. We've got some oomph behind these strategic initiatives that we could set up ourselves very
well to get back to something where there's more operating leverage and a more rigorous rate of EPS growth. So
anyway, I'll stop there, and John you can add to that.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. No, that is well said. I'd say just, Erika, in terms of puts and takes on that, I mean, I think when we look out
into the future, we see opportunity for ROTCE expansion in a number of areas just to list a couple. Certainly in the
NII space, the way that we're growing the balance sheet and how we're going to use balance sheet optimization
with more momentum there frankly to really drive ROTCE uptake, I think is a real opportunity. You heard about
TOP. I think our TOP program, I think, is differentiating. It's driving ROTCE improvement. We're going to invest
some of that in the strategic initiatives which will also be, as we mentioned, possibly a point of ROTCE over the
medium term. And Bruce mentioned the denominator OCI and capital-related items that will be a tailwind. I mean,

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
I think all of those things we have good line of sight to. There are some takes to that. I mean, I think credit,
although still quite good and strong, I mean, the things have – you see credit getting not exactly fully normalizing,
but credit not being quite as perfect as it was a year or two years ago, and the rate environment is also a little bit
of a headwind to [indiscernible] (00:54:05) build in. So all those things together give us a lot of confidence in that
statement.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for the additional color on CECL. That's helpful. I wanted to ask about your
CECL outlook, and maybe this is going into the weeds a little bit for an earnings call. But, John, if I take the
midpoint of your true-up range, 30% to 35%, I get to an ACL ratio, not an ALLL ratio, but an ACL ratio of about
144 bps. And if I forecast that out next year using your provision and your charge-off guidance plus your loan
growth, it implies that that ratio is kind of flat to down-ish a little bit over the course of the year, which suggest your
net new loan growth has loss content that's similar to maybe even slightly lower than what your back book is. So I
guess my question is, am I my thinking about that right, because it does seem counterintuitive a little bit to me that
you're growing, and part of the story is that you're growing in the higher margin segments, especially on the retail
side, which presumably should have a bit higher loss content over the life of the loan than your back book. And I
guess, shouldn't we be thinking that your ACL or your ALLL ratio, however you want to think about it, over time
under CECL if that balance sheet optimization continues, actually migrates upwards? So I guess, I'm just trying to
think about the provisioning guidance relative to charge offs, and sort of net new loan growth and the lost content
of that under CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Well, thanks for that. I'll add a couple of points. First, as we mentioned, we're still working with finalizing our
models. And this is all new to the industry. But we spent a lot of time on it and have some thoughts that we can
share. I will add more thoughts and talk about this further in future calls. But so just to comment on your point, I
think what you have to do is be reminded of two important thoughts; one is, as we mentioned before, we have a
pretty diversified loan growth outlook. So when you think about those loan categories that have lower CECL
content, which is the commercial space and call it mortgage, and if you look at what our expectation is, that
commercial and mortgage are a pretty big part of what we're doing from a dollar perspective because those are
big portfolios and they're growing at good rates. So that drives a lot of dollar loan growth. Whereas the other
portfolios that were growing from the BSO standpoint that we're excited about, which is on the education and
merchant front, are higher percentage growth, but they're not, they're off of smaller basis. So when you look at the
dollars, you're pretty well-balanced from an outlook into 2020 from a CECL standpoint between those loans that
maybe have a higher CECL loss content versus those that have a lower CECL loss content. All that said, charge-
offs aren't affected. And so that's maybe something you can think about when you're looking for that outlook.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Okay. That's helpful. So basically, because it's much bigger dollar value on C&I and mortgage which may have a
lower loss content, it sort of balances out and it really doesn't change your ALLL ratio going forward. Is that sort of
the thought?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
You got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just changing gears a little bit on deposit cost and the outlook there in your NII guidance, so far I
think your deposit costs were down since the second quarter about 21 bps on 75 basis points of cut, so already a
28% beta. What's kind of baked into your guidance for sort of the beta on the downside because you're assuming
the Fed funds rates stays where it's at, how much more in deposit cost reductions, what's the sort of through the
cycle beta that you're assuming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if betas are quite as useful in a period where you think the Fed's going to be on hold. I
mean, when you look at the in period betas, as the Fed doesn't – which is our expectation, the Fed's on hold, but
nevertheless we expect deposit costs to decline in the first quarter, then you're going to have an infinite beta. So
I'm not sure the in periods make sense. But in terms of the cumulative beta, I think we're getting up towards 40%
and may be able to drive that higher in terms of once since the down cycle began and it's in the second quarter if
you use that as the base 2Q of 2019. So yeah, I mean I think that, as I mentioned...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The other point you made earlier, John, is the farther away you get from the Fed pausing then the less opportunity
there is. So we're still going to see some of that in Q1 and then that will start to add as we get through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly. I'd say 1H 2020, we still see opportunities to continue to cause deposit pricing to come down. And then,
the ongoing – throughout the rest of the year, there's still balance sheet optimization activities to even consider,
whether there's some opportunities thereafter, but it does dissipate, as Bruce mentioned. So that's really the
thinking. The other thing I'd just add is that, there's a front book/back book dynamic on CD for our term deposits
that are rolling over, that has been positive and certainly over the last half of 2019. And then, we expect that to be
a positive dynamic as you get throughout most, if not all, of 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. No, that's helpful. And the 40%, just to be clear, that's under 75 basis points. And my question is more just
on the 75 basis points that's been cut already. How to think about the deposit cost relative to that, I guess, the
40% is on that 75 basis points, right?

Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Most of my questions have been asked. But one that comes up sometimes is, merchant partnerships
obviously been very successful and a really good initiative for you. One concern sometimes investors bring up is,
what if a merchant decides to move the relationship. So can you talk to how you make the relationship sticky,
things you do to add value beyond just providing the loan, any contractual provisions you have? Anything like that
for someone who might be worried about one of your partners moving over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad L. Conner A
Vice Chairman-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's a great question that we do get quite a bit. Listen, I hate to be too motherhood and apple pie, but the
way to make them the stickiest is to provide great customer experiences. I mean, at the end of the day, what
we're doing is we're helping our merchant partners sell more product. And we think we've done that in a very big
way with all the partners we've had. We've been – I've even lost track – three years or four years now with Apple,
and we feel like we have just a tremendous relationship with them and that we provide a very unique customer
experience. That has been the entree for us opening up with other partners. We do look at other things that we
can do to deepen the relationships, providing data back to those partners and so forth. But at the end of the day, it
really comes down to just providing a unique and a very exceptional customer experience. I think our partners
would say that we do that well.

John Pancari Q

Just on the expense side, just a couple of quick things there. On the comp expense, you had a good linked
quarter decline in comp expense despite the strength that you saw in the capital markets and FX and other fee
areas. So could you just talk a little bit about what helped drive that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I will just mention that, even though we've talked a lot about TOP 6, really TOP 5 from a more traditional
standpoint has been kicking in as you get into the later part of the year. And we went out with numbers that were
smaller than the $125 million that we're communicating today. So we've been able to upsize those benefits with
respect to TOP 5. And we tend to use those programs to fund investments we would like to make, but also to
maintain profitability and maintain our trajectory that we'd like to see in terms of going forward.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Yeah. I would say a few things on that. I'd say we have a relatively big strategic agenda in 2020. Those are – we
consider them to be critical to maintaining our balance of focusing on the short term and the long term, and that's
our outlook. That said, if something were to be – if there were some stress that would start to be introduced into
the system, there's a significant amount of discretionary investments that we could moderate...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Slowdown in pace, [ph] something like that (01:03:58).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Exactly. And so that's something that we keep an eye on and that's something that we're in detail focused
on, on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis what our investment capacity is and that we would modify that
capacity if things were to deteriorate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Got it. And then my last one is just on CECL. Can you just discuss a little bit if CECL in itself in the day two
impact has influenced your willingness or your appetite to grow in any of the consumer areas where you've been
growing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think it's not the number one issue. I mean, I think we're trying to serve our customers. We're
trying to invest in the markets that where we'd like to play. And we have a very diversified consumer and
commercial lending platform such that, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the way CECL impacts some portfolios
much worse than maybe some others tends to be mitigated through that diversification. So we really focus on
providing that capability. And it's something we'll think about. I mean, it is an additional capital charge to some
portfolios, and we'll just make it part of our balance sheet optimization activities going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say, John, at the end of the day, it's the economics that we're concerned about. And so we don't
want to withdraw capital because of an accounting issue. But having said that, where – we will look at the new
accounting framework, and if there's tweaks that we need to make to a certain product offering, so it could end up
with a better capital treatment, we'll do that. But I'd say, fundamentally, we're going to continue to follow the
economics.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. The first one, in the press release, you had mentioned that you have several
portfolio actions that are expected to boost NIM and ROTCE, that those are under consideration. Are those
already included in your financial targets for 2020, or these are part of your top program, or are these in addition
to what you've already announced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
These, Ken, would be incremental. So I'd say, we're running hard with our balance sheet optimization, and we're
constantly trying to develop new ideas and approaches and say, in an environment where it's hard to make huge
progress in the near-term on ROTCE for the industry, there are certain things we could do to reposition part of the
balance sheet that could create some upward momentum there. So, stay tuned on that. We're not making any
promises, but we wanted to socialize the idea that we're looking at some things, and obviously, we try to do them
in a capital-efficient and capital-neutral way. So that's kind of the trick of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And would these be considered more sort of incremental, like maybe 10 basis points in ROTCE or something
more material?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Too early to tell. Too early to tell. I don't think it would be massive, but if they're worth doing, they should have
some visible impact. But I'm not going to say they'll be massive by any stretch.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Understood. Okay. And then my second question, just in terms of your CE Tier 1 targets, obviously, it looks
like your medium-term targets matched largely your 2020 targets. I mean, is it fair to assume that, once we're into
2020 and certainly into 2021, that capital return becomes a much smaller piece of your overall sort of ROE, or
how you think about, I guess, the capital return could be a lot lower than what it was in years past? I mean,
obviously, I know you're doing a lot to bring down your CE Tier 1 ratio by 40, 50 basis points per year. And it
seems at this point it's going to be a function of your ROE rather than excess capital return. Is that the right way to
think about it?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Yeah. I'd say, look, we're still looking to be friendly to shareholders in terms of our capital return. But increasingly,
we're going to look to the organic growth and where we're allocating our capital to drive earnings performance.
And so I do think more will come from the numerator in getting to that with the exception potentially of the OCI
impact from a steeper curve. But we'll still look to, I think, prioritize organic growth, and having a strong dividend
payout ratio. And if we have capital after that, we'll return it to shareholders. But I still think that can still be a pretty
good payout ratio going forward. It just won't have the same kick and tailwind that it's had as we've been on the
glide path for the last four or five years.

Don, can you share with us, you've had success growing your portfolio in the new markets that you've pointed to
earlier. Can you share with us what kind of industries that you're seeing this growth in the commercial loan book?
And then second, what are some of the strategies you're using to win this new business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So a couple of things just to refresh people's memory. As we went into the new markets, we articulated a strategy
that we wanted to bank larger, more financially flexible company. So it is not a middle market strategy because
I'm very worried about smaller companies and adverse selection. So the credit underpinning is mid-sized
companies. The real driver of the growth is – and I wouldn't say it's any one industry, it's pretty much across the
board. But what we've done in each of the markets is hired people that have been longstanding senior
participants with clients in those markets. And they're bringing clients with them because of their relationships.
And as we interview and as we talk to the teams, we are very focused on who can actually individually move
clients from bank to bank.

And then if you think about disruptions that are going on in the industry per se, there's a lot of clients that are
looking around for other banks to work with them. So I'd say, it's; one, who we hire; two, it's the intensity with
which we're covering these markets; and three, it's a broad-based industry strategy. There's a fair amount of
activity in the southeast which is driving a lot of it because we're longer there in terms of presence on the ground.
Texas is beginning to come in a little bit. It's not an energy strategy. We have an energy team already, we have
for years. And California is very early days. And the other thing we've done is we've upgraded in the Midwest and
brought a new head of the Midwest in because we haven't been satisfied with the progress we've made in those
markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, circling back, Bruce, on capital or capital return, I should say. Obviously, you guys had a
nice increase in the dividend today, it looks like it's about $1.56 annualized now which is about, I guess, between
35% and 40% of 2020 earnings estimates. Is that the long-term kind of dividend payout ratio we should think
about, 35% to 40%, or would you consider similar to some of your peers that are now talking about 40% to 50%
dividend payout ratios over the longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Look, I think it's important to have a good yield on a bank stock, and so have a good dividend payout ratio. So
we've always aspired to do that when we took the company public, and I think we're getting it up to around 40%.
And for now, I think that's a good level to be at. We still have significant organic growth opportunities, and want to
make sure we're balanced in terms of how much we pay out and how much we retained to support growth. So
that's where I'd see it for now.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for letting me squeeze in. I just have a quick follow up on CECL. John, I guess when
you think about the 30% to 35% impact on the Day-1, grows up to the ACL, what's the impact on the commercial
that's embedded in that? So is there a decline in the commercial ACL?

Yeah. I mean, more broadly, we're not really going out line-by-line here. But sure, there's a reasonably large
decline on the commercial side. I think that's true for most portfolios you see out there given the way we handle
incurred loss typically versus where CECL would articulate it. And then that's offset by some of the portfolios that
are maybe more longer duration on the consumer side.

So, would it be similar to what you're seeing on some of your other peers that have broken out commercial versus
consumer impact on Day-1? So is it going to be something similar to them?

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We focus on our numbers. But I mean, I would say, I mean, I think that shouldn't be come as a surprise that
that's really CECL. When you think about lifetime losses, if you have long-duration loans, you're going to end up
with a higher charge for the longer-duration stuff on the consumer side, and then less on the commercial side.
And back to the balance, I mean, I think, overall, we're not seeing a lot of big change in our outlook in 2020 in part
because a lot of this stuff has been diversified across our broad lending base. And so that's really, I think, one of
the messages you could take away.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I think, Brian, if you look at the industry and what analysts expected based on composition of portfolios
and they had us kind of pegged in this range, I don't think there's any big surprises. So the folks who have more
consumer loans, have a higher bump to the reserve, and the ones who have less obviously are lower. So I think
it's playing out probably the way most analysts and investors thought it would.
