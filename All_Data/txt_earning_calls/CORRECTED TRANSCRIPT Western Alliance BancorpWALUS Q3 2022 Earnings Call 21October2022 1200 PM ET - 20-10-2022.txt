Thanks, Miles. This quarter the company continued its strong financial performance, as our diversified national
commercial bank, again, delivered record net interest income, PPNR and earnings, complemented by strong
deposit and loan growth, supporting higher net interest margin with a stable asset quality.
For the third quarter, Western Alliance generated record total net revenues of $664 million, net income of $264
million and EPS of $2.42. Earnings were propelled by accelerating net interest income quarterly growth of $77
million or 15% from the prior quarter to $602 million, as the rising rate environment expanded, our net interest
margin 24 basis points to 3.78%.
We maintained industry-leading performance with return on average assets and return on average tangible
common equity at 1.53% and 24.9%, respectively, which will continue to support building capital levels in the
quarters to come.
Sound balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly loan growth of $3.6 billion or 7.5% quarter-over-quarter
and deposits rose by $1.9 billion or 3.5% quarterly, mostly from noninterest-bearing DDA accounts. Loan demand
remained healthy with 27% of growth coming from our regional banking divisions and 50% from national business
lines.
Deposit growth of $1.9 billion trailed strong loan growth this quarter. In Q3, our regional banking divisions
contributed 32% of deposit growth and our specialized deposit franchises added 63%. We are proud that one of

our new deposit business lines, business escrow services, is gaining meaningful traction and contributed $424
million this quarter. We expect business escrow services, settlement services and other deposit initiatives to
meaningfully contribute to growth and continue to enhance our funding profile in 2023.
Mortgage banking-related income declined $35 million, as the origination market continues to face major market
disruption. The speed and level to which rates have climbed have greatly reduced refinance activity and strained
affordability in the purchase model. Servicing revenue was negatively impacted by a $22 million MSR hedge loss
driven by volatility that spiked towards the back end of the quarter.
We have positioned AmeriHome to profitably operate in a lower origination market focused on becoming the
industry-leading low-cost operator and have implemented a strategy to prioritize profitability against volume
market share.
Finally asset quality continues to remain in great shape and we do not see issues on the horizon. For the quarter,
WAL recorded net loan recoveries of $1.9 million or negative 2 basis points. And year-to-date, we have remained
net recovery position.
At this point Dale will take you through our financial performance.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
For the third quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $264 million, EPS $2.42 and PPNR of $358
million, excluding a $2.8 million mark-to-market loss on preferred securities and $4 million charge related to
severance and other compensation charges, primarily at AmeriHome, our EBS was $2.47 and 13% higher on a
linked-quarter annualized basis.
Additionally, loan growth of $1.3 billion, in excess of consensus, added approximately $10 million in incremental
provisions, which was frontloaded due to CECL. Total provision expense of $28.5 million, also captures our
somewhat softer outlook on the economy.
Total net revenue of $664 million was an increase of $44 million during the quarter and $115 million or 21% year-
over-year. Net interest income increased by 15% from Q2 to $602 million, which is driven by loan growth and
further NIM expansion. Overall, noninterest income declined $33 million to $62 million from the prior quarter due
to the lower mortgage banking-related income, which fell $35 million to $37.5 million.
Gain on sale revenue was $14.5 million due to the lower purchase volumes, while servicing fell to $23 million as
volatility rose, which led to an MSR hedge loss late in the quarter. While the mortgage industry has made strides
in rightsizing overcapacity to adjust to lower volumes in a higher rate environment, this process is ongoing and
normalized margins have not yet returned.
Noninterest expense increased 13.7% or $37 million resulting an efficiency ratio of 45.5%, primarily due to higher
deposit costs related to earnings credit. If efficiency ratio was adjusted to reclassify deposit costs as interest
expense, it would be 40.5% as remaining operating expenses were flat.
Turning now to net interest drivers, our growing asset-sensitive balance sheet benefited from the rising rate
environment. Investment yields increased 72 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.66% as variable rate
securities repriced. On a linked quarter basis, loan yields increased 65 basis points with an end of quarter's spot
rate of 5.43%. Loans held for sale benefited from rising mortgage rates and increased 88 basis points to 4.87%.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Total funding costs, including borrowings and deposits increased 50 basis points to 88 basis points with a spot
rate of 1.12%, as the average rates and balances core deposits rose, short-term borrowings and credit-linked
notes also climbed. Long-term debt expense increased $13.5 million this quarter due to a $940 million in total
CLNs we have issued program to-date, which had preserved nearly $400 million in equity capital and minimized
stock issuance.
The higher interest expense and lower capital issuance also provide us credit protection on 24% of our loan book.
As mentioned earlier, net interest income growth of $77 million or 15% linked-quarter benefited from average
interest-earning asset growth of $3.8 billion and NIM expansion of 24 basis points to 3.78%. Interest income grew
32% more quarter-over-quarter than our total funding costs, inclusive of ECR expenses as we remain asset-
sensitive.
Our rate shock analysis shows with 100 basis point rise over 12 months and on a static balance sheet, net
interest income is expected to lift 6%. Using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet, we expect net interest
income to grow over 15%. Reviewing the effect of a 200-basis-point shock on a growth balance sheet, net interest
income is expected to rise over 25% over the 12 months from the current run rate.
Our efficacy ratio increased 270 basis points to 45.5% after reclassifying deposit costs as interest expense, it
improved from 41.1% in the second quarter to 40.5% in the third, demonstrating the high operating leverage of
the company. Deposit costs increased $38 million from the prior quarter due to higher earnings credit rates on
deposits of $15.9 billion, of which $11.3 billion is in noninterest-bearing DDA.
Pre-provision net revenue rose to a record $358 million during the quarter, a 14% increase from the same period
last year and an increase of $7 million or 2% from the prior quarter. This resulted in PPNR ROA of 2.08%, a
decline of 11 basis points compared to 2.19% last quarter. Whilst leading organic capital generation produces
approximately 45 basis points in CET1 capital on a static balance sheet per quarter and provides significant
financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth or build capital ratios.
Balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased $3.6 billion to
$52.2 billion and deposit growth of $1.9 billion for our balances to $55.6 billion at quarter-end. Mortgage servicing
rates balances increased $218 million during the quarter to $1 billion, in part from declining prepayment fees.
Total borrowings increased $1.1 billion over the prior quarter to $7.2 billion, primarily due to an increase in short-
term borrowings to fund loan growth in excess of deposit expansion. Tangible book value per share increased
$0.49 or 1.3% over the prior quarter to $37.16, primarily due to strong organic earnings that offset unrealized
marks on available for sale securities recorded in AOCI. Tangible book value increased 7.2% over the prior year.
This quarter, we generated sound organic growth from our national business lines and regional banking divisions.
Loans held for investment grew $3.6 billion, driven by $1.6 billion in C&I loans, $893 million in sponsor-backed
commercial real estate and $766 million in residential real estate. C&I growth was driven by $534 million in tech
and innovation, $392 million in warehouse lending, and $350 million in capital call lending. 43% of our loan growth
this quarter came from our core very low to no loss national business lines.
Turning to deposits, we continue to experience growth across our diversified funding channels. This quarter, our
regional banking divisions generated approximately 32% of our net deposit growth, while specialty deposit NBLs
drove the remainder. In total, deposits grew $1.9 billion or 13.9% annualized in the third quarter, with noninterest-
bearing DDA up $1.2 billion, CDs $533 million, and savings and money market $176 million. Noninterest-bearing

DDAs now comprise 45% of our total deposit mix, of which 55% or $13.6 billion have no associated earnings
credit rate.
Our diversified deposit franchises continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to
support loan growth with warehouse lending up $1.2 billion, regional banking divisions up $604 million and
business escrow services up $424 million. Business escrow services has continued to establish new relationships
with large corporate collaborators, attorneys and private investment firms that support the growth ramp this
quarter.
Going forward, we expect our scalable national deposit businesses, such as HLA, settlement services and
business escrow, to continue to generate attractive deposits to fund ongoing balance sheet growth and temper
the impact of elevated rates on our overall funding costs.
Our asset quality remains stable and strong as classified and nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total
assets, are still lower than pre-pandemic levels. Total classified assets increased $39 million in Q3 to $385 million
or 56 basis points of total assets. Subsequent to quarter-end, approximately half of this increase in classified has
been resolved, and we see nothing to demonstrate the trend.
Total nonperforming assets and total assets remained stable at 15 basis points and then realized net recoveries
of $1.9 million. Special mention loans decreased $5 million during the quarter to 60 basis points of funded loans,
which represents a further decline from already historical lows last quarter.
If the prospects for additional economic volatility continue to evolve, we believe our underwriting discipline borne
out through our national business line strategies, has prepared us for any credit stress that may accompany
additional macro headwinds. However, we have not observed any preliminary signs of credit migration or client
pressure.
We believe our safe and sound asset quality decisions will dictate our thoughtful and diversified loan growth
trajectory and enable us to navigate through heightened economic uncertainty. Approximately 55% of our loans
are now in low-to-no-loss categories, and 24% of the portfolio is credit protected through government guarantees,
CLN first loss mortgage cash securities.
Net recoveries were $1.9 million, 2 basis points of average loan which balance to a net recovery position on a
year-to-date basis. Our total loan ACL increased $29 million from the prior quarter to $356 million is now greater
than our pandemic high watermark that was set in 2020. Year-to-date, our ACL has increased by $66 million.
Total loan ACL to funded loans remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 68 basis points, while our ACL to
nonperforming loans rose from 385% in the prior quarter to 396% this quarter. Adjusting for the $10.8 billion of
loans covered by credit-linked notes, where ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party, the ACL
coverage ratio rises to 86 basis points.
We believe these superior asset quality trends are sustainable throughout economic cycles due to Western
Alliance's deliberate post-GFC business transformation strategy to become a national commercial bank focused
on deep underwriting specialization and greater business diversification. WAL's national reach and deep segment
expertise enables selective relationships with the strongest counterparties on their most attractive projects with
superior company risk management.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
During the global financial crisis, 67% of Western Alliance's losses came from loan categories comprising 44% of
the 2009 loan portfolio, which today makes up less than 6% of total loans. Western Alliance has spent the last
decade working to minimize these risks and diversify the businesses. We view a primary impediment to a higher
stock valuation is misplaced concern about the credit risk heading into a likely recession.
Cumulative net charge-offs for the past decade have totaled only $27 million, against $356 million in current
reserves, 55% of our loan book is in low-to-no-loss categories.
Lastly, the intended consequence of the credit-linked notes issuance has 24% of the whole portfolio credit
protected. We knew of no other banks that can make this claim.
Excellent asset quality has been a hallmark of the new WAL. Rapid improvement drove ratios to the top quartile
where they have essentially held even through the height of the pandemic. Classified and non-accrual loans
continue to hold below peers, while charge-offs have been minimal with the net recovery recognized year-to-date.
Non-accruals and net charge-offs have consistently ranked as one – among the best in the industry and classified
loans in the top quartile even during the pandemic.
Our credit risk mitigation expertise shined during 2020 and 2021 and will be critical if the economy weakens
further. A hallmark of WAL's business model is that greater diversification needs to sustain superior earnings
growth with reduced volatility. Similar to a traditional Sharpe ratio for stock returns, our risk-adjusted net income
growth has been excellent relative to other large peers. Among the 33 domestic publicly held, publicly traded
banks in the US, with assets between $25 billion and $150 billion, WAL has produced the highest risk-adjusted
average net income growth. While we weren't the leader in earnings growth or the lowest in earnings volatility
separately, our combined strong and steady growth has produced the top risk-adjusted return.
Given our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic
growth and maintain well-capitalized regulatory ratios. Our tangible common equity to total assets of 5.9% and
common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.7% were both slightly lower than quarter-over-quarter. With AOCI dynamics
impacting tangible book value ratios across the industry, we utilize our ATM to strengthen capital in addition to our
solid earnings.
We do not anticipate any share issuance will be needed if the CET1 builds throughout next year.
Finally, inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.36 per share, our tangible book value per share
increased $0.49 or 1.3% quarter-over-quarter to $37.16, which is slightly above our Q1 level. Notably, our tangible
book value has grown 19.4% annually since 2013, three-and-a-half times the rate of the peer group.
I will now hand the call back to Ken for closing comments.

Thanks, Dale. I was pleased with the management team's ability to adapt to the changing interest rate and
economic environments to produce record operating results. Thoughtful balance sheet growth in conjunction with
operating and executional focus positioned the bank to capitalize on net interest income sensitivity, while
simultaneously growing both sides of the balance sheet with industry-leading performance.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Our superior operating leverage offset the decline in mortgage banking income. Asset quality remained stable and
solid and no signs of elevated stress. Organic earnings should grow capital as we reposition the company for
slower growth ahead of a potential slowdown.
So, let me tell you what you can expect going forward here. Given the uncertain future economic and operating
environment, we believe it's prudent to prioritize more measured, but still double digit loan growth, targeting up to
$1.5 billion per quarter. We plan to surgically reduce loan growth through increased pricing and tighter credit
criteria while de-emphasizing loan growth not accompanied by high quality deposits.
Deposits are expected to grow at approximately $2 billion a quarter. This will lower our loan to deposit ratio over
time, which currently stands at 94%. Our goal over the next year is to bolster key capital ratios back to pre-
AmeriHome levels, including 10% CET1.
Our bank industry leading return on average tangible common equity produced a significant organic capital of
approximately 45 basis points of CET1, net of dividends per quarter, which provides us with significant flexibility to
grow capital ratios and fund the balance sheet growth. We expect to achieve our 10% CET target by mid-2023,
aided by restrained balance sheet growth and risk weighted asset optimization programs.
Net interest margin is expected to continue to expand in Q4 at a similar pace to Q3, given the anticipated rising
rate environment, we expect continued quarterly expansion of NIM and growth in net interest income throughout
2023, even after the Fed pauses rate increases as fixed rate securities and loans reprice and balance sheet
growth continues.
Total revenue should continue to climb due to strong net interest income, with a drag from mortgage banking
likely to moderate, assuming muted volatility. Our expense ratio, excluding the impact of deposit costs, should
remain in the low 40s, given inherent operating leverage of our business. Asset quality remains well-positioned
and ranks among the industry's best. The technical recession we believe we have entered may move some key
ratios slightly higher, but we do not anticipate any material deterioration that would change our above peers
standing.
In conclusion, we continue to see an EPS of $9.80 for 2022 as a launching pad from which 2023 EPS can
ascend.
At this time, we're happy to take your questions. And I should have also said that Tim Bruckner, our Chief Credit
Officer, is with us here today as well.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Your first question is from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Good morning.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I was hoping to get some color on the comments about NIM expanding through next year. Obviously, it sounds
like you're going to be a little bit more selective on the loan growth front, which could help on the yield side. But it
does obviously seem a little bit tougher on the deposit betas and the funding pressure there. So, what kind of –
and I know you guys don't manage to deposit betas, but what kind of deposit beta is in your forecast that is still
allowing you to just drive NIM expansion through next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. So we'll tag team this. Let me start off and then I'll throw it over to Dale. I just want to make sure we're clear
that for Q4 and through 2023, we are projecting a growing and vibrant net interest income, using the consensus
FOMC forecast. So, net interest income and NIM will continue to grow into 2023 even after the FOMC concludes
raising rates. And we feel comfortable with this forecast for several reasons. Number one, the increase or excess
liquidity that we're going to get from having deposits grow faster than loan growth would drive federal home loan
bank borrowings downward, lowering funding costs.
Second, current and future loan growth is being priced at a higher levels, as we've seen liquidity withdrawn from
the banking system. The third item is $1.5 billion of loans repriced every quarter. So it was about 50% rolling over
at higher spreads. And our fixed rate securities and loans totaling $800 million also reprice quarterly, which we
see we think we can get some benefit from.
The other thing I would say is since my return to the company taking over as CEO, we focused on net interest
income rather than net interest margin rate. And then focusing on net interest income allows us to also produce
the EPS results that we have achieved. And so in our mind, what we have done is going forward, we have priced
a 100% deposit beta with a 100% loan beta and we kind of see the spreads which have been materially
increasing for us certainly since the beginning of Q3, but even before that to carry us for the rest of the year.
Dale, do you want to add anything to that?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Casey, we have lower levels of interest-bearing deposits and other funding sources, borrowings and CLNs
and we do in terms of interest asset earning loans and securities. And that's primarily because of our DDA that
has no ECR, I mentioned that is $13.6 billion. And so we're okay bringing on high beta funding, as long as it's
going into a 100% beta assets and we're going to continue to see that. I think some of the other institutions have
been challenged because they've actually held back on their deposit – raising those costs of their consumers or
something else and they believe that it's going to withstand that. And then they've been surprised. And so now
they have betas in excess of 100%, at least for some accounts.
We haven't been there. We know what our funding looks like. We haven't realized that we can kind of sneak
things by and so we have been – our pricing is right there in terms of where it needs to be and what we're seeing
in terms of our spot rates kind of confirms this. So, for example, on our loan yields, our spot rate at the end of the
second quarter was 4.51% at the end of the third quarter, it was 5.43% up 92 basis points.
Meanwhile, for our funding costs, our deposits, liabilities and cost was up from 63 to 112, so up 51 basis points
and again, what we had during the second and third quarter is we had loan yields tempered because that we
were forced. We're still active. That's not the case anymore. And so we see that picking up and then we're going
to have more dollars rolling over in terms of maturities. And right now, those fixed rate loans are about 300 basis
points below the current operate that we would do today. That is going to reprice more than what we're going to
see on liabilities, because liability repricing for us hasn't lacked.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, Casey I'm going to give you a quick story. I think that everyone on the phone will like. And then I'm going to
ask you for a pop quiz here. Okay. We turned down 31 loans in our senior loan committee, those were loans $25
million or greater, not because of credit. We like the credit a great deal, but we turned them down because of
pricing and their initial price wasn't a high enough or the step downs were coming down too quickly or we didn't
like the floors and we decided to move the floors up. And so here's your pop quiz. How did we do against 31
loans? We went back to the borrowers and asked them if they would accept the higher pricing level.

31 people came back and said yes to the higher price. You're right. And that told us a few things. One, it makes
us almost feel like you put your house on the market on day one and you sell it. First thing you say is, oh, my
God, I sold it too cheaply. So what we really determined from that and that was over a couple of weeks' period
when we went back and looked at the 31 loans, but what we've really determined was liquidity is leaving the
system, right? And one of the things that's natural for us and what's different for our bank versus others is that we
try to be a bank for all seasons and we try to remain open for all seasons.
Now, that may mean that we tightened credit criteria which we have. It may mean that we ask for more equity in
the deals which we have, and it may mean that we're asking for higher pricing. But we remain open. And one of
reasons you see the volume – the loan volume continue to come in above what our previous guide has been is
because we've developed this loyalty and people come to us because they know they can get a deal done. And
the incremental short-term costs or higher cost of funding doesn't compare to the longer term value that they're
getting. So, I just wanted to – you asked a simple question and we decided to give you a long answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, no, appreciate it. Okay. Just on the 10% CET1 target by midyear. So is there anything that you're going to
do that organically, right just moderating the loan growth or is there -...

Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...and without the ATM, is there any – like bond book run off, is that part of it or anything else that help you get
there on that in short order?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, there are two things that we're doing. Certainly just repositioning our loan growth to up to $1.5 billion is
going to help us probably grow net 12 to 14 basis points per quarter. We generally do 45 basis points of organic
growth, subtract out for the $1.5 billion and that's how you get to 12 or so basis points quarter-by-quarter. The
other thing is Tim Bruckner is sitting here with us, but he has led this re-optimization or optimization of our risk
weighted assets, specifically around unfunded commitments, and we expect that to grow as well.
There may be a CLN note that you'll see a deal happen in maybe this quarter or maybe in quarters one or two.
And it's the combination of those things and a bunch of other smaller activities that I just don't think are worthwhile
going through at this time that drive us to a 10% level Q2, we think latest Q3. And it's all without – you asked a
very specific question, it's all without hitting the ATM.

Please go ahead.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, it's Ibrahim here. I guess, just maybe going back to comments around $2 billion plus in deposit growth, put
some perspective around your comfort around there. Obviously, there is a lot of concern around the industry
around deposit pricing, deposit growth, so like your conviction level in meeting those deposit growth numbers and
then how should we think about its impact on deposit costs and mix shift as we think through 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We're going to split this one up and tag team it as well. I'll take the volume side, Dale will take the cost side. And
so if I heard you clearly enough and correct me if I'm wrong, that you really want to know what gives us the
confidence around the $2 billion, right. Well, we've been running that and then some on that if you go back looking
at our history. While we have got several deposit franchises that are very strong, we have our HLA business,
okay, that's strong, settlement services is something we started to build in 2018. We rolled out in 2019. It now has
$3 billion of deposits.
And so going back a couple of years, when everyone – when I say everyone, other banks said, gee, we don't
want any more deposits. We always said no deposit franchises will really determine what our market capitalization
will be in the future and how well we perform. So, we rolled out settlement services, we rolled out business
escrow services. We also have a tech business that produces $3 of deposits for every $1 in loans. Warehouse
lending has also been a very strong provider of deposit growth.
And I want to bring you back to AmeriHome for a moment. This is very important. When we bought AmeriHome,
we said we bought it because we saw an emerging regional bank. In the seven quarters that we've owned
AmeriHome, we've taken AmeriHome's deposits from a standing start of 0 to $7 billion, $7 billion in seven
quarters, right.
I wouldn't tell you not to extrapolate that going forward, but it goes to show you that $7 billion really sat – it really
sits on the bank side of the company and has been generating that incremental interest income from us. So,
those are the growth channels.
Do you want to take the cost side Dale?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, on the cost side of that, I'll note we talked about that we've brought in $420 million of deposits from
business escrow services. Well, $300 million of that is in non-ECR DDA. So, that should help us on the cost side
and we're getting traction there. I got to tell you, we've got an application pending with the OCC to commence a
corporate trust operation. We think that that is likely to kick off this particular time. We hired a team from Wells
Fargo after they sold their operation. And we think that's going to be a source of funding for us also kind of going
forward.
And then in terms of your deposits, so again, we're there that we're not trying to necessarily wrestle that
everything has to come in and super cheap standard rates or not market rates. But we have the ability and we've
12

(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
demonstrated this to bring in funds consistently. I would say our pipelines going forward are at least as good as
what they've been the past couple of quarters. And it has been a little harder than we thought. We did exceed
loan growth versus deposit growth, we're right sizing that from Q4 forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Let me just tie it back to a question that Casey asked us as well and tie it back to net interest income. If you don't
have loan growth, it's harder to bring in deposit growth because that deposit growth is coming in at a very high
incremental cost to it. We have the ability to grow loans in excess of $1.5 billion and you've seen that, right? And
so the fact that we can match off deposit growth at a marginal rate compared – with a 100% beta to it compared
to 100% beta on the loan side allows us to make the spread and, as we've said, we've increased those spreads.
So that's what kind of gives us the benefits.
And again, I'll point you right back to – and I don't think we get enough credit for this and I'm going to start harping
on it that our business model is different than almost every other bank's business model. And this is what our
model allows us to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. As far as there's no pop [indiscernible] (00:35:28) I'm fine with that. And I guess, just another follow-up
question, Dale, you talked about credit costs. When you look at the ACL 86 basis points, what should that – what
is that embedding in terms of the macro, understanding your portfolio is very different? If the economy is headed
into a recession, where do you see that reserve ratio building? Because that's the other piece of downside EPS
risk as we think about the next few quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we use the Moody's model like I think most do. We take weights. The preponderance is on the kind of
consensus, and then we have a much heavier weight on S4 versus S1. And so, as those numbers have become
kind of more impaired, as they did in third quarter over second, it did pull up a little bit more in terms of what an
appropriate ACL would be.
I would say we're not expecting charge-offs to occur. And as long as we are right side up on LTVs and we're a low
LTV lender across the board, our residential book was underwritten at 65% and it is now probably under 60% in
terms of LTV. Our commercial real estate is on anywhere from 45% to about 65%. And so we feel strongly that –
and the Moody's model show this that unless there's something really severe happening, we're going to be able to
do well on that.
I'd like to point back to the pandemic, we saw the hotel book and hotels clearly took a direct hit from travel during
2020 and 2021. And people were throwing numbers back at me in terms of what we're looking at, in terms of
losses. We didn't lose a dime in hotels the entire time. It's because we've had good sponsorship, low loan to value
and we're – and the type of loans we're doing we weren't doing central business, big boxes, where people weren't
coming anymore and that have very little cost structures in terms of not a lot of flexibility, these are like select
service deals, like a residents in and the hotel they close, every other floor to hold their costs down and that
worked and it worked for us.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just making sure I heard you correctly. I think you mentioned full year EPS $9.80 implies about $2.77
to $2.78 exit EPS run rate for fourth quarter. Do you believe you can grow earnings off of that in 2023?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. If I heard you correctly, Ibrahim, I mean, yes, we think that the $9.80 is period from – that we can – that's
the support quarter number and implicitly obviously, and that from there, given what we expect to happen in terms
of a continued loan growth a little bit more tempered than maybe what the Street has had us at, but margin
expansion, which is the opposite of what the Street has had us at, now we can continue to sustain that throughout
2023. Again, this is the backdrop of what the FOMC actions are going to be as predicted in the futures curve.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Much better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. On the deposit cost side, if I include the cost of the earnings credit-related deposits and the cost of total, we
calculate these change by about 61 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Earning assets are up 71 basis points. So
from a spread view, it's up about 10 basis points. Looking at it through that lens, how do you see that spread
trending over the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Probably most likely parallel. I mean, I think we have a little bit [indiscernible] (00:39:43) in the loan side because
of kind of they were held back, but because of floors but yes, we're comfortable with the parallel shift there and
also, we're getting better pricing on the loan side. And I don't think that we – there is much more to go on funding
cost increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. On the ECR deposits, how much of the $2 billion per quarter growth do you assume will come from that,
and how should we think about that cost moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We're not expecting that our deposit structure on the liability side is going to be improving at all. And so what
we've dialed in is growth predominantly in either interest-bearing or in ECR-related. I do think that we've got
opportunities to bring some other stuff in as I mentioned with business escrow services and some of these others.
But that is not a major factor in terms of moving that needle. I think we're going to be paying for deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then finally in terms of pulling back the lending a bit, which categories are you planning to de-
emphasize here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, good question, Steve. And so as I've said, we've tried to do this in a very surgical way. So we're going to
pull back our resi loan growth, this quarter it was $750 million. I would expect that to drop to under $250 million in
Q4 and then drop to under $100 million going forward. But just to refresh the memory for those on the phone, it
wasn't too long ago that we had $6 billion sitting in liquidity at 10 basis points. And so building up a residential
book seemed to be the appropriate thing to do back then, we're not going to be emphasizing it now going forward.
The other places you'll see us be more circumspect on is in the capital call subscription line space. We really
haven't seen the cross-lending portfolio company opportunities that we hope to have materialized, but they did
15

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
not. And so we're going to pull back there. That business eats up a lot of our unfunded lines, our unfunded
commitments. That's why Tim Bruckner is working on that in terms of the optimization.
And I guess I would say the other thing is, we continue to stay close to all our clients and no loan gets approved
certainly at the most senior level in this company without a significant deposit relationship coming over. And we've
made that a big focus as well. And therefore, if you're not bringing over deposits, then some of our loan growth
will slow naturally.
But quite frankly, as a entrepreneurial bank that has always outperformed on the loan growth side, this is a
challenge for us, to a certain extent to be more surgical on where we're going to grow and now we think can do
that and we think we could keep the loan growth to under $1.5 billion. And that kind of connects back to the CET1
ratio and why we're trying to also move it up to 10%. We're not getting credit for the loan growth, Steve, and
people are saying, well, you're probably lending into a recession. We just will pull back and we'll look for higher
yields on all that.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Ken, I think I heard you mention that you thought the efficiency ratio would stay in the low 40s sort of the impact of
ECR deposit costs. I want to make sure I heard that correctly. So there were some severance, small severance
costs in the quarter and wondering if what the benefit from those might be going forward.
And then finally, because you're pulling back on growth, does that mean we should maybe think about, pulling
back on the expense growth as well? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of the expenses ex-ECR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So you did hear me correctly that ex-deposit costs the efficiency ratio should stay in the low 40s. Brad if we
don't keep it there, I mean, look, we could take it down, but we're not going to do that for several reasons. And I
think I've been clear about this on previous calls. Number one, we're preparing for the day that we grow over the
$100 million threshold and we always need to continue to invest at risk management and technology which we're
doing.

We also are continuing to invest in new products and new services, new rollouts. And Dale mentioned one we
actually got a little ahead of what I was going to say about that on the corporate trust, I was going to wait until we
brought in some deposits. But we've built that into our expense base next year as well, which is a new product or
a new business line. So it's important for us to continue to build up these new business lines and that's why we're
going to keep it in the low 40s, that will help us or that will not deter our growth in total EPS as we roll into 2023.
There were a couple of components to your question, did I answer all of them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, I think so. And maybe as my follow-up question to Dale, just on the ECR deposits again, do you see a
change in the pace of that beta or that rate in which those costs are going up, do you see that accelerating, I am
sure, it's not decelerating, but just kind of curious your thought around just kind of the pace of that change going
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I don't, I mean I think out of the gate we had some that were a little more sluggish than others. But this has been
the most widely telegraphed rate rise scenario I think in history. And no one is not aware of it, not Western
Alliance anyway and so, yeah, so we're – they are fully participating. They're basically moving in lockstep with
FOMC or effective Fed funds.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Let me give you the broader direction and tell you what we are planning for in 2023. So, we are using the
Q3 total mortgage servicing revenues of $37 million as our base going forward throughout 2023. We hope to do
much better than that, but for our planning purposes $37 million is the base as we go forward. So that's I think the
first thing.
Regarding the $22 million [indiscernible] (00:47:24) that we had, our models when we model things, we model out
the life of loan for 30 years, all the cash flows and then we discount it back and we hedge that in our model. But
we hedge it out to 18 months after that there's not enough liquidity in some of the hedging instruments. And so we
took a little bit of a hit in the volatility going out above 18 months.
Now what I should say and we should have said in the opening statements here, we pulled back half of that in the
MSR valuations. We have outside firms look at the MSR valuations and so while we took the $22 million
[indiscernible] (00:48:03) back about $10 million of that. So the net impact was $12 million. But we're also doing
something different in the business. We continue to right size that business, we're probably down about 29% in
total people count there. So we're trying to make sure we are the low cost operator in that space and we're not
trying to win share for share purposes only. We're trying to win profitable share. So the volume, [indiscernible]
(00:48:31) we purchased will be less, but we are pushing and hopefully the market will see this and also follow
that the margins will increase and so far early results in the early Q4 is that, strategy is beginning to work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great color. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just going back to one of Dale's
comments on talking on asset quality, you mentioned that the provision is going to capture a softer view of the
economy. I know you're pulling back on some lending verticals, but that doesn't seem credit-related. I guess as
you look out across your landscape what are those softer areas that you're kind of focusing on here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
You mean softer [indiscernible] (00:49:26) more opportunistic areas. Actually, I'll let Tim answer this.
<<A – [0CQY4B-E]Tim Bruckner – Western Alliance Bancorp.>: [indiscernible] (00:49:30) we signaled that we
saw some headwinds in the economy, where have we pulled back or where have we responded? Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Right. So, okay, great. So a year ago, we started adding a real heavy stress to everything; development,
construction-related and commercial real estate. Okay, so that's one. So we had tempered our underwriting.
We've maintained that. We've become more conservative in advance and underwritten with a significantly heavier
interest rate stress. I think that's positioned us well in that segment.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
On the investor dependent side, starting in November – October and November of last year, we significantly
stressed our enterprise valuation methodology. So those two areas are areas that, given our portfolio weighting,
would receive more stress and we adjusted early.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We're also breaking our portfolio down, we did this coming out of last year into four major categories, the
insurable portfolio, which Dale referenced, which is about 24% of our portfolio is a credit protected insured or
have a government guarantee to it. We have economic-resilient, economic-resistant and then we have economic-
sensitive. And we've been de-emphasizing the economic-sensitive loan categories and staying with the other
three actually basically the insurable category and the economic-resistant categories and we're going to be
spending more of our time in terms of our lending pursuits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have certainly outpaced the market when it comes to warehouse
lending. And I know a good component of that is just kind of tapping into the AmeriHome network. I guess how big
of an opportunity is left there and maybe just broader thoughts around warehouse would be appreciated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So when we say warehouse lending, we've got a couple of components to that, one is the traditional
warehouse lending, but also [indiscernible] (00:51:59) warehouse funding is our note financing opportunity, that's
note-on-note financing where we'll see LTVs of about maybe 40% or lower and we'll be in a first position.
The note financing business is really very strong at this point. And so it is helping lift the warehouse lending side a
little bit. But to be honest with you, we're still seeing a lot of good growth coming in warehouse lending and there I
would say that we're taking some market share as well as people are pulling back and as other people are
struggling to deliver the type of service we deliver. We're also seeing MSR lending is embedded in that group too,
and that has a lot of interest from borrowers and we have some comfort level that we can grow that throughout
2023.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
So if I look at our spot rates, we have a greater momentum coming from Q2 and Q3 that isn't captured in the
average rates on the loan side more significantly than it is on the funding side. And I think that's because in part,
the loans were held back because of floors that and nothing is close to a floor today. And so I think that carries us
in terms of what that looks like going forward.
And so, as long as we have a loan beta from here that is no lower than the deposit beta, and we're anticipating
deposit betas to be very high, we're going to continue to do well. And especially if we can reprice things higher, as
Ken mentioned, with these 31 returns that we had from our senior loan committee, all of which came back with,
yeah, we'll take the underwriting even at a higher cost. So we think we're well-situated to secure that.
Now, through the fourth quarter, I mean, I think we're dialing in 75 basis points and then 50 basis points and then
we don't have anything in 2023. I think maybe there's going to be a little bit of a tail. But with that kind of a profile
and with really the repricing we're doing on our loan book that isn't – I don't see that in our funding book because
our funding book is already really fully moving in lockstep. Now, we do have some benefit opportunities like we
had in 3Q, where $300 million of our DDA was not ECR-related, I think some of those things are going to kick in,
but we don't have to do that, so as long as we – all we have to do is to have our loan betas be no lower than our
deposit betas, the loan book and with the securities book, which is demonstrating variable rate as well largely,
we're going to be able to continue to have expansion of net interest margin and then couple that with a more
modest expansion of the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I did – no, no. I mean, look, it's really – as Ken mentioned, that's not our management thing, we are not

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Just one question for me, I mean I understand and I see these benefits when rates are rising. But I'm
curious, what are the actions you've taken in the event that we have a recession and theoretically rates will fall,
just curious if there have been any actions that you've taken in place to kind of protect against that for the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So one thing really helped us during the pandemic is we are active and basically mandate and do you think
that this is a syndicated situation led by somebody else and we get [indiscernible] (00:57:49).
And so we did that and that held up our loan yields much better than some others. And it kind of improved our net
interest income. We're still doing that today. They're really, I would say, largely ineffective at this point in time
because you put a floor in maybe that floor is a 100 basis points lower than the current rate, based upon the
variable rate instrument there. And then if it goes up another 150 basis points in the next 90 days, it's just going to
be way out of the money.
But if we hold at higher rates for, say, like a year, we'll be able to reprice a lot of those floors much closer to the
current rate which will give us a lot of insulation in terms of what that would be like. The other thing I would say is,
when gosh, I mean, in a lower rate environment I think the mortgage market is going to get jumpstarted and we're
certainly ready for that also.

Okay. And no other, I guess hedges or interest rate collars being put on the balance sheet, has that been
contemplated as well?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We always debate that and we put some term kind of hedges on and we – some fixed swaps back when rates
were in low couple of digit basis points. So we'll evaluate that at that time, but again that's just to mitigate kind of
the downturn.

Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Hey, thanks. How are you guys doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good, good. Just a few clean-up questions. One, on Chris McGratty's question on the run rate deal, I know it's
kind of nit-picky. But if you take the annualized $9.80, you get to $2.45 for the fourth quarter. I think you're saying
that's too low, but we kind of have to stretch to get to $9.80. Just clarifying that for us on the $9.80 number, what
do you mean by that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, the $9.80 is the full year operating EPS. So you have to be above – maybe I misunderstood Chris' question a
little bit, you have to be above that. That's going to take you to kind of the $2.70 range or somewhere in there to
be able to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, for the fourth quarter. And you're saying that's the jumping in off point for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Yeah. Okay. I've had a couple of questions. I think people know I'm the last guy on the call maybe. But can you
talk about the ECR expenses and talk about the efficiency ratio with ECR and how you want us to think about that
expense in the model?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so we're showing it both ways. I mean to me if it looks, act and smells like something maybe that's what you
should call it. I think it really acts like interest expense. That's not really how the gap maps it geographically. So,
here we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So we look at both ways. I do think that taking it out and considering it as interest expense gives one a much
better view in terms of one is the bank asset-sensitive or not, how [indiscernible] (01:01:11) rising and interest
income relative to expense and we're still higher not as much higher as if we keep it in expense.
And then and then you look at your operating kind of architecture and we're in the low-40s. If you just eliminate it
completely and I think those are kind of both appropriate. As Ken said I think our efficiency ratio going forward
roughly the same position of the low 40s is appropriate and again, we're looking for continued improvement on net
interest income growth relative to interest expense, including deposit costs.
[indiscernible] (01:01:48)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
...Jon I'll add only one thing to that is, you'll see deposit cost rise in Q4 again near maybe the same level as Q3.
But as we begin to enter into 2023 that rise will be tempered and it won't be as noticeable as we go through 2023
based on the FOMC projected rate increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. I just have two more for Ken, just kind of on that topic, when do you think the margin starts to
top out kind of when or where because I look back in my models and I know your business is a little different, but
you are approaching the high 4s in the last hiking cycle and I'm just curious if that's just out of the question and
just the timing on when you think this all might peak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So again, everything is predicated, at least right now for us on what the FOMC is going to do, which for us is 75
bps in a couple of weeks followed by 50 bps. That's in our – that help in our forecast. We actually don't have
anything in there at all, any upward actions in 2023. But we see in terms of the NIM, the rate, we see that
continuing to rise quarter-to-quarter, it may flatten a little bit out towards the very end of the year, but right now we

even still have that kind of rising as a nice slope throughout the year in excess of what we see in consensus, but
certainly lower than the historical highs that you alluded to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Got you. All right. And then the last one I have, I like what you guys are doing, but I have to ask this.
When you go 31 for 31 on the higher pricing, I mean, I understand that's a positive, but you could take it the other
way as well. It could cause you the question pricing and the competitive environment as well. But what is that –
what do you really learn from that the 31 for 31? What does that say about the competitive environment? And
maybe what did you learn from that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, thanks, Jon. On the competitive side, it's telling us that other banks, other competitors have pulled back
probably for several reasons. First and foremost, we think it's because they don't have that deposit base that we
have or that fresh liquidity coming into their bank, number one. Number two, they may be more regionalized in
their lending or they may be just more product niche focused. We have the ability to deploy liquidity and capital to
at least 17 different national business lines that we have inside the bank.
So it gives us an opportunity to really flex our business models and capability. The third may be different
perception on the economy. Now, we are expecting a recession and we are modeling that and we are doing our
underwriting as if a recession is going to occur. And of course, we stress test everything for a much higher rates
and lower vacancies and lower rents and all the other things you would expect us to do. But we feel comfortable
with our underwriting and the quality of borrower that we're getting in and the reason why I think we feel
comfortable, one of the reasons is back to being a bank for all seasons.
We remain open. And as I said, this to every clients, we'll always remain open to try to help you, but given the
economic, either uncertainty or environment, we're going to just change around credit criteria, equity that we're
going to require in a deal and pricing. But you should be able to get a loan from us, assuming that the deal pencils
out and then we're dealing with a good borrower.
And [indiscernible] (01:05:59) a little bit about higher interest rates, they come back and pay them because they
realize the short-term cost of that interest rate is nothing compared to the longer term benefits they're going to get.
And so this comes back to the service side, dependability, the ability to close, when we say we're going to close,
we close. And once we shake hands, we don't retreat. And that has a lot of positive force to having our clients
continue to return to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And we don't provide a commodity service. I mean, so even, in normal times, our pricing is almost always higher
than others, but because of what Ken said in terms of our ability to kind of to deliver on time and in this consistent
structure as promised, that's where something to our clients and they are willing to pay for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
