Begoña Morenés
Global Head-Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results
for the Fourth Quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following
today are available to you on our website.
I am joined here today by our Executive Chair, Ms. Ana Botín, our CEO, Mr. Héctor Grisi; ad our CFO, Mr. José
García Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have
in the Q&A session.
With this, I will hand over to Ms. Botín. Ana, the floor is yours.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, thank you, Begoña, and good morning to everybody. It's a great pleasure to be with all of you. Sorry. Good
morning, everybody, and thank you, Begoña. Great pleasure to be with you all and thank you for joining.
As a reminder, we have recently announced a last step towards One Santander. We finished the creation of the
five global businesses, which we began a few years ago. I will come back to this in more detail in a moment, but I
would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that
were communicated last December. So, the focus today will be first, main highlights of our results, an update on
our strategy. Héctor will then review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I'll conclude with a few
closing remarks on our guidance for 2024.
So, the high level messages we're presenting record results, €11.1 billion. We have delivered again on all our
financial targets. Our customer focus and scale are driving consistent, sustainable, profitable growth. In 2023, we
added 5 million customers and our revenue increased double digit. And we did this as we continue, and
something we've reiterated year-after-year, we are investing for the future and we are also making excellent
progress towards a more simple and more integrated model. This is the driver to the improvement in efficiency
year-after-year, 173 basis points. And it's also the driver to increase our profitability this year to above 15% as we
committed. We have also in 2023 strengthened our balance sheet, growing deposits, sound asset quality again
with our guidance and increasing our gross organic capital generation.
So, in summary, backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks, our earnings per share
grew 21%, our TNAV and cash DPS by 15%, and once approved by shareholders, we expect our dividend per
share to be near 50% higher than last year.
So, just briefly to the income statement. Again, you can see the successful execution of our strategy and a strong
top line performance. And what's really important is that across all our global businesses, this is the case. Our net
interest income rose 12%, 16% in constant euros in a context of higher rates and with a special good
performance in our Retail & Commercial Banking business in Europe and Mexico. Net fee income was also
higher. In this case, the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions or global businesses are the
Corporate Bank and Payments driving higher fees.

Very important, the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle. [ph] I want (00:03:52) –
special focus on the high quality of our revenue, where net interest income and fees are more than 95% of total
income and drove the vast majority of Santander's total revenue growth.
We're growing cost less than revenue. So, positive operating leverage, including investment in our transformation
where we're already seeing results. We achieved record net operating income of €32 billion. That's the second
highest among our global peers, again, showing our continued focus on operational performance. And finally, the
strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk, where we finish at 118 bps, again better than our
guidance [indiscernible] (00:04:32) and therefore delivering on all the targets as I just mentioned.
So, what this means in terms of capital generation and the double-digit shareholder value creation that resulted
from the results? We're ending the year at the same level as September with a CET1 ratio at 12.3%, and that is
after accruing 50, sorry, after accruing 20 basis points for the buyback, which means it actually would have been
at 50 basis points on a like-for-like compared to last year.
We delivered 15% growth in shareholder value creation. Again, this represents an increase of more than €10
billion in the year and already mentioned 50% increase in cash DPS against 2023 results once we get
shareholders' approval in March. The reduction in the number of shares through our share buybacks also of
course helped and higher payout, which we increased from 40% to 50% this year. We continue to believe that at
these prices, share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate shareholder value. Since
2021, we have repurchased 9% of outstanding shares and buybacks currently deliver a return on investment of
close to 18% for our shareholders.
So, let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets. Step
by step, we are making our business model stronger. We continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year-
after-year, low volatility, high predictability, while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration. The record
results in 2023 means a 10% CAGR in profit since 2013, increasing profitability to 15.1% from below 10%. Again,
improvements each and every year with the exception of COVID and, at the same time, we have steadily grown
our capital. Please remember that when I took over, we had a CET1 ratio of 8.3%. So, we have a lot more capital
and delivering much better results.
I also want to point you to a couple of numbers, which is over the past nine years, we've generated approximately
€26 billion of capital which we've used to build up CET1 to 12.3%. And that is on top of the €27 billion paid to
shareholders over this time period. Very importantly today, shareholder remuneration is five times that of 2014
and has grown again every year except for the COVID crisis, where dividends were halted in light of the ECB's
recommendations. As we think about value creation, this is our framework. We presented this one year ago in our
new medium-term plan. This is a new face of value creation where we are having a very strong first year, as
you've seen in today's results.
We are on track to achieve all the targets and, very importantly compounding our equity through increased profits,
which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road.
I would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with
retail and consumer DCB, which of course is the majority of Santander. And this is the reason we are confident
we will continue to deliver medium-term targets and beyond the customer focused diversification. Huge strength
at times like this and because we are doubling down on a very unique Santander strength, which very few can
replicate, which is our local leadership on our global scale and network.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
We are the only bank in the world that has such a global and end market scale at the same time. A 165 million
customers globally with a market share over 10% in most of our core markets, and operating at scale in every one
of them. The strength and potential of Santander's scale and network, again are already evident in the numbers
for this year. We can serve more customers, capture new revenue streams that some of our competitors cannot.
And it is precisely this network effect which is helping us to grow cross-border flows. And you see this already in
the very substantial growth in global businesses like the corporate bank, and we are increasingly seeing that also
in Payments and others. But very important, this scale allows us to invest together once across the group to
operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience. So, it's a win-win combination both on
revenues and efficiency.
And you're going to see much more of this in the years ahead because this combines at very strong starting point
with a strong franchise and in parallel the deployment of our global platforms, which include proprietary
technology. Again, this is incredibly differential for Santander vis-à-vis most of our peers, and we are ultimately
aiming to be the most profitable Retail & Commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate.
We're already top three in terms of profitability in eight of our 10 markets, but we have a lot more upside.
I'm not going to go over the slide, but it's really a summary just to remind us where we are. It's the last step. We
took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions, but now, in the Retail Bank and in the consumer
bank/DCB, we have taken a very important strategic step. We're operating in this way already during 2023. We're
pulling investments. We're reducing cost in a structural way, and I want to emphasize in a structural way. We are
already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently, and again, improving customer
experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth.
So, just briefly, the five divisions. The Retail Commercial Bank (sic) [Retail & Commercial Bank] (00:10:50), which
I will refer to as Retail. Our vision, we said it a year ago, is becoming a digital bank with branches. This means
three very important steps. First, simplifying our product offering and making it digitally available, with a branch
network of people serving as very powerful sales and value-added advisory channel.
In 2023, we'll reduce products by 16% globally and 56% of our products are already fully available through digital
channels. But very importantly, in the second half of the year, we did most of this. So, there is an acceleration in
this transformation, which Héctor is driving.
Second step, really important, a common operating model across our banks, which allows automation at a much
higher level, freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on value-added services. Again, dedication of
resources, and this is a metric we'll continue to track, non-commercial activities dropped 1.5% in the second half
of 2023. Again, a trend that is accelerating. You'll see more good news of this in the next few years.
And the third incredibly strategic step is that our global tech platform. This is being rolled out in Retail
Commercial. This is not a PowerPoint. This is happening. We are leveraging Gravity, which is our award winning
backend, where we partnered with Google and ODS, which is our cloud-based frontend, which is built by us
operating an Openbank and tested and working – Openbank as a reminder, is the largest native digital bank in
Europe in 2023 by size of deposits. All our Retail and consumers are not just retail, but our consumer bank DCB,
all will be converge into this common retail global front-tech starting in 2024 with the US. This is going to allow us
to both drive customer growth, but also better efficiency and therefore profitability in a sustainable way.
So, our consumer bank, this is Digital Consumer Bank, the goal here is to become the partner of choice for our
customers and again deliver superior profitability. Three main points here is in auto and consumer lending, we're
5

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
offering best-in-class solutions for our both commercial customers and consumers. We're benchmarking very
much the same as in retail against the best players, whether the banks or digital players, we want to be number
one, fastest credit approval, fastest onboarding, more convenient, et cetera.
The second point is, we are – and we've done this already for a couple of years, managing our OEM relationships
and our retail relationships globally. This is again a very important advantage. This means, for example, we can
integrate the large digital e-commerce players just once. And of course, that is something which is not available to
many, and expanding our partnerships in Europe to LATAM and the US.
And third and really important, we're planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by
deploying these common platforms, and there are several. There's open bank, of course, leasing, there's buy now
pay later, which we have built our own buy now pay later, it's already up and running in Europe, and this common
frontend with OEMs and dealers. Again, we deployed a new pan-regional leasing platform in 2023, and very
important, in the US our own open bank ODS, Gravity platform is already technically up and running. We expect
to launch in the US in the second half of 2024 a fully digital offering nationwide. And then, in 2025 to have all our
US customers including our current retail customers on that same platform. Again, this is a big driver already
behind our numbers, improving our efficiency overall, but in specific in the US and would be an even bigger driver
down the road.
In our corporate bank, we're building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five, six years.
We're leveraging our strengths, our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have
more profitable customer relationship across our markets, whilst maintaining the same risk profile. And we will
continue to pursue the same strategy, focusing on customers. More than 80% of our revenues are coming from
customer revenues. And with a very close coordination between the global, local teams, this is working really well.
We're now having strategic dialogues with customers that were mostly lending customers, and that is something
which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the US. But there's also a very important
opportunity to leverage the BRL 9 million existing group corporate and SME customers with these products. And,
of course, this will grow collaboration revenues. This will deepen our relationships, will drive profitable growth,
growing fees, and support our capital-light model.
I want to also point out some of the numbers on the slide where our Corporate Investment Banking business is
already growing faster than the balance sheet. And you can see here how total revenues to RWAs is improving to
6.7%. And last but not least, this is a very predictable, sustainable and low-volatility business, delivering
consistent profitable growth for the last five, six years, a very different path from other players.
So, again, the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger. We've done that in London and
we're now doing that in the US, to make sure we can leverage our network, accelerate process automation. We
will increase asset rotation. And this, all in all, will drive efficiency and profitability improvements.
In our Wealth business, we are aiming, again, to leverage our strengths. Our global model is aiming to capture
growth by leveraging, in the case of private banking, our strong presence in Miami, one of the top Latin American
private bankers. So we'll expand on that basis in the US, in our asset manager, again, leveraging to the strengths
we have in verticals such as renewables, infrastructure, SMEs. Again, this is something we've already been doing
the last few years. And in insurance, focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like
health savings, also SMEs.
In general, again the same principles as for other global division, simplification. In the case, for example, of our
investment products and building together. I want to end by saying the same as for corporate bank that private
6

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together, and this is, again, a
very, very unique strength that drives profitability.
Last but not least, Payments. In our Payments business, it's a large and growing and profitable industry. We have
a unique position. We're on both sides of the value chain. We will use this to become a global leader in Payments,
supported by our current franchise of 165 million customers and 100 million active payment card customers.
We're driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition. As of today, this is also allowing us to grow in the
open market because our products are competitive with the best. We have 16% of revenue coming from the open
market. And we expect this to continue to grow significantly in 2024 and beyond.
We are leveraging, again, as in the other divisions, and optimizing our use of CapEx to meet customer needs. In
our acquiring platform, Getnet, which is already number three in LATAM, is adapting to customers' payment
ecosystems. We're also deploying our Global Cards platform starting with Brazil, which again will drive significant
opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out.
Yeah, I want to just point to one specific number in PagoNxt where activity increased 15% to reach €36 billion of
total transactions, and very importantly, one of the key metrics we gave you on Investor Day, which is EBITDA
margin, which last year was 9%, 10%, has risen to 22% this year – sorry, 25%, almost 25% in 2023 already. So,
we are focused on growth. You'll see the numbers, but we're also focusing on profitability and we've done a big
improvement – achieved a big improvement this year.
So let me just give you a very specific example with the US of how these global platforms are being rolled out in
different countries. I mentioned it already briefly, but very important, the first technical integration of our
proprietary tech for consumer, which combines the ODS, i.e. the open bank frontend with our Gravity backend,
will be launched in the US in 2024. This is a fully digital savings account. We'll start with that.
In a year from now, in the first quarter of 2025, we'll complement this with the transactional offering. And really
important, this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business, including improving
profitability. And this is already showing in some of the numbers. One of the key metrics to look at is retail deposit
cost to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets, but we also
need the funding side.
I want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in the US. As you can see in the
screen, we're not a full retail commercial bank as we are in Mexico or Spain or some of the big US banks. We're a
consumer bank with a limited commercial, multifamily business. We are targeting to grow in segments where we
have local scale such as consumer, commercial again or we can leverage the contribution of the group such as
the CIB or Wealth.
Now, with the platform on the retail side, we will be much more efficient, and Héctor will share some of these big
numbers. You saw them at Investor Day. We are ahead of our plan in terms of improving efficiency on the retail
and deposit gathering side. And just as a closing remark, between 2019 and 2022, Santander US distributed to
our shareholders more than €8.3 billion in dividends. So, we are confident to reach our profitability targets of 15%
in the medium-term – in our medium-term plan.
So, let me just finish by summing up. I'm not going to go through the slide, but I want to give you a sense of these
five global businesses underweight in the Santander model. Just to reiterate the importance of retail and
consumer, this is 70% of our revenues. This is where we have the most upside, and we already are delivering on
some of these platforms. I'm not going to go through the others, but I just want to say that this model has already
7

delivered improving profitability and growth, 169 basis points improvement in our RoTE in 2023. Again, by moving
to these five global businesses, we'll unlock the full potential of our business model. It's all now going to be about
execution. And Héctor and I and all the teams are very focused on that. So, again, we aim to become, as I said,
the most profitable bank in each one of our markets.
So, Héctor will now take you through the performance in 2023.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ana. Good morning to everyone. Moving on to the income statement, remember that as we always
do, we present growth rates both in current and constant euros. As Ana already mentioned, we achieved a record
profit last year with double-digit revenue and net operating income growth, but we also have a very solid quarter,
with profit growing 1% in euros even after seasonal effects in Q4 from the deposit warranty formed, contribution in
Spain, and the bank levy in the UK, which represent around €210 million post-tax.
Underlying trends remained strong, as profit excluding the seasonal factors, will have grown about 8% in the
quarter. Differences between growth in euros and constant euros became more evident in the quarter as the
devaluation of the Argentine peso in December introduced some distortions across the P&L. Remember that the
full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in Q4. Excluding Argentina, profit would
have grown 7% in the quarter, including euros, and there is no material impact from other currencies. So, growth
in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines.
I will now take you through the main lines in the P&L in much more detail. Starting with the revenue, there was the
strong growth, driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue
and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. In the year, this was primarily supported by net interest income
in retail as we actively managed interest rates tailwinds in Europe and Mexico, and the positive fee performance
of CIB and Payments mainly in Latin America. Moreover, we have delivered double-digit revenue growth across
most of the businesses, especially those that benefit most from the network effects. Revenue in the corporate
center improved by more than BRL 1 billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and the lower impact from
the FX hedging.
NII continue to be the main driver of our revenue growth. In 2023, it was 16% higher year-on-year in constant
euros on the back of basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in the
Americas. In terms of profitability, we improved net interest margin year-on-year and every quarter even in Q4, if
we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in Argentina. This is mainly explained by higher yields on
assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment.
These gains from credit yields more than outweighted funding cost, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration
leading to our robust margin expansion. Going forward, we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher
through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in South America, while the positive
impact from interest rates in Europe starts to moderate. This is a great example of the power of the diversification
that we have.
Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee growth in general, as a result of subdued loan demand and weak
consumer activity, our net fee income grew 7% in constant euros compared to Q4 2022 and 5% year-on-year.
CIB and payments grew double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower
activity or market volatility, which again demonstrates the value of diversification. We saw a strong growth in CIB
8

across regions and products, while we strengthened our capabilities in the US. Total payments volume grew 22%
year-on-year, backed mainly by Brazil, Europe, and Mexico.
On the other hand, consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the US. In 2024, we
expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionality as we implement
our common platforms and reap the benefits from our new operating model, becoming the principal bank for our
customers.
Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%. Savings from One Transformation initiatives are
already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization. Costs, as you have seen, remained flat in real
terms in 2023 and driving the cost-to-serve, as Ana mentioned earlier. This is reflected in efficiency gains of
almost 2 percentage points in the year, led by Europe, which improved 5 percentage points driven by strong
revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms. In North America and DCB, costs increases likely in real terms,
reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects.
As mentioned, in Q4, efficiency ratio is always affected by the DGF change – charge, sorry. If excluded, efficiency
is 43.7%, fairly in line with that of Q3, despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter. We expect
that savings from One Transformation will become more evident in 2024 and onwards, which, together with a
positive revenue outlook, should result in further efficiency gains.
We are transforming the bank in the right way, because we are structurally changing our model to improve both
cost and revenue. The efficiencies we have captured from One Transformation and the impact of our active
spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 112 basis points in efficiency
improvements.
For example, in the US, we have already generated around $200 million in savings from transformation and
simplification initiatives. Our global and network businesses continued to contribute to the group profitability and
have delivered 28 basis points in efficiency gains in 2023 alone.
Multi-Latins and Multi-Europeans, our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through
our regional coverage model, grew at very high rates, with revenue increasing 40% in 2023 alone.
Finally, our global technology capabilities have already generated 32 basis points in efficiency so far. Our global
approach to technology has allowed us to capture €187 million savings this year, mainly driven by the deployment
of Gravity, new global agreements with vendors, and the implementation of new IT and Ops shared services.
Credit quality remained robust across all of our footprint and in the 2023 in line with our expectation, supported by
our prudent approach to risk, strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices mainly in the US. The NPL
ratio was stable and in line with expected levels. We met our cost of risk target ending 2023 below 1.2% despite
the impact of single name cases and additional provisions in Poland related to the Swiss franc mortgages.
Spain continues to perform well. NPL improving 21 basis points and cost of risk is stable year-on-year, supported
by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions, both metrics remained stable across the quarter.
In other European units, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels, and we expect it to remain below or in
line with through the cycle averages.
Normalization continues in the US and Mexico, in line with expectations and group credit quality trends are
[indiscernible] (00:31:23) in Brazil, as NPL ratio improved for the fourth quarter in a row and underlying cost for

risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions. Going forward, we don't foresee signs of significant quality
credit deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level.
As we have discussed in previous presentations, our portfolio is well-diversified by segment, product, and country.
Moreover, our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average
LTVs. In 2023, loans decreased 1% as higher rates reduced the credit demand and incentivized early
prepayments, which was especially evident in Europe.
Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America, and DCB. Deposits continued to grow well, up 2%
both year-on-year and in the quarter, as deposits inflows more than offset savings used to prepay the mortgages.
Growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates.
Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, around 75% of our deposits are
transactional, which are a lot stickier, and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits
warranty schemes.
Mutual funds rose 13% with broad-based growth across all countries, except the US, following a year of instability
in 2022.
Closing with the capital, we maintained a CET1 ratio of 12.3% in Q4. That's 0.2 percentage points up if we
exclude the impact from the new EBA guidelines related to the accrual of the share buybacks, driven by strong
growth – gross organic capital generation, sorry.
We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, and this was reflected in a front book
return on risk-weighted assets of 2.7%. That's up from 2.6% in 2022, equivalent to our RoTE in excess of 15%,
which will support profitability going forward.
Finally, we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization, improving the percentage
of RWAs with positive economic value-added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% by year
2025. These principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years, and
we are confident that our CET1 ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account the final
implementation of Basel III in 2025.
That's all from my side, Ana. Thank you. Over to you.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much, Héctor. So, let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions. So, three very
simple points. 2023 was a very strong year in our new phase of value creation. By the way, the best is yet to
come. We grew customers. We increased revenue and profits double-digit in all regions and businesses,
basically.
Second, a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model by One Transformation to One
Santander. There was also, of course, an improved operating context, especially for our retail business and
especially in Europe this year.
And point number three, we have further strengthened our already very strong balance sheet, increasing our
CET1 ratio, and very importantly with a very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our
10

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
expectations. Once again, all of this, of course, leading to the 15% growth in value creation and 21% increase in
EPS and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share buybacks.
So what this means, again, is we've delivered, once again, in all – on all our 2023 targets. We're on track to
achieve the 2025 goals that we communicated last year. And very important, as Héctor mentioned, you're just
seeing the initial results of our transformation in our 2023 results. You're going to see much more coming in the
next few years.
I want to emphasize, again, that not only do we have solid foundations. But these foundations are already proving
and our model that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth, increased returns to our shareholders,
leveraging our model. And taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer business is absolutely
critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years, because it depends on us.
So, our guidance for 2024 is 2024 will be an even better year for Santander. You can see here the numbers. We
are confident that our customer focus, diversification will be differential this year vis-à-vis our peers. We have
many engines and all of the engines are going strong, with different focuses in the regions. But all our global
businesses going strong. We'll continue to accelerate the implementation of our model in the retail and consumer
to deliver again on these targets.
Just very briefly, if you go down across the slide, we continue to see revenue growth mid-single-digit in 2024. This
will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses. You saw Héctor's presentation that
this was the opposite this year. [ph] This year (00:37:28), the consumer top line will be much stronger than this
year, will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in South America and Mexico with higher growth
than Europe. And very importantly, much higher fees in many of our global businesses than we saw this year,
driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers. Again, the One
Transformation will be absolutely key in delivering this, supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency.
In terms of cost of risk, we'll be roughly flat against this year on an underlying basis ahead of this year. We had
some one-offs this year. We said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite, and this
is still the case. There will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our
current economic forecast.
And finally, we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue, but very importantly, also on efficiency.
You can see we're continuing to target positive operating jaws with flattish costs for next year, leading to a cost-
income below 43% and a return on tangible equity of 16%.
So, we're now happy to take your questions. Again, thank you very much.

Thank you. Can we start the Q&A session and have the first question, which I believe is from Ignacio Ulargui?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ignacio Ulargui from
BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the presentation and taking my questions. I have two questions, if I may,
link a bit to the revenue growth target, the first one, which is when we look to the mid-single-digit revenue growth,
Ana, you have just gave a bit of clarity on that. But just wanted to give a bit of sense of what would be the driver of
the growth, NII or fees in that customer engagement that you were commenting before? And in terms of
businesses, which will be, in your view, the [ph] €1.5 billion (00:39:48) potential into 2024.
The second one is focused on cost. You've made a case for One Transformation throughout the presentation. I
would just like to get when you mentioned flattish cost, what should we looking for going forward? What is the
advantage that the global footprint will give Santander in terms of that in translating into cost growth? Efficiency
gain will continue towards, say it, 42% in 2025, which if I remember correctly, was the target of the strategic plan.
So, we are not yet at the end of the journey. We are just still in the process of getting there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sure. So, in terms of revenues, we, of course, delivered a very high – remember, we started a very strong year.
Our guidance for the three years was high-single-digit revenue, we delivered double-digit. What's very important
is that what you've seen this year is not just the context and the retail side in Europe, of course, with the higher
rates, but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses. You can see that, for example,
in our transactions per customer, which grew 10% year-on-year. As I said, the Retail Europe business has had
very strong tailwinds. We do expect this to continue. We have positive momentum in all our five global
businesses. I want to be clear on this. They're going to come from different regions and different sites. I'll give you
a high level and then maybe Héctor can give you a bit more detail.
So again, revenue growing at mid-single-digit. The high level summary of the drivers of this on revenue would be,
first, positive revenue growth in our retail business, very high double-digits in South America, Brazil, Chile with a
positive sensitivity to falling rates. You've seen that already in Q4 and, of course, very strong momentum in
Mexico.
If you look at the other important global business consumer, which this year suffered from the higher rates, this
year, it's exactly the opposite. So, you're going to see Consumer Europe and Consumer in the US with much
better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive
sensitivity to lower rates. Again, that's also going to be good for fees.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Overall, in fees, they're going to be driven, as Héctor said, by customer growth, increased transactionality, and
very important, as we implement these global platforms, you're going to see much more of that. But again, the
high-performing fee businesses will be corporate bank, will be payments. But maybe Héctor, you want to give a
couple of the highlights for – on revenues.
We'll take net interest income maybe in another question. Otherwise, it's going to be too long a reply. But net
interest income, we're also projecting that to rise, again, mostly in retail and consumer. But Héctor, why – you
want to give some more?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sure. Ignacio, thank you. Okay. I mean, you're going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail, CIB
and consumer, as Ana told. Mid-single-digit positive revenue growth in 2024. You're going to see a little bit of the
regions basically Europe moderating because of the rates and – but we don't expect the rates basically to go to
the levels of – that we had some time ago. You're going to see also that the main driver will be South America and
what's going on in Mexico. And then also you're going to see a good growth from – coming from the US, okay?
So, in that sense, you'll see also the consumer business globally [indiscernible] (00:43:22) both in Europe, in the
US should grow – benefited by credit growth and the progression repricing that we, okay? And you're going to see
in CIB higher income from financial transactions, all right? But asking your – I mean, answering your question in
terms of fee, we expect the fee income to grow and that's very important, as Ana was saying, supported by history
of being the number one bank for our customers. This is quite important. The moment that you become the
number one bank to your customer, fees, basically, and different revenue grows exponentially, and that's going to
help us quite a lot.
[ph] You can read (00:43:58) a lot about connectivity several times, but let me tell you why it's very important,
okay? Connectivity between the global businesses and platforms and the countries is the one that drives a strong
free generation, okay? That basically leads to double-digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in 2024 so
we can reach the mid- to high-single-digit growth ambition that we have on the fees, okay? So that's very
important.
And going to cost, I don't know, if I can comment pretty quickly or you want to comment on it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Let me just give a high level and then maybe...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
...you can give a little bit more detail. So, what's important in cost is that we want to do better in cost next year
than this year. We're aiming for, I would say, flattish cost. So the goal is to grow customers, grow top line, have
positive operating leverage or flattish cost that is below 43% by the end of 2024. You also said, how do we see it
in 2025? Obviously, we see it better. We – as I said, we intend to go step-by-step, sustainably getting better.
13


Banco Santander SA

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
We've had big improvements in 2023, 2024. We expect also improvements in 2025 and reaching, at least, our
target, if not better.
I'm not changing the guidance. I'm just saying we should do better than that. So I want to be clear on that. But,
yes, we see many more benefits. So – and I want to again insist on the structural change in the model, and that is
what One Transformation is allowing us to do. We're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio, but a cost to serve the
customer. We see a very, very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second
half of the year, and we hope to carry that. We have positive momentum in all our markets.
And again, as I – I used the example of the US, because the US is the place where we have an [ph] at-scale
(00:45:47) Auto business. But with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks, we will get to be very
competitive on the asset – sorry – on the deposit gathering side. You saw in the slide that Héctor showed that we
had targeted around €400 million in savings in our consumer business in the US by 2025. We've delivered €200
million this year. We are, of course, investing. Investments in the US, transformation will not be as large next year.
So, you are going to see a much better performance for the US as a whole in 2025.
But what I said before, we will migrate our existing retail customers in 2025 to this new platform. So in 2025, and
again, this is only one example with the US, driven by One Transformation by the common platform that
technically is already up and running, we're just in the regulatory approval process. So, that should drive
increased efficiencies.
And then, again, in Héctor's slide, you saw that One Transformation is helping us across the board in many other
areas in technology. So, our investments – One Transformation investments in technology have reached €2.4
billion, but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform. So, again, we are –
we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and will get better.
You want to give a bit more on the One Transformation? I guess, I was...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. If you allow me complement, I think this is one very important bonding, Ignacio, to remember about. I
mean, One Transformation is not just about the platforms. There are two steps before it, which are quite important
where you'll see the impact on the cost. One is simplification. Have you have seen in one of Ana's slides, you saw
the amount of problems that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization, okay? So that's
very important. That's simplification.
Then the second is automation, which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically
have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our product in our apps, which basically allows us to
spend more time with clients selling product, et cetera, and also diminishing the cost. [ph] OT (00:48:02) means
better service user experience, less cost per transaction and client, more revenues, which is basically means
profitability. And then, you're going to see an inflection point that goes through 2024, 2025 when the platforms are
being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way.

Operator: Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. You've guided for UK NIM to be down in 2024. Can you
quantify how much NIM pressure you'd expect to materialize this year in the UK versus the Q4 exit rates? Or if it's
easier, express this in the percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023?
And, secondly, your structural hedge notional in the UK increased by €7 billion or 7% quarter-on-quarter. That
compares to a [ph] fall in current accounts at about (00:49:10) €1.6 billion. That's a little counterintuitive. Can you
explain that this is driven by growth in savings deposit or rather it is because you managed the structural hedge
using a dynamic rather than a caterpillar approach? And could you guide us please for how much change you
expect in the structural hedge notional in the UK in 2024? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, yes, let me just frame down in terms of the UK NIM in the context of our retail business. So again, our overall
retail business for 2024 will do better than 2023, driven more by the Americas in this case, both Latin America, but
also the US, because it's on the consumer side, actually.
So what's very important is, again, single – mid-single-digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue
growth overall with mid-single-digit growth overall, [ph] Damien (00:50:07), also for net interest income. Within
that, the UK, who this year has delivered a, I believe, 13% RoTE, will continue to be double-digit, but will be lower
profitability. So as you know, volumes and the top line net interest income, and I'll let Héctor and José give you a
bit more detail on that, but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability.
So, we have a very strong business in mortgages, very strong business in current accounts in the UK, at-scale
and competitive. And for 2024, we expect still double-digit profitability, but lower than this year. What's important,
and again, as we think about the One Transformation, that is going to help, maybe not as much as in other
countries next year and the US in terms of the top line, but it's going to help already on the cost side. So we're
guiding UK should be flattish cost next year with low cost of risk in a very, very strong balance sheet. And so
again, leading to lower profitability overall in the UK, but still double-digit RoTE.
So, in terms of – I don't know if you want to give a bit more detail on volumes or NIM in the UK?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sure. I will do so. But mainly, I think it's important to tell you a couple of things. As Ana said, basically, retail
represents the bulk of the business in the UK, mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have. We
anticipate, in terms of your question, in terms of cost, flattish cost, this is benefiting for the change of the model
that we're doing. And also, we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and
the focus on profitability that we're telling you, okay?
It's important to understand that high rates and economic slowdown are continuing to affect the loan volumes and
the market deposit growth continued to be subdued, okay? So, in 2024, we anticipate a challenging competitive
environment as the one that you saw during the third and fourth quarter, with rates on deposits growing through
the year and across all the banks, which is basically what's going on there.

Mortgage rates have started to fall since December 2023. You saw that, following a drop in the market swap rates
and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then. So, we see a little bit changes in
the volume. The outlook is driven by an increased competition also, which we'll keep focusing on profitability, as
Ana basically said, and we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost at better levels and to
find new revenue streams.
Of course, as I said, flattish. And as a result, we anticipate a slightly lower RoTE. But I don't know, José, if you
want to [ph] bid (00:52:54) exact details?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. No. On the hedge, in the structural hedge, no. I think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis, it
very much, it may suffer some volatility due to maturities, et cetera. If we at the structural hedge in December
2022, it was £108 billion. It is now £106 billion. And at that time, the duration was 2.5 years and it's 2.4 years.
That shows it's very stable. We would expect it to keep it stable. This is structural. So, we would not use the
hedge to bring forward profits. But again, this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain
stable, and like you said, linked to our interest rate sensitivity, basically coming from the current accounts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Next question is from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Antonio Reale Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. I have two questions, please. One on the guidance for this year
and one on strategy. So, you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 at 16% RoTE, which implies a net profit of more
than €12 billion on current tangible book value. And this one has been growing. So, we hope that continues. So,
you'd be implicitly guiding between €12 billion and €12.5 billion net profit this year, which will be – I mean, will be
a strong number if delivered.
And I won't ask you to confirm if that's right, but it will be great if you could talk us through how you see the main
units performing this year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the US? Actually, when you talk about Europe, if you
could comment about Spain and the UK, given the weakness this quarter that I think would help.
And my second question is on strategy. So, you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the US. Now
over the years, we've seen a few of European and international peers have ambitions changed their allocation of
capital in their CIB businesses in the US, which has almost systematically resulted in negative jaws and higher
capital consumption. Can you talk of through what your expectations are here, please, and possibly share with us
some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So in terms of the guidance, again, we're not going to give specific numbers, but you can do the math. I think
what's important in terms of how we see revenues, profits, costs, et cetera, is that the key here is the operating
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
leverage. So as I said, this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model. This is
really important, because, obviously, we have a lot more control. We control the top line to a certain degree, but
there's some external impacts. And so, what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model,
so we have a structurally lower cost to serve. So we're going to work very hard on both of those.
As you know, we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business. So if you allow me, I'm going to
give you the vision by global business, because this is really how we manage, this is how we predict. We have
been managing this way forever, by the way, at the country level. So we've been predicting retail, commercial by
country. It's not anything different. We're now just putting that together and working together in a common
business model that Héctor explained in detail.
So, again, we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 2024. This is really important. So, we expect
revenue growth in all our businesses. Retail, commercial, DCB in terms of NII is 80%. So, it's obviously very
important. Both our retail, commercial and DCB should grow mid-single-digit. Again, our retail, commercial, as I
said, will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe. But with the exception of the UK, the top line will grow
in all the countries, including Spain. So, revenues will continue to grow in Spain, Poland, Portugal. So, again, very
diversified and I would say, very strong momentum, in some cases more now fees than net interest income.
Héctor mentioned on the retail, commercial side, fees were negative to flattish in 2023. It should be much more
positive in 2024, including in Europe, by the way, because there's more activity. We're seeing positive signs
already in the last few months that activity is picking up. So fees should grow in retail, commercial.
What's going to be doing better, and Héctor and I mentioned that already, is our consumer business, DCB, and
that is both in Europe and in the US. So, again, here, both net interest income and revenue growth should also
continue to grow. Fees growing much faster because of higher activity. So again, very balanced across all the
businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more
sensitive – positive, sensitive – positive sensitivity to the lower rates.
The Corporate Investment Bank will continue to grow very well, mostly on fees. As you've seen there, we've put
specifically some operating metrics that show that we're not planning to increase the size of the business. We just
wanted to be more profitable, but not the size in terms of capital. So that should remain basically where it is today.
It's a 13% of our revenues, but the composition of our business is really different from our peers. So, a lot of
transactional banking, a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business
with. I mean, both Héctor and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this
new context, right?
So, we're very, very focused on what you said of playing to our strengths, of not doing what we are not either the
best or could be the best at and leveraging on our corporate relationships which are incredibly strong across Latin
America, Europe and increasingly the US. So, that is really the focus of the strategy there.
In terms of more specific guidance on specific countries, I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if
you want some more. Thank you.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you for the presentation. Quick couple of questions for me [indiscernible] (00:59:49) I'm sorry if you've
touched on this already, feel free to refer to the call because I couldn't connect [ph] contiguousantly (00:59:57).
The thing is that fee income is the area where you have sort of under-delivered. You promised a stronger growth
[indiscernible] (01:00:06) by mid-single digits in 2023. I would like to understand why do you think that was the
case and why are you bullish for 2024 where you again expect to grow by high-single digits? I understand the
hiring in the US. But other than that, what is driving that strong growth across the board?
And the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer versus retail, just the qualitative
comparative, we're looking at similar cost income ratios in both segments where in theory we would expect the
digital consumer to be a more efficient business line than retail with the network. Could you explain to what extent
the cost income ratio in the Digital Consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development, and what will
be a more normalized cost income ratio? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So let me just very briefly answer the second question. You're totally right, there is a lot of upside in our consumer
business. Remember that this is mostly Europe, but also the US. So we invested a lot in this, especially on the
retail side – sorry, on the – well, it's retail and consumer. The bank side is exactly the same backend. But you're
totally right, so that should improve a lot next year. So we're actually targeting lower cost absolutely for our
consumer bank, again, driven not just by Europe but also by the US. So, yes, absolutely, that is a big goal we
have.
Fees, so, again, we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said, but we're going to deliver because
diversification, because we're working on different angles, and so you're going to get some lags. One of the
reasons our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity especially in Europe in some markets, and that is
a big driver of fees. We're targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year. So from zero growth
this year, as you saw in Héctor's presentation, that should be up maybe not much. We're expecting fees to be
much higher in our consumer bank. Again, and as we said, our diversification is a huge strength. It's differential
against most of our peers, if not all of them. So, as rates stabilize and come down, you're going to see a much
better performance in our consumer business, not just on the costs side as I just explained, but also in revenue
growth, net interest income and fees. And fees should be high-single digit in our Consumer Bank which is pretty
big.
And, yes, absolutely, our Corporate Investment Bank should grow fees much faster. That is one of the goals. That
is one of the reasons that we brought the team, we brought in the US, because they can help us grow fees on the
back of our existing customer relationships. So you're going to see CIB fees doing as well or maybe a bit better
than this year, double-digit for sure. And you're going to see a lot of that in the US. Again, so you will see the US
as a country, both consumer doing better, CIB doing better, the whole of the US going to above double-digit
returns next year.
But, again, you're going to see, hopefully – not hopefully, you'll see Payments also doing very well this year and
next year and Wealth Management doing better next year than this year. So that is the reason we are confident
that our fees will improve more in 2024.

Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi, this is Sofie from JPMorgan. So my first question would be on US asset quality. If I look at the NPL ratio
in the US, it increased from 4.2% to 4.6%. Coverage fell from 73% to 68%. Cost of risk in the fourth quarter was
250 basis points. If I look at the second-hand car value, they've dropped over 30% in peak value. And in addition,
you're doing more EV financing as far as I can see, given the tax rate. Given that you had Hertz dumping 20,000
EV vehicles in the US, I think up to 80% discounts. And the second-hand car prices coming down so much and
asset quality already showing signs of deterioration, how should we think about the cost of risk in the US going
forward? And if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is?
And then my second question would be on the corporate center. As far as I can see, the first time you make a
profit in the corporate center is inside the Global Financial Crisis. You also made a positive net interest income in
the corporate centers. So, how should we think about the contribution from the corporate center going forward?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me take a couple of these high-level, and then I'll pass to José and Héctor. But in terms of asset quality,
I want to say we've seen no signs of asset quality deterioration at all. We are guiding and we're confident that cost
of risk will stay around 1.2%. That is probably a through-the-cycle number roughly. So could be lower, could be a
bit higher, but should be 1.2%. We're not seeing really – we had said previously 1% through the cycle. We have a
bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets. But, we haven't given this. But I'd say – and maybe José
wants to address that, but I'd say around 1.2%.
What's important is that – and this is not just Europe, but it's mostly Europe, our balance sheet is very low risk and
highly secured. In the case of Europe, a lot of that is mortgages. So, 33% actually of our total balance sheet is
subprime mortgages with very low average LTVs. We're not anticipating a big change in those numbers, maybe a
few basis points, yes. That's why we – as you know, the 113 basis points is the underlying. So we do have some
space to grow there. But this really is about basis points. And the big driver, and that's the reason we're not
seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios, is that we had record-low unemployment. And this is the biggest
driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet.
So, again, we are confident the economy will remain resilient. If you look at the latest, actually to-date, the IMF
just upgraded growth especially for Spain and some of our key economies. And then, our consumer portfolios,
and maybe Héctor wants to comment a bit more on the US, but yes, there will be some normalization. But to be
honest, everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios. Brazil is trending down. The
US is normalizing as we expected. There will be some normalization in consumer next year, but very much within
the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year.
I'll let Héctor answer on that. But let me just address the corporate center, maybe that's for José, but just to say
that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center. So, in the corporate
19

center, for example, we place our excess liquidity with ECB. Then we have transfer pricing. And so, again, you
should see some of that, and I'll let the detail for José in the context of our commercial business, for example, in
the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal. Again, part of that is, let's say, more financial, and part of that is
depending on how you choose. And our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try
to have a more market-based transfer pricing. And so you can see the actual commercial business. And so some
of those financial benefits of higher rates, sometimes, in our case, as you've seen this year, go to the corporate
center.
So, maybe you want to take the US, maybe orders. And then. José, you want to also expand on the corporate
center?

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A

Sure. Sofie, I mean, really quickly in the US [indiscernible] (01:08:23) that we have has shown a very robust
growth in 2023. Sales volume are €26 billion. It's basically helped by the new relationship we have with some new
OEMs that we have included in the portfolio. And we have, as you know, a continued dominance in the subprime
used car segment, which we are the leaders in the market.
This volume basically rebounded, as you have seen, on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained.
Okay. And also compensated for some declines from volumes that we had in other OEMs, okay. And then you
basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with delinquencies and losses
increasing seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter, but still below the pre-pandemic
levels, okay. So we expect the performance to continue through 2024 and we see lower world rates of charge-offs
and lower delinquencies driving that of the shift that we have to prime loans and near-prime loans and generally
US – recovery in the US economy. So, I wouldn't say recovery, but robust US economy. New vehicle prices
basically continue to be higher than pre-pandemic period and US prices are falling, but they continue to be higher
than four years ago and also are being supported by the sort of robust recovery rate that we have. Remember
that I explained last quarter about after 90 days delinquencies were still below pre-pandemic levels at around, I
mean, 67% compared to above 90%.
So our outlook for 2024 is a positive on the US auto. Sales growth in both loans and leases and the sustained net
income delivery, as losses basically stay below the historical term. So, we don't expect basically cost of risk to
deteriorate in the US of that.

Sofie, the NII of the corporate center. The NII of the corporate center basically comes from the relationship
between the corporate center with the balance sheet in Spain. And there are two different balance sheets in
Spain. One is the commercial balance sheet in Spain, and we make it like an independent bank. So we charge to
Spain the TLAC/MREL costs, we charge the financing of the ALCO portfolio and a couple of other things.
So net commercial Spain balance sheet, we charge around €1.4 billion for those items. And then we also have a
CIB balance sheet in Spain, that's group CIB booked in Spain plus the branches. Like an asset, we isolate the
CIB business from interest rate risk. So, there is an intra-group transfer pricing for the CIB business that is in the
balance sheet of Spain, and that's around €800 million. So, although we remunerate the commercial GAAP, in
Spain you see a commercial GAAP, that is the difference between loans of €228 billion and deposits of €308
billion. The difference is €80 billion. We remunerate that GAAP at the central bank rate, but then we charge these
items that I explained, making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIB against the DTI. So obviously when
20

rates are up, we have at the corporate center higher income from the DTI coming from CIB. As rates will come
down, that should also come down.

Operator: Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra Equities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Good morning. I want to ask about the capital. The RoTE 60% [indiscernible] (01:12:24) 50% payout ratio,
but yet the capital built is limited in 2024 as per your guidance. So, I wonder what are the regulatory impacts that
we should expect, if any or what are the moving parts impacting the 2024 capital ratios?
And second here is the 12% capital target. The SREP CET1 has been raised by 75 basis points in the last two
years to 9.6%. So, regulators would also impose further countercyclical buffers. So, in this context, do you think
that the 12% capital target post-Basel IV is still valid or would you be looking to increase this part over time?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, in terms of capital, we are very comfortable with our level of current capital. It's over 12%, not 12%. And just
very important, it's over 12% fully-loaded after Basel III. So, again, really important that we are comfortable. We
have ample buffers in terms of the regulatory requirements.
The second point is that every year we're generating more and more capital organically. We are a compounder or
we're adding to equity, and we're investing in profitable growth for the future, and this is really important. So this is
allowing us enough capital to grow. We have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of
rotation of the balance sheet. So, as you can see, the net RWA growth last year was zero, but increasing the front
book profitability.
And so, again, we are aiming to, in terms of capital build this year, on a like-for-like basis, we went from 12% to
12.50%. We're now accruing the buyback in December. So that means 12.30%. That goes up from 12% and
that's after increasing the payout to 50%, as you know, from 40%. So, again, we're generating more and more
capital. We generated €10 billion of capital this year. It's much, much larger than the last few years.
We continue to aim, as you've seen, to grow profitability next year, which should increase the capital generation
and give us space to both fund our growth, increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we
generate more capital. And next year, we will have the Basel III. But the number that we are projecting for the end
of this year is 12.40% to 12.50% from the 12.30% for the end of 2024. We expect that number to be exactly the
same on day one. Again, 12.40%, 12.50% by the end of the year. And on day one in January, the same. The final
impact in 2028, we estimate 25 basis points, 30 basis points. So, that would mean that on January 1, 2025, we
would be compliant already with a fully-loaded down the road with a 12.40%, 12.50% that I'm saying.
Anything else on the requirement you want to say on the P2R and P2G, because?

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No, [ph] Pancho (01:15:36) very quickly, we will generate between 10% to 15% of organic capital per quarter, and
we expect to have around 30, 35 basis points of regulatory charges, of which 20 basis points will be up, I mean,
front-load in Basel III. So that's why by the end of December 2024, the ratio that we will publish will be already
fully Basel III compliant, as Ana just explained. And the capital ratio of 12.40% to 12.50% will be the same on
December 31 and on January 1, 2025, because we will not have any impact from Basel III on day one. That
impact will be absorbed in 2024.
And in terms of the 12% and headroom?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, we're, I believe, one of the few European banks that under the stress test doesn't breach MDA. I mean,
there's not very many. The headroom is very comfortable. We have hundreds of basis points. I never know if
we've given this number or not. But we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy
our economic, our risk appetite and the regulators. So, we are comfortable with our position and will be even
better on a nominal basis, which, again, we don't think that is the only number we should look at. But on a nominal
basis, 12 months from now, we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis-à-vis our
peers.

Operator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
First question is on the NII prospect. Have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the NII
trajectory, in terms of the geographies? Can you please update us on your net interest income sensitivity with the
forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration?
The second is a more conceptual question. You hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus
on profitability while capital is growing. Yet, consensus estimates are hesitant to meet your guidance and
valuation stays undemanding. What do you say to the skeptics on Santander? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
What I say to the skeptics, look – and what I tell everybody every time to evaluate something is look at the
numbers, look at the track record. If you look at our track record, that's why I showed a slide. By the way, the NII
we'll answer – Héctor we will answer that on the hedge. But, basically, it's – I think we have gotten some
recognition this year, way we need – way, way more. Absolutely. We had distributed to shareholders 10% of our
market value, €5.5 billion. That is five times to shareholders what we gave nine years ago. But very importantly,
22


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
on a per share basis, as we said this year, we are up 50% as we increase the payout, 50% cash dividend per
share. I mean, any number you look at is at the group level is I think, sorry to say this, but impressive.
But very importantly, we see a lot more upside in the next few years. So, what I would say is just look at the
numbers and that's what we are doing. Look at our track record, look at our model, look at our diversification. I
think it's going to be and – as we are preparing for this call, if you look at the group by global business, it's a much
more simple to understand group. But very importantly, by managing the bank now by five global business, we
have a lot more upside for many more years. And this is the key. The market will see this year, we are launching
our own tech platform in the US. This is totally differential for the US, of course, but also for the group. There is
and this is really important, a plan to deploy as Héctor said, common business model, common operating model,
and common tech in both our Retail Bank and our consumer bank. So, as well, you know the numbers. Your
recommendations are higher. I think you're still way short, by the way, of how we see things, but that's fine. So,
we are not even half as bullish as we are. We own a lot of shares.
And I think just to answer the last question, the market tends to look and this is the feedback we got from a couple
of long-term Santander investors. They look at us through the rearview mirror and if you look at Santander
through the rearview mirror, the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension are
not all our peers, but our goal is to outperform all our peers. Don't get me wrong, is 2023. And what they tell us is,
you need two years of consistency and you will see that. I am very confident we will see that. Héctor and I are
working together really well. We like what we do. We believe in this company. We have a great team. We just
announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run our Openbank platform.
We're going to deploy our national digital platform in the US this year. All our customers from our current Retail
Bank in the US will be on the new platform in 2025. So just, we'll keep on delivering and we'll keep on buying
shares at 18% ROI. So, I'm sure this is something which we'll get to. And, José, can you answer on the structural
hedging?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Andrea, [indiscernible] (01:21:28) prospect sensitivity et cetera. Yeah. You're right. We had a hedging of
our [indiscernible] (01:21:34) mortgages which is basically expired already. It will expire in – by April, it will expire.
So, the sensitivity that we're going to have next year, it's going to be this – the actual sensitivity of the portfolio.
There are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity. One is, let me give you the sensitivity to a
drop, a parallel drop of 100 basis points. In Spain, it would be minus €1 billion. All things being equal. Another
way of looking at it is the way you post the question, which is, if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits,
meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024, which is probably not
realistic. NII is positive around €500 million. Okay. So, we will still have positive repricing next year with cost of
deposits remaining flat. But again, that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion. So, I give you the minus €1
billion, 100 basis points drop plus €500 million with cost of deposits flat.

Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two very quick ones. The first one is, if you can give
us your best approximation of what to expect from Argentina in terms of earnings in 2024? And the second one, if
you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the UK, and if you can give us your
view of how that discussion basically can develop and what kind of restructuring charges or impairments actually
you might have to face in 2024 and 2025 on the basis of this? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, Argentina, our bank in Argentina is doing incredibly well. Obviously, the exchange rate has meant a few basis
points of effect on our capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers. I believe for next year, and how we are going
to report is going to be leaving Argentina in current, so you can get a better view of what really is going on. So,
this is really important. We report in constant. When you look at the performance of the business, but will leave
Argentina in current. In terms of the P&L, it's not really material except for this volatility across the – from. And the
effect on capital was a few basis point I think 2 basis points, 3 basis points in Q4, Argentina. We're not
anticipating nothing very different for the next year.
In terms of the UK, it's still early days. It would not be significant. I mean, we – [ph] I'm going to say (01:24:23)
[indiscernible] (01:24:24) significant, we don't really know but it should not be a big number because it's not a
really big portfolio. FCA is looking into it. So, nothing really that right now we're concerned about.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, hopefully. On Brazil, obviously, very strong growth in NII.
Can you maybe talk us through that strong growth? I see the cards seen a pickup in growth. Maybe you can
update us where you are in that card growth strategy versus your – the run rates you've given us in the past? And
will the 100% cap on rate – on loan rates, how will that affect you in 2024?
And second, very quick one, can you give us what tax rate you're assuming for your 2024 and 2025 targets? And
any color you can give us, in particular, in Brazil, in the US, how to think about in those two regions? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, let me answer as there's quite a few questions. I'm going to answer very high level, and we can then address
some of the others in the coming quarters. But, basically, Brazil is, as you've seen, is doing exactly what we
predicted in the last few quarters. We're expecting a much higher profitability in 2024, in the high-teens actually.
Costs actually growing less in line or even a bit below inflation, given the One Transformation, which is already
having effects in Brazil. We can grow and actually grow our cost base less because we're investing together.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Revenue growth, net interest income, between double-digit and yeah, all double-digit growth in all the top line and
efficiency ratio improving again. So, very strong performance anticipated for 2024 across all the different global
businesses, but driven by Retail and consumer.
In terms of the tax rate and cards, just I don't think – anything you want to say about cards. All I can say about
cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago, actually 18 months ago. You're seeing that in the cost of risk in
the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down. We're anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year and that
is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards. We will start to grow again. But, again, the growth in Brazil is
across all the global businesses, not just the Retail, but also the consumer, CIB, and all the others. In terms of the
tax rate for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. I mean, just one comment on growth in Brazil. If you look at the consumer finance, which includes everything
in Brazil this year, it was the portfolio together with CIB that grew the least, just 2.2%. And, obviously, as rates
come down, that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average. So, we are expecting more or
less very low double-digit growth in loans in Brazil next year. This portfolio should grow a little bit more than the
average and we would expect corporate loans, corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average. So,
that shows the changing mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion. Together with
this interest sensitivity that we have to rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. On the tax rate, I don't know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards, you can follow up, José or Begoña.
But there is an effect on the tax rate from the – which is actually a business – a business line or business quality
revenue because of the electric vehicles in the US. You're seeing that some of that already in Q4. It's actually, as
I say, it's a business, but you're seeing that through the tax line. So, that maybe we want to give some color on
that later on.

Marta Sanchez Romero Q

Thank you very much. My first question. Do you expect positive jaws in the US in 2024? And then I guess you are
in 2025 [indiscernible] (01:28:46) 2024. And then second, following up on your strategy in the UK, you're
shrinking. You're saying that you are going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposits, but you expect good
platforms to act with the revenue line over time. I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the
endpoint in the UK is because I think [indiscernible] (01:29:13) banks. You got the deposits, you give mortgages
in a very challenging, in a very competitive environment [ph] so unless you (01:29:22) grow money into your UK
business, you're not going to do anything. So, what is the plan? Thank you.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, the answer on the US, yes, absolutely. We're expecting positive jaws in the US. So, we are basically growing
the top line in revenues. More or less flat fees, efficiency ratio improving, cost flat to flattish, I would say
[indiscernible] (01:29:49) is actually a 12% going up in quite a significant way. So, yes, absolutely positive jaws in
the US.
In terms of the UK strategy, and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries and these are the UK and
the US where our US, we call it it's in Retail because you have current accounts and mortgages. But I would say
it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, and that is really the
strategy. So, Héctor is working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams, making sure they get the
benefit of the global platform so we can actually focus on profitability. So, we are not, as you say, I think you used
the word throwing. We never throw capital around with total respect. We are superefficient and we're focused on
profitability, not just in the UK, but across. And we are putting, as you can see, more capital at work in a more
profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets. Very important, this is a very granular work that is
actually led by Héctor and José, where we – we're not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and
certain businesses as on profitability. UK is one of them.
So again, full focus on profitability. You can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain, for example. You can
see that in the front book that Héctor showed. The front book this year is above 2%, 2.3% [indiscernible]
(01:31:13) if I remember correctly. We are being very disciplined again, not just by countries and global
businesses, even by portfolios. And this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more, if
possible, in the next few years.

You've added 5 million customers to 165 million. The target is 200 million until 2025. To what extent this is
depending on the rollout of the fully digital offering and to what extent will that then backlog some of the revenue
growth that you expected to see until 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, yes, absolutely. In our consumer bank, especially, the deployment of the platforms including [indiscernible]
(01:32:49) and Europe, should drive a much faster, more customer growth in the next few years. But very
important sometimes, I mean, our definition of customers is net customers. So, some of our peers get gross
customer. We get net customers. And so again, as we improve and Héctor mentioned that several times. As we
improve our service, our experience, and become the number one bank, customer rotation should be less on the
retail side. We should accelerate the consumer growth. But in any case, the revenues, we are very confident we
can deliver those revenues. Whether and again think that the revenues are coming with the active customers
more than total customers. So, total customers drives revenues, but is much more direct correlation between
active customers being the number one bank. And that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chair & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, I think there's a few more, if you don't mind, Begoña and the team will address those. Again thank you all very
much. I just want to reiterate, Héctor and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about our continued
delivery on our targets, and we see an even better 2024 for Santander. Thank you very much.
