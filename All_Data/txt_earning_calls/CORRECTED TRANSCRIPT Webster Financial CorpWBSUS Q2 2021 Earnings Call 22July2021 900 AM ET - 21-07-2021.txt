Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
While some uncertainties related to the virus remain, data is positive in the Northeast and we remain optimistic
about the positive economic and social activity trends across our footprint. We continue to forecast more robust
economic activity in the second half of 2021 but are always prepared should the path of the virus take an
unexpected turn.
The second quarter of 2021 was a terrific quarter for this company on all fronts. Our financial performance was
solid including strong loan growth, positive credit metrics and continued expense management. We are executing
on the strategic initiatives from our comprehensive organizational review
delivering incremental revenue and making significant progress towards our fourth quarter 2021 cost savings
target. And lastly, the Sterling merger integration planning and design has gone very well since announcing our
partnership in April. We are confident in our ability to deliver on the financial metrics previously disclosed as we
build a powerhouse Northeast banking franchise.
Starting on slide 2, we delivered strong business performance in the quarter. Excluding PPP, we grew loans by
3% or 12% annualized with $2.3 billion in total loan originations. Transactional and total deposits continue to
grow, and we enter the second half of the year with increasingly favorable and strong credit, capital and liquidity
positions.
Our adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $1.21, up from $0.57 a year ago. Our second quarter performance
includes $18 million of pre-tax charges related to the merger and our strategic initiatives. Glenn will provide
additional perspective on these charges during his remarks.
An improved economic outlook along with favorable asset quality supported the $21.5 million CECL allowance
release in the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted return on common equity was nearly 14% and the adjusted
return on tangible common equity was 17%.
Turning to slide 3. Reported loans grew 0.8% linked quarter or 3.2% when you exclude PPP loans. PPP loans
decreased $462 million as a result of net forgiveness activity in the quarter. Excluding those PPP loans,
commercial loans grew 3.8%, more than $500 million from prior quarter and were up almost 4% from a year ago.
This was a very strong quarter for commercial banking with $1.6 billion of loan originations, up solidly from Q1
and a year ago, when excluding PPP. Loan fundings of $1 billion doubled Q1 when we exclude the PPP loans.
In Commercial Banking, we continue to benefit from our industry expertise and deep relationships across all
chosen sectors. In this quarter, commercial loan growth was driven primarily by growth across our entire middle
market franchise and sponsor and specialty verticals. Consumer loans grew 1.9% or $120 million from first
quarter and declined 5.7% compared to prior year. The linked-quarter increase reflected seasonally strong
purchase mortgage activity during the traditional home-buying season. Overall, residential mortgage activities
drove $800 million of consumer loan originations, up solidly from Q1 and from a year ago.
I'm now on slide 4. Deposits grew 9.5% year-over-year, while deposit costs continue to decline and were 7 basis
points in the quarter. Commercial bank deposits are up more than 14% from a year ago, resulting from
municipalities and excess liquidity among clients across all lines of business and all geographies.
Retail Banking deposits grew 7.2% year-over-year with consumer and small business deposits growing 5.8% and
16.7%, respectively. Retail deposit costs continued to decline and totaled just 7 basis points in the quarter. We've
seen more positive trends in our HSA business as we begin to return to pre-pandemic business activity levels.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Core new account openings were 17% higher from the prior year, driven primarily by a rebound in our existing
direct-to-employer business. Overall core accounts grew 3.3% year-over-year with strong core deposit balance
growth of 11.8%. Total footings grew 19%year-over-year, supported by growth in investment balances.
Interchange revenue at HSA was up 28% year-over-year as consumer spending on healthcare has returned to
pre-pandemic levels in the quarter, a trend we see as a positive sign for our business overall.
HSA deposit costs were 9 basis points, down 6 basis points on a year-over-year basis as we remain disciplined in
this low interest rate environment. I'd also like to note in the quarter that TPA accounts and balances declined
$38,000 and $120 million, respectively, compared to the first quarter. These TPA accounts, which we disclosed
previously, continue to attrite at a slower pace than originally anticipated.
Moving to slide 5. I'll provide an update on the integration process related to the merger. As shared on the call in
April, this combination drives diversification, scale, and unlocks significant revenue growth opportunities across
our differentiated commercial businesses, health savings, and consumer banking businesses. Working closely
together with Jack Kopnisky and bankers across both organizations, we continue to reaffirm the complementary
nature of our companies from a business and culture standpoint. We remain focused on using the elements of
both companies' business attributes and cultures to build a distinctive and results-oriented organization.
We've begun executing on a comprehensive integration plan guided by four overarching strategic principles: one,
value creation by delivering on the merger economics we set forth in April; two, customer-first by focusing on
client engagement and retention of customers and clients through the process; three, conversion and continuity
by leveraging a positive and forward-thinking integration mentality; and four, risk mitigation by managing
execution risk and delivering on a robust risk management framework.
We've established an integration office and named leaders to govern work streams and manage integration
planning activities across all business lines and functions. We are leveraging the appropriate internal and external
resources to ensure a successful integration.
As shown on the time line, we achieved several key milestones including naming our executive team. The
regulatory approval process remains on track and our shareholder meeting related to the merger will occur on
August 17. We continue to expect the transaction to close early in the fourth quarter. We're making significant
progress on this combination and I can tell you that the Webster team is even more excited about this
combination today than we were on the announcement date.
Webster and Sterling are individually strong performers and, together, we are creating a differentiated best in
class commercial banking powerhouse. We've outlined the strong value we're creating for our shareholders and
we know there is tangible and material revenue upside, as we get to legal day one and begin to deliver for our
clients and customers across the broader geographic footprint.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn for the financial review in more details.

Thanks, John. I'll focus on key aspects of performance in the quarter, which included strong loan growth,
improved credit performance and further progress on our strategic initiatives. I'll begin with our average balance

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Average securities declined $55 million or less than 1% linked quarter. Securities represented 26% of total assets
at June 30. During the quarter, we purchased approximately $600 million in securities with a yield of 1.59% and a
weighted duration of five years. Securities called, matured, or paid down totaled around $500 million with a yield
of 2.24%. Average excess liquidity being held at the Fed totaled $1.3 billion and increased $590 million on
average linked quarter. This was driven by an increase in consumer and commercial transactional deposits.
Average loans declined $68 million or 0.3% linked quarter, primarily driven by $163 million in lower PPP loans.
During the quarter, forgiveness on PPP loans totaled $532 million. In Q2, we recognized $10.6 million of PPP
deferred accretion and the remaining deferred fee balance totaled $31 million at June 30. Excluding PPP,
average commercial loans grew $161 million or 1.2%, while consumer loans declined $66 million or 1%.
While average loans declined, period-end loans adjusted for PPP forgiveness grew by $636 million or 3.2%. The
growth reflects a 26% increase in total originations from the prior quarter, driven by higher commercial real estate
and residential mortgage activity. Average deposits grew $446 million or 1.6% linked quarter. The increase was
driven by consumer and commercial transactional deposit products, resulting from government stimulus
payments, round two PPP loan fundings and customer liquidity. The growth in transactional deposits was partially
offset by a decline in higher-cost CDs.
Average borrowings declined by $21 million from Q1. Borrowings represented 3.6% of total assets at June 30,
compared to 9.2% a year ago. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 74% at June 30. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio
decreased 24 basis points linked quarter to 11.65%, driven by the increase in commercial and residential loans.
Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 7.91% and would be 21 basis points higher, excluding $800 million
and 0% risk-weighted PPP loans. And tangible book value grew 2% linked quarter and 5.8% from prior year.
Slide 7 highlights our GAAP performance and adjustments to reported income available to common. During the
quarter, we recognized $16.8 million of after-tax charges related to the merger and another $800,000 from our
strategic initiatives. On an adjusted basis, income available to common was $109 million or $1.21 per share,
resulting in a 13.9% return on average common equity and a 17% return on tangible common equity.
On slide 8, we provide our reported to adjusted income statement. Net interest income declined by $3 million
linked quarter, reflecting a quarter-over-quarter decline of $5 million in PPP fee accretion, partially offset by lower
funding costs of $1 million and one additional calendar day. NIM of 2.82% declined 10 basis points from prior
quarter split between the lower PPP fees and increased liquidity held at the Fed.
As compared to prior year, net interest income declined by $3.6 million. This was the result of lower market rates
which reduced net interest income by $21 million and was partially offset by $17 million in lower deposit and
borrowing costs.
Non-interest income decreased $4 million linked quarter primarily driven by fair value adjustments of $5 million on
customer derivatives due to decline in forward interest rate curves and lower mortgage banking fees, partially
offset by higher deposit service fees. Compared to prior year, non-interest income grew by $12.6 million. This
reflects an increase of $5.6 million in deposit service fees driven by higher debit transaction volume, up 33% in
HSA Bank and 15% in the retail bank. In addition, non-interest income growth included the fair value adjustments
on customer derivatives, higher wealth and HSA fee income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue.
Adjusted non-interest expense declined $9.9 million from prior quarter, reflective of continued progress on our
strategic initiatives which I'll discuss on an upcoming slide. Versus prior year, non-interest expense declined $7.8

million due to lower compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, professional service fees, and deposit
insurance.
Pre-provision revenue was $125 million in Q2. This compares to $122 million in Q1 and $108 million in prior year.
Our CECL provision in the quarter reflects a benefit of $21.5 million which I'll discuss later in more detail. The
adjusted tax rate was 23.7%, an increase of 156 basis points linked-quarter, driven by an increase in estimated
taxable income and a decrease in excess tax benefits. The net result is an adjusted net income of $109 million or
$1.21 per share, down from $1.25 per share in the prior quarter.
Now, let me provide an update on our progress related to our strategic initiatives announced in Q4 of last year. As
you can see on slide 9, we remain on track to deliver an 8% to 10% reduction in core non-interest expense and
expect this to be fully realized on a run rate basis in Q4. Highlights of the initiatives include the consolidation of 26
banking centers, organizational actions to streamline execution and delivery for our customers, optimization of
corporate real estate and, in June, we launched our new digital account opening experience for consumers.
Turning to slide 10. I'll review the results of our second quarter allowance for loan loss under CECL. In the
quarter, we reported $21.5 million benefit to provision and a $20 million reduction in the allowance. The allowance
coverage ratio excluding PPP loans declined from 1.64% to 1.49% with total reserves of $308 million. As we look
at the trend from Q1 to Q2, we built $10 million in reserves related to commercial and residential loan growth
which was more than offset by a $31 million reduction due to improved credit quality and the macroeconomic
trends. Credit quality improvements include a net recovery recorded in the quarter and downward trends in non-
performing loans and commercial classifieds. In addition, our macroeconomic forecast reflects improving trends in
unemployment, GDP and housing prices.
Slide 11 highlights our key asset quality metrics which continue to improve. Non-performing loans in the upper left
decreased $30 million from Q1. Commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage and consumer each
saw linked quarter declines. Net charge-offs in the upper right reflected $1.2 million in net recoveries, largely
driven by consumer from the strong housing market. Commercial classified loans in the lower left decreased $102
million from Q1 and represented 262 basis points of total commercial loans. Improvement was driven by credit
upgrades and pay downs within the sponsoring specialty and middle market businesses.
On slide 12, we provide detail on payment deferrals related to the pandemic which have declined across the
board, down $121 million or 48% linked quarter and $182 million or 58% from year end. At June 30, total deferrals
represented 0.6% of total loans.
Slide 13 highlights our strong capital levels, regulatory capital ratios exceeded well capital levels by substantial
amounts. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.65% exceeds well capitalized by more than $1.2 billion. Likewise,
Tier 1 risk-based capital of 12.28% exceeds well capitalized levels by $980 million.
With respect to the third quarter, we expect average core loan growth which excludes PPP to be approximately
2.5% subject to individual loan funding and payoff activity. We expect PPP loan forgiveness of approximately
$300 million. Net interest income will be relatively flat while net interest margin will be driven by the level of
excess liquidity and the rate environment.
We expect noninterest income to be in the range of Q2 levels. On expenses, we expect to continue make
progress on our Q4 goal of 8% to 10% core cost reduction. And the tax rate will be between 22% and 23%.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for closing remarks.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks a lot, Glenn. We remain committed to delivering for our bankers, our customers, our communities, and of
course our shareholders consistent with our overarching objectives of maximizing economic profits over time and
creating long-term franchise value. I want to take a minute to thank each of our bankers for their dedication,
perseverance, and hard work.
Our bankers have met the challenges of a pandemic, a yearlong comprehensive organizational and strategic
transformation program, and the announcement of an integration work associated with a game-changing merger.
We expected a lot from our team, and as our values-based bankers always do, they delivered with
professionalism, competence and enthusiasm. Their commitment has enabled us to continue to deliver for all of
our stakeholders.
With that, Melissa, Glenn, and I are prepared to take your questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with
Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.

Hey, Matt. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good. First question. Maybe, could you talk a little bit about the asset sensitivity of the combined institution? And I
really want to get a sense for how much of the combined portfolio will be subject – is floating rates and subject to
floors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So, Matt, good morning. It's Glenn. So, if you look at the combined organization, we're very similar from an
asset sensitivity standpoint, and you can see back on – in the back in the Appendix, our asset sensitivity to rise in
50 basis points. If I look at it, and I look at the floating and periodic basis, so, total loans, say, $41 billion, of that, I
would say about $26 billion is floating and periodic. Now, there are some of those that have loans or floors, so you
probably back out about $4 billion, $4.5 billion of floors. And so, that remaining piece once you back that out,
that's really what would be subject to the first 50 basis point move, say, in rates and that's where you would
expect to get the asset sensitivity.

I think the wildcard here is on deposit betas. And so, there has been – the historical betas have been around
32%. I think that has come down. It has come down significantly. If you look at our asset sensitivity, we're showing
a 6% increase in PPNR. If we get the first 50 basis point move in rates and a lot of that's driven by our reduction
in deposit betas and so you see that has come down to like from 34% to 28%. So, I think that's going to be the
wildcard as we begin to see rates rise. I think there'll be a lag and it could be anywhere from zero to 15% to be
honest with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Okay. Next one for me, just on HSA third-party accounts, the TPA accounts are rolling off slower than
expected. I'm sorry if I missed it, but what's the remaining account balance that should roll off there and what's the
new projection for when that transition is complete?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think the remaining account balance and I just say we had that back on the slides, if you look in the Appendix,
$276 million in balances. And I think the account balance is 246,000 accounts. So, if you go back, Matt, you look
on our deck, you'll see that on page 16 where we spiked out the TPA balances and the accounts. So, as John
mentioned, there was about $120 million that moved out in the quarter and that was about 38,000 accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And, Matt, just to remind you, we talked about that it seems like 10 years ago, but it was third quarter of 2019
based on the transaction, the WageWorks transaction, with HealthEquity and another one of our sort of custodian
accounts getting their own deposit charter. And so, we really don't have control of the timing of the departure. And
we also get exit fees during the quarter they leave. So, at least in the short term, there's not a big economic
impact. Over the long term, obviously, we'll replace those with accounts that are core to us that are more
profitable ultimately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then last one for me, I just noticed that in fee income, other free income was down quite a bit quarter-
over-quarter, came in about $8.4 million versus $12.4 million last quarter. What was the driver of the of the
decrease there? And anything onetime that you would point out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, a big driver of that was a valuation on our customer derivative book and that was driven by a lower
forward curve on LIBOR. So, what happens there is that the customer swap assets increase and so the credit
portion of that also increases. Now, that's a valuation adjustment. I will point out that they are all cross
collateralized. So, it's not necessarily a risk and it's more of a function of the rate environment. You'll see some
volatility in that particularly as rates have jumped around so much quarter-over-quarter.

And, Matt, that's a good question because our core kind of operating non-interest income fees were kind of flat in
general and we had slight increase in our retail deposit fees, slightly lower swap and syndication fees. But that
valuation adjustment is really what caused the delta between last quarter and this.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities.
Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I wanted to touch on loan growth. It was great to see the
rebound here in the second quarter. And I was curious about how much of it is a function of increased loan
demand from the borrowers versus you guys kind of pushing the envelope and being a bit more aggressive given
how difficult the loan growth environment is for the banking industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
David, I have a wiseass answer to that question but I won't do it. Well, obviously we're not pushing the envelope
on structure or price too much. I will say the pricing environment is really competitive, talking to our head of
commercial banking. The structures haven't moved really far away which is good. But all good transactions
particularly in areas like commercial real estate, asset-based lending and others are extremely competitive from a
price perspective. This quarter, we're really pleased with the loan growth. And as I've said probably a million times
on these quarterly calls, one quarter does not make a year and it depends on what happens with respect to pay
offs and pay downs, originations. But I will say that I'm proud that our commercial bank over the last seven or
eight years has just posted 10% organic loan growth on an annualized basis year in and year out.
So, in this quarter in particular as I mentioned, kind of traditional middle market which was a really good sign, that
includes our public sector finance and our geographic middle market offices, did really well and had strong
originations. Our sponsor and specialty businesses in select verticals like healthcare, healthcare technology and
technology in and of itself, continue to have significant demand and did, quite frankly, throughout the pandemic
which obviously helped us continue to grow loans.
So, as I've said many times, we have tons of levers to pull across our geographical regions, asset-based lending,
equipment finance, our specialty verticals, commercial real estate, business banking. And this quarter, we just
happened to see really nice originations that fit our RAROC model. They have good risk-adjusted returns. They fit
our credit model. And we remain confident that over the long term, we can keep generating loan growth at the top
of the market rates.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And it sounds like the pipelines are pretty strong. Can you comment on where pipelines are today versus, say, a
quarter ago? And, well, clearly a year ago, the pipelines were pretty bad. But can you talk about pipelines today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I will say that our stated pipeline is stronger than it was
last quarter and stronger than it was a year ago. Again, I'm always hesitant because it seems like in our
businesses, particularly the transactional ones, prepayments can drive ultimate growth. But from an origination
perspective across all of our key businesses, pipelines are up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And then, lastly on utilization rates on revolving lines. Can you discuss where the utilization rate is today versus a
quarter ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I will. It's stable. And I think this is the first quarter-to-quarter period where we've seen significant
stabilization and maybe even a tick-up. But I'm not going to declare victory there. Utilization rates are still below
pre-pandemic rates. I think that has to do with so much liquidity in the system, as well as supply chain imbalances
and people's inability to maybe build inventory in certain sectors. So, if I look at ABL or across our traditional
committed revolvers in commercial, I would say, we've seen stabilization to a slight tick-up in utilization. But still a
good 5% to 10% on average below pre-pandemic levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's great. That's impressive that you had such good growth with stable utilization rates. So, that'll be a nice
tailwind going forward. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks very much.

Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Kind of a question I asked on Sterling call this morning was they sold some loans that were deemed higher risk
into the close, is there anything – given the liquidity in the market is pretty high. Is there anything on your balance
sheet that might be kind of right for pruning before you consummate the merger?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I would say no. Strategically there's nothing really in our book that we think we would want to sell right now. We
have sold off non-performing consumer loans at times where we thought the economics were right and we didn't
have to carry them obviously because they're a drag and a longer term workout. But there are no pockets, Chris,
in our balance sheet right now that we're eyeing loan sales in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I'd note, interestingly, because I wanted to get this in that I believe this was our first net recovery quarter since
before the Great Recession, which is pretty remarkable considering we just came out of a pandemic. And it goes
to show how much liquidity is in the system and what government stimulus has done. But we were even surprised
by that outcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's a great development. On the merger call, you were I think pretty confident about just the pro forma
growth opportunities of the company. This quarter would certainly give credit that. Is it right to assume that today
versus 90 days ago that you're feeling better about I guess both near-term and intermediate term loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'm feeling as confident, let's say, as confident, Chris. I'm not sure – I think our view always was and you
heard us talk jointly on that call, our expectations of loan growth for 2021 individually and on a combined basis
kind of in that 4% to 5%. And we talked about the fact that the second half of this year could be still muffled loan
growth because of how much liquidity was in the system. Obviously, we reported higher loan growth as did a
couple of our peers. And as we head into 2022 and 2023, we've talked about 8% to 9%, 8% to 10% growth
overall. And I still feel pretty confident given what's going on in the economy, absent some kind of real change
with the Delta virus. I think this quarter certainly gave us additional confidence in our ability as we move forward to
hit those numbers in 2022 and 2023 on a combined basis.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Okay. That's great color. I just wanted to make sure I understand the guidance real quickly for the quarter. The
net interest income stability comment, is that GAAP or is that excluding the PPP?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No, that's GAAP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, $220.9 million to – about the same range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And what – I missed the PPP. What was the – in the quarter, the contribution and what's left?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, PPP for the quarter contributed to net interest income about $13.5 million which is down from $18 million in
prior quarter. And we have $31 million in remaining fees. And I would say if you look over to the next three
quarters, it's about a third, a third, a third that we are expecting from a forgiveness standpoint. So, about $10
million a quarter in the next three quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then lastly, the expenses and fees – the expenses, the pace came down quicker than I thought. Is this the
kind of the range that the fully optimized like $167 million, $168 million that the 8% to 10% implies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No. As we showed on the slide, I mean our objective – and we feel very confident is to get down to that $164
million on a core expense run rate. And so, there's more that will come along off of the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And the fees were adjusting for the mark-to-market or not? I'm just trying to make sure I get that right for
the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
The fees – I'm not sure I understand the question.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I think – wasn't your comment stable fee income kind of going forward in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, stable fee income. And that's – so I'm assuming that the forward curve in the case of credit
valuations stay about stable.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed
with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe for those of us that are a little bit less familiar with Sterling,
bigger picture, I think we've all got a good sense of where your balance sheet is kind of headed here. But is there
anything you would call out in terms of Sterling dynamics that in terms of run-off in certain areas that might help
us kind of dimension the growth rate of the combined?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Brock, first, it's good to hear from you and thanks for the question. I would say, no, strategically right now and the
work that we have done since after diligence, since announcement has just confirmed is that I think all of the
business lines that Sterling operates in right now and the verticals are things that we will continue to look to grow.
Over the long-term, I think, our management framework and me and Jack and Luis and Glenn will continue to
look at risk adjusted returns. We'll look at opportunities in the marketplace. We'll look at pricing and competitive
dynamics. We'll look at our position in the league tables and whether or not we can matter in certain asset classes
or verticals.
But right now we're going in with probably over 20 different geographies and verticals and industries, all of which
we think are appropriate from a credit risk perspective, all of which we think we can grow. And as you've heard
me say, oftentimes, having more levers than fewer levers is really helpful because you don't have to press on

credit quality, you don't have to press on price in any one vertical that may not be as attractive during a period of
time.
So, I would say when you put these two banks together at least pro forma initially, we'll be executing in all of the
verticals and geographies that are aggregated between the two banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I think we've got a good sense of the loan trends. On the funding side in terms of deposits,
anything you would highlight in terms of trends, average to end of period? Is liquidity wave here in the process of
breaking or how would you characterize that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
We haven't seen it break yet. So, average consumer balances, average commercial balances, municipal balances
which, by the way, haven't even seen the peak of their tax collection season, they're all significantly above
average long-term and medium-term average trends. So, our expectation is that we'll still be dealing with this for
another couple of quarters before we see kind of fulsome economic activity, and people start to draw down on
their liquidity both individuals and businesses as they move towards more purchasing activity and more
investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with
your question.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler on for Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Maybe just following up on that last question. So, the loan growth you saw this quarter, are the
borrowers maintaining higher levels of liquidity on your balance sheet and then borrowing in addition to that, or
are these borrowers that maybe don't have as significant a balance of deposits on your balance sheet? And I
guess just as you're thinking about the excess liquidity out there, both on your balance sheet and the borrowers'
14

balance sheet, to what extent is that 8% to 10% longer-term loan growth guide a matter of borrowers first working
through their own liquidity before really getting into the borrowing base at a more normalized level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question, Jared (sic) [Timur], and I'm not sure I can give you a really detailed response. Most
of the growth or origination for instance in commercial real estate and sponsor and specialty, you don't really see
that dynamic because you've got deal transactions that are mostly I'm going to use the little L leveraged, not
regulatory leveraged, but they're not dealing with lots of liquidity. They're using debt to acquire companies. And
so, there's not that immediate offset when they borrow their cash or their cash comes out or they're borrowing in
lieu of deploying their cash, I think it's more strategic deployment of debt capital.
That does happen in some of our business banking and commercial cases where you're seeing them have lower
utilization, higher cash balances and then as you see them start to draw down on their lines of credit, you'll start to
see kind of the dynamic interplay. When they get lower balances, they'll draw higher on their capital. But I don't
think – what we've said all along is our hypothesis exactly what you just said, which is there's going to be a period
of time where loan growth demand will not return to its fulsome self until you start to see some of the companies
and borrowers draw down on their liquidity. But I don't – I wouldn't say this quarter we saw kind of an offsetting
activities in deposit account balances and draw downs on lines or the deployment of term loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. And then maybe looking at the Sterling integration and how that process is moving
along, as you're getting deeper into the integration process and closer to closing the transaction, I guess how are
you feeling about the cost saves opportunity? I think you had broken it down based on technology, back office
and kind of corporate facilities in the past.
Is that, A, seems still realistic? B, is there potential to upsize that? And, C, I guess again maybe going back to an
earlier question, is there an opportunity to maybe do something on the balance sheet in advance of the deal
whether it's on the liquidity side or whether it's getting deeper into products prior to a deal close?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would say, answering your latter question first, I wouldn't comment on any kind of activity, balance sheet
activity or product moves between now and close. And I would stick with our initial guidance in terms of expense. I
think both Jack and I mentioned that over the long term, I think we both think that there are continued
opportunities to leverage the like functions and to continue to get more efficient.
But I can tell you the integration is going well and kind of the budgets that we're handing out for people to hit are
right in line with what we talked to the market about on April 19. And I think that's the appropriate level of
efficiency and the appropriate cost saves to be going into this combination together. And remember that that cost
save amount that we talked about is a net amount which does give us some investment flexibility as we put the
two banks together.

Okay. And then just last question from me, a modeling question. The $18.2 million of the strategic initiative and
merger-related adjustments, can you just provide the line items [indiscernible] (00:41:11)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, it's primarily in professional fees. Timur, it's Glenn. That is all primarily in professional fees. I think the piece
that's relative to the initiative is more spread out in other and lease, the lease line, but it's smaller amounts. So,
the biggest part of that $18 million is in professional fees.
