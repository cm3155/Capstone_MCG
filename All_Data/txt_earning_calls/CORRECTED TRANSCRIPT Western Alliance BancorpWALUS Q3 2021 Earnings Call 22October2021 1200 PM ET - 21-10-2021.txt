Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Also joining us here today is Tim Bruckner, our Chief Credit
Officer. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the unique benefits of Western Alliance's national
commercial business strategy to position WAL as one of the country's premier growth commercial banks that
consistently generates leading balance sheet and earnings growth with superior asset quality across economic
cycles.
As a company, we are proud of our thoughtful, safe, sustainable growth, and are excited to have passed the $50
billion asset milestone. Validating our strategy during the quarter, we raised $300 million in an inaugural preferred
offering, achieving the lowest ever preferred dividend rate for a US bank under $100 billion in assets at 4.25%. In
the third quarter, exceptional balance sheet expansion continued with our highest ever quarterly loan growth of
$4.8 billion or 63% on a linked quarter annualized basis. And deposits rose by $3.4 billion or 32% annualized, as
we continue to effectively deploy liquidity.
Loan demand continue to broaden across our business lines, with C&I loans increasing by $2.2 billion, inclusive
of $240 million of PPP runoff along with $2.3 billion of growth in our residential portfolio. Notably, capital call lines
drove $1.9 billion of growth within C&I, as deal activity continues to be strong and utilization rates rose.
Additionally, resort lending and hotel franchise finance contributed approximately $140 million of loan growth, as
well as $148 million increase in CRE investor.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
For the third quarter, WAL generated record total net revenues of $548.5 million, a 57% annualized rise in PPNR
to $317.1 million and adjusted EPS of $2.30. Adjusted EPS quarter-to-quarter rose by $0.01 as the company
recorded a provision for credit losses totaling $12.3 million, an increase of $26.8 million from the $14.5 million
provision released in the second quarter.
We remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry, with return on average assets and return on average
tangible common equity of 1.83% and 26.6% respectively, which will continue to support capital accumulation and
strong capital levels in the quarters to come.
I would like to reiterate that AmeriHome is now integrated into the strategic fabric of Western Alliance and is
thoughtfully managed to maximize value for the entire bank through loan, deposits, and net interest income
growth. A $5.2 billion increase in average earning assets drove net interest income growth of $39.9 million or
10.8% for the quarter or 43% annualized to $410.4 million, as excess liquidity deployment into loans and loans
held for sale contributed significantly to earnings.
Fee income increased $2.1 million to $138.1 million and now represents over 25% of total net revenue. Asset
quality continues to remain stable, as total nonperforming assets declined to $10 million to 17 basis points of total
assets, and net charge-offs were $3 million or 4 basis points.
Finally, what excites me most is the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us. We will continue to do what
we do best and support our clients in attractive markets nationally where they do business. I believe we have
exited the pandemic as an employer of choice for leading specialized commercial lenders, which positions us well
or extremely well to attract and retain uniquely qualified talent to thoughtfully sustain growth with superior risk-
adjusted returns.
For example, during the quarter we hired two seasoned teams. We added 11 people based in Texas to our
single-family home construction CRE national business line and brought on the leading national restaurant
franchise finance team with the hire of six loan and credit professionals. Both teams join us from larger
commercial banks where they proved their business plans and built robust multi-billion-dollar books of business.
The Texas CRE team has $10 million in outstandings and an additional $110 million approved to be funded and a
$400 million pipeline. Likewise, the restaurant franchise finance team has $90 million in outstandings and $54
million approved to be funded, and a pipeline of $300 million.
Dale will now take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated record net revenue of $548.5 million, up 8.3%
quarter-over-quarter or 33% annualized. Net interest income grew $39.9 million during the quarter to $410.4
million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and
deployment of liquidity into higher-yielding assets. PPNR rose 57% on an annualized linked quarter basis to
$317.1 million excluding acquisition and restructuring expenses.
Non-interest income increased $2.1 million to $138 million from the prior quarter as mortgage banking related
income rose $12 million for the quarter and totaled $123.2 million. Servicing revenue increased $23 million in the
quarter as refinance activity slowed despite a smaller servicing portfolio of $47.2 billion in unpaid principal

balance. Gain on sale margin was 51 basis points for the quarter, as we extended the time from funding to sale,
which positively impacted net interest income.
With these evolving mortgage sector fundamentals, AmeriHome continues to meet our pro forma acquisition
expectations, contributing $0.58 during the quarter, which is inclusive of $0.20 in net interest income from
AmeriHome using our balance sheet, an opportunity most stand-alone correspondent lenders don't have.
Finally, adjusted net income for the quarter was $238.8 million or $2.30 in adjusted EPS, which is inclusive of a
credit loss provision of $12.3 million, but excludes pre-tax margin restructuring charges of $2.4 million.
Turning to net interest drivers, during the quarter, deployment of our excess liquidity into higher-yielding assets
drove both loan growth and net interest income growth. Loans held for sale increased $2.1 billion and are yielding
3.35%. On a linked-quarter basis, yield on loans held for investment declined 20 basis points to 4.28%, which is
fully explained by the continued strong growth in low to no life asset categories, namely residential loans and
capital call lines.
Interest-bearing deposits remained relatively stable from the prior quarter at 21 basis points, as were total cost of
funds at 28 basis points. Consistent with our previous comments, we believe that in the current rate environment,
funding costs have stabilized.
Net interest income grew $39.9 million during the quarter to $410 million or 44% year-over-year, as balance sheet
growth and optimization of earning asset mix generated robust spread income. Average earning assets increased
$5.2 billion or 12% during the quarter to $48.4 billion. Additionally, we successfully deployed liquidity into loans
and have held the investment portfolio relatively flat in favor of loans held for sale, which we view as a higher
yielding cash-like alternative. Despite our successful liquidity deployment in Q3, we still have meaningful dry
powder of $1 billion in cash and the opportunity to further fund loans through continued deposit growth.
As a result of loan growth in lower-yielding categories, NIM declined 8 basis points to 3.43%. We expect
continued strong net interest income growth as we're well-positioned to take advantage of a rising rate
environment as 71% of our commercial loan portfolio is variable rate and we have 47% noninterest-bearing
deposit funding.
Our efficiency ratio improved to 41.5% from 44.5% during the quarter, while we continue to make investments to
support risk management and sustained growth. The inherent operating efficiency of deploying excess liquidity
has helped push our efficiency ratio to the lower 40s.
Pre-provision net revenue increased $39.7 million or 14% from the prior quarter and 75% from the same period
last year. This resulted in a PPNR ROA of 2.45% for the quarter, an increase of 14 basis points compared to
2.31% from the last quarter. This continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides us
significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, support infrastructure and other capital management
actions as well as meet credit demands.
Balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $4.8 billion or 15.9% to $34.8 billion.
Strong deposit growth of $3.4 billion brought balances to $45.3 billion at quarter-end. In all, total assets have
grown 58% year-over-year to $52.8 billion.
Total deposits increased $313 million over the prior quarter to $2.1 billion, primarily due to overnight borrowings of
$400 million, partially offset by the redemption of $75 million in subordinated debt. As Tim described, we

experienced record quarterly loan growth this quarter with growth evenly split between residential and C&I loans.
In all, loans grew $4.8 billion during the quarter and were up $5 billion ex-PPP run-off and over 34% year-over-
year. Residential real estate and C&I loans grew $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.
Turning to deposits, we continue to see broad-based core deposit growth across our business channels. Deposits
grew $3.4 billion or 8% in the third quarter with the strongest growth in savings and money market accounts of
$1.6 billion. Noninterest bearing DDA accounts contributed $950 million and represents 47% of total deposits.
Strong performance from commercial clients, robust fundraising activity in tech and innovation and seasonal
inflows in HOA banking relationships were all significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter.
We are confident in the stickiness of deposits that we've generated in recent quarters, particularly as our newer
initiatives are finally taking root. Our asset quality remained strong and stable. Special mention loans continue to
decline to $364 million or 105 basis points of funded loans. Total classified assets rose $26 million in the third
quarter, $265 million or 50 basis points in total assets, but are down more than 40% from a year ago on a ratio
basis. Total non-performing assets declined $10 million to 17 basis points of total assets.
Quarterly credit losses continue to be nominal. In the third quarter, net charge-offs were $3 million or 4 basis
points of average loans annualized compared to $100,000 in the second quarter. Our loan allowance for credit
losses increased $15 million from the prior quarter to $275 million due to robust loan growth. In all, total loan ACL
to funded loans is 80 basis points or 82 basis points when excluding PPP loans. As mentioned in prior quarters,
the strategic focus of the bank is to source a significant portion of loan growth from low to no loss segments to
achieve a diversified risk – a risk diversified portfolio. With the third quarter loan growth, our low- to no-loss
segments now comprise over half of total loans.
Given our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we generate sufficient capital to fund about 25% to 35%
annual loan growth, depending on the mix and this is after dividend service. Our tangible common equity to total
asset ratio of 6.9% and common equity Tier 1 of 8.7%, we're way down this quarter by robust asset growth in
excess of these levels.
As you've seen throughout the year, we took several capital actions to enhance our capital stat and support
ongoing growth. During Q3, we issued $300 million of preferred equity, which was slightly offset in total capital as
we redeemed $75 million of subordinated debt. We were also redeeming $175 million, of 6.25% subordinated
debt this quarter, which we anticipate to be complete in November. We will recognize a $6 million pre-tax non-
recurring charge associated with this redemption as we accelerate amortization of origination cost on net debt.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment which we increased to $0.35, our tangible book value per share
rose to $1.81 in the quarter to $34.67 or 19% growth in the past year. Our tangible book value per share growth is
industry-leading and have grown 2.5 times that of the peers over the past five years or at a compound annual rate
of over 19%.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken to conclude.

Thanks, Dale. The third quarter really was an exceptional quarter from an earnings and loan growth perspective
as our distinctive national business strategy model continues to hit on all cylinders. Impressively, end-of-period
loan balances were $3.3 billion greater than the average balance, which provides a strong jump-off point for the
fourth quarter, net interest income in addition to the $1 billion in excess liquidity that we are gradually deploying in

the coming quarters. We're very excited about the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us as we enter
the fourth quarter.
Looking forward for full-year 2022, you can expect loan held for investments to continue robust growth with a
quarterly minimum of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, an increase from the prior guidance of $1 billion to $1.5 billion or a
low to mid 20s percent growth rate for the year with flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest
income.
Today, approximately half of our growth was generated from low to no loss residential mortgages. Deposits are
expected to grow in line with loans as we work to deploy excess liquidity and normalize the loan-to-deposit ratio,
which today stands at 77%. We expect to maintain our efficiency ratio in the lower 40s as we continue to invest in
risk management and technology and work to bring new business lines, products and services to market.
Total revenue and PPNR growth will track balance sheet growth as we benefit from operational leverage.
Regarding capital, we are targeting a CET1 ratio of 9%, which our robust quarter-end loan growth impacted. We
have several mechanisms to address our capital levels. Most importantly, we generate significant capital through
earnings growth and have historically demonstrated our success in accessing the capital markets.
In conclusion, we continue to see strong pipelines and have the operating flexibility to both execute on near-term
opportunities, while investing for the long-term growth.
At this time, Dale, Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

I guess just, first, Ken, you talked about next year and the lower 40s efficiency ratio. I think the one thing that
investors wrestle with is just the sustainability of your ROA/ROE. Give us a sense of like; one, is this efficiency
ratio sustainable, especially given your asset size going over $50 billion today? And is there anything on the
mortgage side that we should worry about that could impact the profitability of the bank over the next year or two?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Okay. Thanks, Ebrahim. First, we think the efficiency ratio in the lower 40s is sustainable for the next couple of
years. We think our strong net interest income will overpower any expense growth that we have. What we're
doing as a company, I think it may be a little bit unique rather compared to our industry peers is not only are we
working on 2022's growth ,but right now, we're working on 2023's growth. And we need to keep the efficiency ratio
in the lower 40s, so we can bring in new teams, as I just discussed, launch new products and services to propel
us going forward.
Regarding AMH and if there's anything that worries us or can impact the growth, AMH has a number of levers
combined being inside of a commercial bank, as you heard Dale talk about, with net interest income growth. And
so, we are still confident about the 2022's EPS guidance that we had given when we did the acquisition, which is
now folded into our overall guidance as we talk about the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Ebrahim, I appreciate your comment on alluding to the $50 billion as being a hurdle that sometimes is, companies
with higher levels of risk management expenses. But as Ken indicated, we're – we've been leading this ahead for
years now. And so, we have already put in place much of that infrastructure that we need and expect that,
basically on risk management, you probably get this economies of scale as you grow. But yeah, but we're
prepared for that and that's embedded in our guidance on efficiency.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful, Dale. Thanks. Just because – I think the other side of low efficiency is concerns around
underinvestment, so I think that's helpful. And then, just separately on the loan growth, Ken, I think you mentioned
minimum of 1.5% to 2%. Paint us an upside scenario of what could lead that loan growth to being much stronger.
Obviously, you are a much larger bank today. I would imagine that a much more – many more opportunities than
you had even 12 months ago. So, give us a sense of whether you see more upside or downside risk to that loan
growth outlook and what could drive that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Thank you, Ebrahim. Let me just add to the last comment – the first comment you made that we are very
cognizant of underinvesting, so we're not looking to drive that efficiency ratio below 40%. We could if we wanted
to, but investing for the long-term and having long-term growth aspirations as we do, it's important that we keep
investing, which leads us right into your question about my confidence level. So, I feel very strong about growing
between $1.5 billion to $2 billion. If you kind of look backwards, you can see that our old guidance of $1 billion to
$1.5 billion, we easily passed that or succeeded that. But right now, as I look forward, we have strong demand for
subscription and capital call lines. There's demand in lot banking, hotel and residential construction. We believe
there'll be some new AmeriHome products that will bring online, jumbo loans, non-QM loans that will be able to
feed our balance sheet as well.
We see a great deal of activity in the CRE income-producing space, especially with distribution centers. We've
done a few spec centers. And before the show was even lifted, those spec centers have been already pre-leased.
So, we see strong demand there. And there are several new businesses that we hope to bring online, probably
towards the back end of 2022, which will give us confidence as we go through the year in 2022, looking forward to
2023 in terms of our growth momentum. So yeah, I guess the short answer is I'm feeling good.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I would also add – like to add that after a couple of quarters now, we've talked about having to right-size the loan-
to-deposit ratio. Obviously, if we're growing, $1.5 billion to $2 billion on each side of the balance sheet at the
same time, we're not going to move that number. We did – we made some progress this last quarter where we
took it to the higher 70s from the low 70s. But we used to be at 95. So, I expect as we go through this period and
this may largely happen in the residential space, but we would have some outsized quarters where loan growth is
going to continue either way at that low loan to deposit deployment rate.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And I just want to add one comment to my statement, which is I want to make sure everyone on the line knows
that we're not chasing loan growth, right? So, 51% of our portfolio today is either in low-loss or no-loss credit
segments. So, we've been growing and growing in less riskier assets as we've been posting these numbers.

Another loan growth question for you. So, this loan growth guide does feel pretty conservative, especially with all
the runway you have on the resi mortgage side. This time next year, you guys – I think you guys have talked
about getting resi loans to about 30% of the loan book. Is that still kind of your limit? And then, once you get there,
is $1.5 billion to $2 billion a quarter still sustainable? And is that – especially with all these new businesses that
you're looking to add on at the end of 2022?

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Casey, for your question. And thanks for the very eloquent way you called me a sandbagger. I appreciate
that. First, if I wasn't clear, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion is our minimum loan growth numbers. We actually said that
we think we're going to post mid-25% growth year-over-year. And that would raise that number a little bit higher. It
may come in a little uneven, but we think we'll get to the mid-25% range. And to the 30% number, we can get
there as quickly as we want. We would prefer to see it more coming in on the commercial side. But we have a
very balanced and restrained viewpoint at this moment on the mortgage side, but we can turn that on.
Note that I said that AMH is turning on – just turned on their non-QM and jumbo loan product, and that's going to
take a little time to ramp up as we get AMH's clients comfortable with the program, understanding our credit box
and our process. But that thing should hit full stride somewhere in the middle of next year, and that will allow us to
step on the accelerator, if we want, and put on more loan growth. Really, loan growth will be dictated somewhat
by deposit growth, as Dale said. We've got plenty of deposit liquidity sitting on our balance sheet with a 76% loan-
to-deposit ratio, and also our guide is that we expect deposits to grow along with loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I don't think there's a stop sign at a 31% concentration level of residential. I mean, I think we – that's where
we would approach the median of the peers, and we would – we reflect always in terms of what our proportion
should be. But I could see that number being higher. As you know, there are some other institutions that are
higher than that that seem to be well regarded by the Street.
And as we get there, I think we're going to have kind of other opportunities and as well as to manage our interest
rate risk profile, where some institutions have maybe gotten into trouble was too high of a residential
concentration as they don't have a funding mix that matches that. But with nearly half of our funding in DDA, it
gives us more tolerance for an interest rate risk environment to have something with a longer-dated – longer
maturity on the asset side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. Dale, a question for you on the mortgage servicing lines within fees and expenses, a positive
swing to the tune of about $30 million. Looking forward, is there a way that you can kind of give us a better feel for
this as we get used to this business, because – or should we just kind of expect – should expect this volatility to
continue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, honestly, for us, I will look at it more on a total revenue from AmeriHome rather than looking at those two
lines separately. There is a little bit of an interchange between them. If you have a more robust view in terms of
what valuations of mortgage servicing rights are, you're going to have a mortgage servicing right mark that is –
that could be maybe potentially higher and that gives you more gain on sale. But, ultimately – and we're regularly
selling these down, we have a ready price point to confirm the veracity and the accuracy of that number and by
seeing what the gain is in terms of the disposition. So, one feeds the other and they run off of each other in a fairly
short window on our balance sheet and income statement unlike some others.

Okay. Very good. And just lastly on the capital management front. Ken, I'm sorry. I missed your comments at the
end there. But you guys are below your kind of 9% level. You did not use the ATM. Is the thinking that on a more
moderate pace of growth that you'll – and a 25% plus ROE that you'll just rebuild organically to get above 9%, or

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, there are a couple of things there. I think this is a high-class problem to have that our growth is coming in.
So, yeah, we will go to the market for growth capital. We could do that either through the ATM or we have some
other CRT trades that we're working on and hopefully we'll line them up before the end of the fourth quarter. Our
goal is to be just above 9% on a CET1 ratio. I think once we get there and if our growth is sort of programmed the
way we just described it, we won't need to go back many more times to hit the market. But if it comes in at an
accelerated pace, as I said, high-quality problem to have, we're happy to issue growth capital to support these
earnings.

Hey, Brad.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, curious if you could comment on just kind of where new loan yields are coming on kind of relative to the
book yield. I don't think you included spot yields in the slide deck this quarter, so we're just kind of curious kind of
where the new loans versus the old were coming on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini A
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yeah. New loan yields are pretty much on top of slightly lower than what we're running off. The reason why we
had a 20 bps decline, and I think I alluded to this but I'll give you a little bit more color, is because of the mix

change. We put on north of $2 billion of residential. Those yields are about $3 billion. We put on just short of $2
billion worth of basically capital call lines. Those yields are pushing $3 billion, $2.5 billion to $3 billion. So, if we
had the both of those in, that probably explains the 20 basis point kind of clip there.
Now, that said, I mean, I think residential is going to be a continued part of our growth trajectory. And so, will we
have an additional kind of a slippage in total loan yields in the fourth quarter from the third? Yeah, I believe we
will. But it's not really the spot rates as much as the mix of the loan portfolio that's going to drive that a little bit
lower. But again, we're prepared for that. And as we did this quarter as well, we expect to just kind of plow
through that in terms of net interest income performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. That's helpful. And as you guys have reshaped the loan portfolio and will continue to reshape it with more
resi, how do I think about sort of asset betas if the Fed were to in fact start raising rates at some point in the
future? I know you had the loan floor number in the 10-Q, but just kind of curious how you guys are sort of levered
to still the short end. Obviously, a lot of DDA, but just kind of curious the impact this time around versus last time
around since you do have more fixed rate product on the books.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't know how many we're going to get. But I'll say for the first couple of rate increases, you're
not going to see much change. We do have a number of loans at floors, and so those won't change. Some of the
floor and the variable rate are the same number. That's a pretty common situation for recent origination activity.
So those could see an immediate increase, but that's the smaller proportion in terms of the loan book.
So, within a range of two to three kind of rate revisions, I don't think we're going to see much on the asset yield
improvement, nor are we going to see much in terms of funding costs. Two reasons on the funding costs, one is
we've got a very heavy proportion of DDA today and two is, I just see a lot of liquidity in the system and I see
banks kind of struggling to deploy that. I don't think you're going to get betas at least out of the gate for the
industry as high as they've been in other rate rising environments, because there's just no incentive to increase
your funding costs when you're opportunities for deployment remain limited.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And final question for me. You mentioned your decision the hold more – the mortgage loans on the books
this quarter. Obviously, that helped the average held for sale balance. Is it your intent to continue to do that?
Obviously, market conditions will drive that. But have you just kind of scratched the surface on kind of where you
think that number can go in terms of adding new products at AMH, et cetera? Just wanted to get a sense of that
average balance going forward of loans held for sale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I – this is Ken. I think the average balance is going to rise. It's going to rise as you see deposit growth
continue. We had a $7.3 billion average balance for Q3 for the held-for-sale versus an ending loan balance of
$6.8 billion. We see this as an attractive way to generate incremental net interest income. These loans earned
3.35%. That was up 24 basis points from the prior quarter. And think of these mortgages or think of – think of this

– the held-for-sale as a big money market account that has a three-week turn to it or a three-week maturity that is
government protected. So, we – I mean, this is great. We love it.
And this is one of the reasons and as we both, Dale and I, alluded to in our comments that these are the benefits
that we get with AMH that stand-alone mortgage providers would not get. And that's why, we are very excited
about doing the acquisition because of all the deposit and loan growth net interest income opportunities that AMH
offered to us. So, this is just an example of leveraging AMH's loan production onto WAL's balance sheet. And at
the end of the day, better than investing in 10 basis points after Fed. That's what we thought – that's what was
taught to us at [ph] P.S. 169 (00:35:23).

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I understand the comments about looking in AmeriHome
terms of total revenue basis in terms of the contribution, but for the mortgage geeks in the room, if you could just
kind of talk about the math on the gain on sale, how that may fluctuate. You alluded to holding the loans longer,
possibly depressing the gain on sale. Also, just talk about general gain on sale pressure or not that you're seeing
in the in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, there is a gain on sale pressure on the margin. If you go back to our comments when we acquired
AmeriHome, we always kind of planned for more of a 2018 gain on sale margin scenario. We hoped we'd be
wrong, but it's moving towards that direction. So, what we have in terms of the opportunities in front of us is to
increase our win share, our win rate, which was about 9% – 8.9% this quarter. So that's one way to maintain the
gain on sale dollar amount. Again, the other thing is we're not a slave to the gain on sale income. So, we can
participate or not at our choice, somewhat by how much money we're bringing in on these mortgages and other
opportunities that AMH is generating for us. So, in our big pro forma, when we looked at it, we assume that we're
going to get income from the new deposit growth, income for held for sale, income for held for investment

mortgages we put on our balance sheet. We assume that we were going to lower their cost of funds. We were –
we assumed that we could go out and cross-sell against their 840 client base and sell warehouse lending
financing or MSR financing. So, all that was sort of embedded in the big picture in terms of when we did the
transaction. So, we have a number of levers to pull if the margin continues to compress without it jeopardizing our
pro formas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And you've already started a couple of these. So – and we talked about this, I think, last time as well. But so
before we acquired AmeriHome, they were just in the government products, so GSE or direct obligations of the
federal government and they have now already rolled out their jumbo product, that's a new sandbox for them that
is also going to give them some [ph] GOS (00:38:33) revenue, as well as nonqualified mortgages as well. So,
we're expanding the – their playing field with what they're doing. We're expanding the penetration that they're
getting in this group for the 9% number as Ken mentioned to something higher moving up from there. And then,
we have a number of other elements like held for sale loans to again, address the performance and to soften any
volatility in the mortgage market, because they can kind of rely on us for liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And just to clarify that, Dale, if you had sold straight away, would that have resulted in a higher gain on sale that
by holding, you're just choosing to recognize an NII or some other place?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, I don't think it would result in a higher [ph] GOS (00:39:21) if we had sold immediately. What it would have
resulted in is less interest income. So, I mentioned – we said they had $0.58 contribution. Well, $0.20 of that is
basically them using our balance sheet and liquidity to use this held for sale line and hold. If you strip that away –
and a number of banks that are solely in this space that aren't owned by a banking company don't really have net
interest income, that's really not a meaningful component of their revenue sources – then their EPS is $0.38.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Right, which represents about 16% of our overall earnings. And just for the mortgage geeks out there, as you
said, I just want to emphasize that while AMH is a notable piece of our income stream, there are other regional
and national business lines that produce equal to or greater on the same number. So, for tech and innovation,
tech and innovation produces more than AmeriHome. But we tend to spend time talking about a business that has
a 6 multiple handle to it when I'd much rather talk about tech and innovation and the 29 multiple that we have –
that they get on tech and innovation income.
So, using this as a platform, Brock, to once again tell everyone, we are moving away from giving any AMH
numbers going forward as it relates to EPS. It's just embedded into our numbers as we move forward, and we're
just going to talk about the whole company at the top of the house.

Good morning.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I appreciated the details and commentary on the recent hire that you made and their production volumes so far.
But wanted to know if you could provide any more insight into your hiring strategy and your plans going forward,
especially in this environment a lot of other banks say that it's tough to find talent these days and they're
competing on compensation and whatnot, but just wanted to get more color on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Great question. And I do think the ability to hire is one of the longest poles in the tent to our strategic plan
of objectives. So, we are finding it a little more difficult to hire. Just yesterday on our town hall, I announced a
number of changes, which we think are very positive relative to both compensation, benefits, and flex work
schedules. We think that's going to help us bring in the people that we need. We have, in certain cases, for the
administrators, loan closers, those types of folks offered hiring bonuses that seemed to have worked and bring
people in. So that's good.
So, I think we are feeling a little bit of the pinch as some of the other companies are. As it relates to opportunities
to bring new teams in, though, we have more people contacting us about coming over to Western Alliance. I think
our size of the bank now helps. Our profile helps. Of course, the numbers that we posted help. And it's also a very
good way when we sit down across the table from a team or several people that we like to bring in and we say,
the stock did double this year. And the equity portion of what they get also is very attractive. So we're trying to
work all the angles here in terms of bringing in people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then touching on credit, so the reserve on a percentage basis declined in the quarter, but there
was a provision obviously because of the higher balance sheet growth, and now it's growing at a lower loss loan
categories, where do you see that loan loss reserve ratio shaking you out at?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
It's really hard to say, because we're in the CECL environment, currently expected credit losses, well, gosh, I
mean, one of the things that was powerful in our ratio declining so quickly is the expectations for collateral value
reductions, particularly in commercial properties abated dramatically. And so right out of the gate in the pandemic,
everyone thought there was going to be kind of a collateral value collapse. No one was ever going to go to the
office again. And so those estimates by Blue Chip and Moody's and others were fairly dramatic in terms of a
swoon. That didn't happen. And now that it has basically been abated, and so here we are with low expectations
of collateral value decline. And so the number looks pretty good.
Should something result in a change in that environment that would kind of reset that view, I think it could. And
that could put us in a higher expectation of potential risk. That said, in the today's current environment where
things are going, it's a little bit like, I don't know, an asymptote in terms of kind of coming down. We're
approaching a limit. I don't know exactly where that is, but I would expect that over the coming quarters, you'll see
maybe a bleed off of basis points in terms of coverage, but provisioning at a slowing rate. And how much lower it
goes, I don't know. I mean, you could come up with a lot lower number. I mean, if you say that you look at our
most recent performance on charge-offs, we're at 4 basis points this quarter annualized. That's about where we
are for the past year as well. And we have a duration of our loan book of four years.
So if I say I need 4 basis points a year and I've got a cover of four years average life, well, I only need 16 or call it
20 basis points, we've got 80. So in that sense, it looks like there's a lot of room to run down further. But I certainly
wouldn't count on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. And we have a little bit of a rate volume thing going on here, the volume being dollars. We will continue –
we anticipate continuing to add to the provision, but the rate side, you will see decline a little bit. So that's what
we're balancing here.

Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just maybe just two more on the build-
out or I guess the hire in the franchise finance business. I think that the London category has been relatively flat
since it was acquired a couple of years ago. I guess what's the outlook for that business going forward? Is it just a
bigger balance sheet that is giving you comfort in growing that? And I guess how big would you like to see that
business get with the new hire in place?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, no, thank you for the question. Well, first let me say that the team that we brought over has as its roots GE
credit granting experience. And they have the same roots that we have in our hotel franchise finance group as
well. So that's one of the things that attracted us to the team. That's one.
Number two, the large bank that they came from is stepping away from this sector, mostly because we took the
team. And so the loans sitting on their balance sheet are ripe for the taking. And that's why these guys have only
been on maybe, as I said, six weeks, eight weeks most, they got $90 million outstandings, they've got a very
strong pipeline and they've already been approved for other loans that just need to be taken down by the
borrowers. So, we're off to a good start, and it's very encouraging.
I would say, longer term, there's no reason why this business will not look like our resort financing business, which
has $1 billion of loans. It's just a question of the timing of how we get there. And again, everything we do is safe,
sound, and thoughtful credit granting. So as long as we see loans that fit our credit box, we think the future for this
group is very bright.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then on another one of your national verticals, there's been some shake-up in the HOA business with a
competitor entering that space, so I guess, in a larger scale. What are you seeing from a competitive standpoint
there, and is there any reason to think that the growth trajectory on deposits [indiscernible] (00:48:53)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Good question there as well. Well, first, let me say that our HOA deposit business is killing it. So, in 2020
they had an all-time record in terms of deposit gathering and brought in $683 million. Year-to-date, they have
brought in $1.1 billion. So they've doubled their production of 2020 in only nine months. And so, we're very
optimistic about the continued growth in this area, both on the deposit side, and it gets dwarfed by our balance
sheet, but we're happy with the loan growth that we have there. We have a couple hundred million dollars loans
that are small or an average size, outstanding credit quality, and we'll continue to grow that as we grow the
deposits.
But deposits are – this HOA business is a technology-driven business and many people don't realize that. And
with the upheaval in the market, I could think of two or three banks that are coming together or have purchased
an HOA business. We welcome competition. We're not frightened of it. And our performance to-date indicates that
we'll be able to stand up and continue to grow this segment.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. The $1.9 billion that you referenced with regard to capital call line. Can you contextualize that
a little bit? How big is that outstanding right now? And then could you also just review the overall mix of the legacy
Bridge book? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, there are about over $3 billion, $3.1 billion in both subscription and capital call lines. We see that as a very
opportunistic area for us to continue to grow. Private equity, venture capital funds that are our clients, they're
growing their funds. And as they grow their funds, they need more capital to help enhance their IRRs. And we're
dealing with the brand names that you would know that are publicly traded or very, very well-known. And we really
stepped into this business. We were basically silent on this business two years ago. And so we've kind of stepped
into it and we like the growth prospects there.
In terms of I'll say tech and innovation overall, year-to-date, tech and innovation overall has seen loan growth stay
rather flat. And that's because with all the liquidity in the VC ecosystem, a lot of our loans are getting paid down.
But as I said on our town hall meeting yesterday about the tech and innovation group, when they get lemons, they
make lemonade, and the lemonade that they're making is really on the tech and innovation side in terms of
growing deposits. So they're having just an outstanding year in tech and innovation deposit gathering. They're up
over $800 million. So, again, that helps us fuel other opportunities we have, other places on the balance sheet to
grow loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Was there something – thanks for that color. Was there something in this quarter from the $1.9 billion and to get
to $3.1 billion? I mean that's just quite remarkable in one quarter. Is there anything specific to this quarter that – I
know that the growth has been tremendous for the industry, but basically a doubling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. First let me say it surprised us as well as they grew that quickly. We had been doing – we had granted a
number of – approved a number of subscription lines accounts dating back, bigger ones in size, Q4 of 2020 and
also the first quarter and second quarter of this year. And they just started to get pulled down. Utilization runs
around 50% or thereabouts, and our clients are pulling it down and we're happy that they are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. If I could just sneak one more in, the held-for-sale conversation about that growing kind of over the near-
term, if we took a little bit of a longer view and looked out maybe a couple of years in a higher rate environment,
how would you see this strategy at all – maybe not, the balances be affected?

I think it's going to top out. I'm not exactly sure at what level or when that is. But as we continue to see economic
recovery, we see broadening demand across other sectors, a number of which have higher yield. We think that
this is an accordion. I mean, it's really to us it's almost like a parking in the securities book, except it's rate
sensitive and you can get the money out in three weeks. I mean, these are very short kind of rolls.
So it's an alternative to that. It certainly yields better. And so, we've got excess liquidity with the enormous deposit
growth we've had this year. We're parking it there as an alternative, but we can pull that down quickly. I think that
over time we will. I mean, as we move our loan-to-deposit ratio back up to 90 or wherever it might be, I think some
of that give-up is going to be from here.
I might also say that some of that give-up is going to come from the securities book. We ran up our securities
book hard in 2020 and early 2021, because we didn't have this alternative. We have, I would say, underutilized
deployment in there where we bought RMBS. And we can buy RMBS, they yield a lot less, or we can buy
government-guaranteed puts to the GSEs, basically the same kind of credit risk and make another 100 basis
points.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
One question – I think a lot of the P&L stuff has been beat up pretty well, but one question I had is the commercial
segment and the consumer segment had roughly equal growth, and it looks like your earnings are roughly equal.
Do you think about the business that way? Do you want a balanced business model or do you expect one
segment to outgrow the other over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So we meet, well, on a weekly basis with our senior operating committee, and every week we talk about what's
happening in every market and what's happening with all the products. And it's at that meeting and also at our
senior loan committee meetings where we allocate capital and liquidity as appropriate. So that's what drives us is
where is the best risk-adjusted returns and that's what we push on. We don't really come out and say consumer
versus commercial lines need to be balanced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. Dale, there's been a lot of questions on the burning asset mix and you used the term
optimizing the earning asset mix. Of all the things that you've talked about, if you had to point to one or two that
we can expect to see in the next quarter or two, what would they be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think probably you're going to see kind of a continuation of what we've got so far. I would hope that we're
going to continue to see broadening out of our loan development and production alternatives, and – but at the
same time we've got so much room and so much liquidity to kind of finally flare, I might say. So that could mitigate
what we'd be doing on, say, loans held for sale, as we just discussed or your other factors. But if we've got strong
loan growth, I think we've got opportunities to kind of continue to and maybe trade away. I mean, capital call lines,
we love them. We think they're bulletproof in terms of structure, but they're obviously not the highest yielding thing
we have. And they also consume a little bit more in terms of risk-weighted assets at 100%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. On the non-interest income line, just to kind of put that to bed, I think the message you're
sending is don't expect it to grow at the same pace as net interest income, but it'll show up somewhere in the P&L
and it may bounce around a little bit, but don't necessarily expect fees to keep pace with NII. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I think that's fair.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. And then just one question for you, Ken, on EPS. I actually had to look up asymptote to remind me
what that meant. And so, I'm going to ask you a simple question on the $2.30 EPS that you put up for the quarter.
Anything in there that you think is unsustainable? Even if I put, what's the number, $2 billion of loan growth and I
think it's too low, anything that's unsustainable in the $2.30?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, first, that was Dale showing off [indiscernible] (00:59:02) and we wish him all the best. On the $2.30, really
there was nothing there that's unusual that I would remove that would lower EPS. I think that's a fairly good base
to use. And then I see where you're going, take the incremental jump-off on the ending loan balance to the
average loan balance of $3.3 billion, make some assumptions on how we deploy cash, and take your Q3 to Q4
earnings or move them in that direction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, if you look at the third quarter, I mean, we have a spectacular operating leverage on a linked-quarter
basis. I think expenses were up 6% of the amount of revenue. That trend is not obviously sustainable, but
consistent with our guide that we should be in the lower 40s. So from here, I don't think that there's anything that
you really have to pull back from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Chiaverini with Wedbush.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hey, thanks. I have a follow up on the size of the held for sale portfolio. You mentioned about it rising with
deposits. But when I look at the period-end balance versus the average, it's lower. And I would assume that, and I
may be stating the obvious here, but it would be a function of mortgage origination levels. So, for instance, over
the summer months when you're originating, say, $20 billion, if we go into the winter months and you're
originating $10 billion and you're holding these loans for three weeks, I imagine that those held on the balance
sheet would be lower through the winter. But can you talk about that a little bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, actually it's more kind of liquidity balancing for us. I appreciate your comment. And it is based on kind of
originations. But these are sold in short forwards to the GSEs for delivery. And we just extended that a little bit.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
What we do though is we extend those a little bit more so that they come due in the middle of the month rather
than at the end. If you have the kind of – if you saw our daily balance sheet, you can kind of infer this from what
you've seen before, we tend to run up on loans toward the end of a month and toward the end of a quarter. So
there's a little bit of trough in the middle. And you see this on our loan book which has for the quarter north of $3
billion lower average than the ending. And so, now we're in this period of flatlining where our loan growth so far
has gone up a little, but not a lot in the fourth quarter. That's pretty typical and then kicks in as we could go later in
the year.
So what we've done is we run up the held-for-sale book early on in the quarter. It gets you to a higher average.
And then when the loan book spikes at quarter-end, we drive the held-for-sale balance down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Very helpful. And then you mentioned about the gain-on-sale margin, you're expecting it to approach the
2018 level. Can you remind us what that margin was in 2018?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It was on the high-30s in 2018.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. And then shifting to that new team in Texas, the single-family home construction CRE national business
line, you sized the restaurant franchise finance and that could get to $1 billion. Can you give us a sense of how
big you expect this team in this portfolio to grow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'm having a little trouble giving you that number because there are several factors that come into play, housing
permits, the churn and all that. But we wouldn't have gone into this area and hired this team unless we thought
that over time we could get to about the same level as the food franchise group. I just don't know how quickly
they're going to get there, but they've got a very strong pipeline. We're very active in terms of helping them and
flying down there and working with them and their client base. So, a lot of optimism around it. But I would say I
think you should use the same billion dollar number for the food franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
