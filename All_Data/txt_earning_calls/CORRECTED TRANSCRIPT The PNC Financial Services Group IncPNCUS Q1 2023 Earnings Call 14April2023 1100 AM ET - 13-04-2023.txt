Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
For the past month, we've seen market volatility across the broader industry. And while we take this situation
seriously and are closely monitoring the environment, it's important to note that these events have taken place
within a few banks with very unique business models.
Inside of our company, we really haven't seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month. Our
balance sheet remains strong and stable, and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the
beginning of March.
Ultimately, over time, we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in
the competitive landscape. And while it's still early innings, we believe that PNC will be a beneficiary from this
process.
That said, in the near term, we're not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will
ultimately impact our NII in the near term, and Rob's going to cover that in more detail in a second. We remain
focused on growing relationships across our lines of business, and we continued to execute on key priorities,
including the expansion in the BBVA legacy markets.
Rob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment. However, for this particular call, he'll
review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet
focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks. And of course, following that,
we'll be able to discuss your specific questions in the Q&A segment. Finally, I'd like to thank our 61,000
employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers.
Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.

Robert Q. Reilly
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.
Loans for the first quarter were $326 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1% linked quarter. Investment securities
were relatively stable at $143 billion.
Cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and increased $4 billion during the quarter. Deposits
of $436 billion grew on both a spot and average basis linked quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $4
billion, which reflected fourth quarter 2022 activity as well as senior note issuances in January of this year.
At quarter-end, our tangible book value was $76.90 per common share, an increase of 7% linked quarter. And we
remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% as of March 31, 2023.
During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders, which included $600 million of common
dividends and approximately $370 million of share repurchases or 2.4 million shares. Due to market conditions
and increased economic uncertainty, we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter.
And of course, we'll continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate.
Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. During the first quarter, loan balances averaged $326 billion,
an increase of $4 billion or 1%, largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Deposits averaged $436 billion in the first quarter, increasing $1.3 billion.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
We continue to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, and I will cover that in more detail in a
few minutes. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.66% during the first quarter from 1.07% in
the fourth quarter of 2022. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 35%.
Turning to the income statement on slide 6. As you can see, first quarter 2023 reported net income was $1.7
billion or $3.98 per share. Total revenues of $5.6 billion decreased $160 million compared to the fourth quarter of
2022. Net interest income decreased $99 million or 3%, primarily driven by two fewer days in the quarter and
higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets.
Our net interest margin of 2.84% declined 8 basis points, reflecting the increased funding costs I just mentioned.
Noninterest income also declined 3% or $61 million, as growth in asset management and brokerage was more
than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity, as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction
volumes.
First quarter expenses declined $153 million or 4% linked quarter, even after accounting for the increase to the
FDIC's deposit assessment rate, which equated to $25 million. Provision was $235 million in the first quarter and
included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality.
And our effective tax rate was 17.2%.
Turning to slide 7. We highlight our revenue and expense trends. As a result of our diversified revenue streams
and expense management efforts, we generated positive operating leverage of 2% linked quarter and 15%
compared to the same period a year ago. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $400
million in 2023 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we will achieve our full year
target. And as you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology
investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 8. Nonperforming loans remained stable at $2 billion and continue to
represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $164 million or 11% linked
quarter. Notably, the delinquency rate of 41 basis points is our lowest level in over a decade.
Net charge-offs were $195 million, a decrease of $29 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to
average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the first quarter, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion
or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, essentially stable with year-end 2022.
Before I provide an update on our forward guidance, as Bill mentioned, we want to take a deeper dive into some
of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities and
swaps, capital and liquidity, and the impact of potential regulatory changes and, finally, office exposure within our
commercial real estate portfolio. In our view, we believe we're well positioned across all these key areas of focus.
Turning to slide 10. Our $437 billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories
to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, our deposits
were 53% consumer and 47% commercial. Inside of our $230 billion of consumer deposits, approximately 90%
are FDIC insured. The portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately $11,500
across nearly 20 million accounts throughout our coast-to-coast franchise.
Our $207 billion of commercial deposits are 20% insured, but importantly, approximately 95% of the total
balances are held in operating and relationship accounts. These include deposits held as compensating balances
to pay for treasury management fees, escrow deposits at Midland Loan Services and broader relationship

accounts, all of which tend to provide more stability than deposit-only accounts. Importantly, we have
approximately 1.4 million commercial deposit accounts, representing a diverse set of industries and geographies.
Turning to slide 11. We highlight our mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Our consumer
deposits, noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
The commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing
deposits, as rates have risen and that has played out, albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected.
The commercial noninterest-bearing portion of total deposits was 45% as of March 31, down from 58% a year
ago. Importantly, commercial noninterest-bearing deposits include the compensating balances in Midland escrow
deposits I mentioned previously, which provides support to this mix through time.
On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% at the end of the first quarter of 2023,
down from 33% a year ago. PNC has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing
deposits relative to the banking industry, due in part to strength of our treasury management business and
granular deposit base.
As a result, we expect our noninterest-bearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages and
approach the mid-20% range by year-end 2023. In addition to our mix shift, we have seen a faster increase in our
deposit costs this year, as the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates.
Slide 12 shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of 2023. The
increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the
intensity and focus on rates paid and, ultimately, has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we
previously expected. We expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in May. This,
coupled with heightened competition for deposits, has accelerated our expectations for the level and pace of beta
increase, and we now expect to reach a terminal beta of 42% by year-end.
Slide 13 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Our securities balance averaged $143 billion in the
first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 13 basis
points to 2.49%, as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates. Yields on new purchases during
the quarter exceeded 4.75%.
Our portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of 4.3 years, meaningfully shorter than many of
our peers. Approximately two-thirds of our securities are recorded as held to maturity and one-third as available
for sale.
Average security balances represent approximately 28% of interest-earning assets. Our received fixed swaps
pointing to the commercial loan book remained largely stable at $42 billion in notional value and 2.25-year
duration. At the end of the first quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by $1.1 billion or
10% to $9.1 billion, driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the
securities and swaps pull to par.
Slide 14 highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related AOCI runoff. By the
end of 2024, we expect about 26% of our securities and swaps to roll off. This will drive increases in our securities
and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement, as we expect approximately
40% AOCI accretion by the end of year 2024.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
Slide 15 highlights our strong liquidity position. Our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the
first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter. Our cash balances at the Federal
Reserve totaled $34 billion, and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other
funding sources.
PNC has a robust liquidity management process, which includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio
assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation. In addition, we perform monthly internal
liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios.
Our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately 17% and reached an
unprecedented low level of 6% in 2021. On March 31, our mix was 12% and we expect to move closer to the
historical average over time. In light of the current environment, we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss
absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point, with a reasonable phase-in period. Importantly,
as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level, we would expect to be compliant through
our current issuance plans under existing TLAC requirements.
Slide 16 shows our solid capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% at quarter-end. As a Category III
institution, we don't include AOCI in our CET1 ratio, but understand why there is focus on this ratio with the
inclusion of AOCI. As of March 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, was estimated to be 7.5%, which
remains above our 7.4% required level, taking into account our current stress capital buffer.
However, we also believe it's important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of a bank from a market
value of equity perspective, similar to our understanding of Basel IRRBB rules. Market value of equity doesn't truly
get reflected on the balance sheet today due to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which results in a
skewed approach of valuing certain items primarily on the asset side.
While AOCI takes into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios, it
does not account for the valuation of the deposit book, which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate
environment. In fact, looking at PNC's change in market value of equity over the past year, the increase in the
market value of our deposits in a rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized
losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, including securities and fixed rate loans.
Total market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment and, further, our duration of
equity is now essentially zero and well positioned in the current environment. Importantly, our models use
conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas, mix, balances and deposit lives.
We also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of
QE and fiscal stimulus, which were likely to be short-lived. Recall, our Fed balances peaked in the first quarter of
2021 around $86 billion. As a result, we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction
of the value of core deposits.
Turning to slide 17. I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio. While
credit quality is strong across the majority of our CRE book, office is the segment receiving a lot of attention in this
environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. So, we thought it would be worthwhile to
highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $8.9 billion or
2.7% of our total loans in our office portfolio.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
Turning to slide 18. You can see the composition of this portfolio, which is well diversified across geography,
tenant type and property classification. Reserves against these loans, which we have built over several quarters,
now total 7.1%, a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses.
In regard to our underwriting approach, we adhere to conservative standards, focus on attractive markets and
work with experienced, well-capitalized sponsors. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to
value of 55% to 60% and a significant majority of those properties are defined as Class A.
We have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans
and test reserve adequacy. We don't solely rely on third-party appraisals, which will naturally be slow to adjust to
the rapidly shifting market conditions. Rather, we are stress testing property performance to set realistic
expectations.
To appropriately sensitize our portfolio, we significantly discounted net operating income levels and property
values across the entire office book. Additionally, tenant retention, build-out costs and concession levels are all
updated to accurately reflect market conditions.
Credit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only 0.2% of loans delinquent, 3.5% nonperforming,
and a net charge-off rate of 47 basis points over the last 12 months. Along those lines, we continue to see solid
performance within the single tenant, medical and government loans, which represent 40% of our total office
portfolio. These have occupancy levels above 90% and watch-list levels of 3% or less.
Where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets is in our multi-tenant loans, which
represents 58% of our office portfolio. Multi-tenant loans are currently running in the mid-70% occupancy range,
watch-list levels are greater than 30%, and 60% of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of 2024.
In the near term, this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension, comprises the
largest portion of our office reserves. Multi-tenant reserves on a stand-alone basis are 9.4%. Obviously, we'll
continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions.
For each of the key areas of focus I just discussed, we believe we are well positioned, and slide 19 summarizes
our balance sheet strength during this volatile time. Our deposits are up, our capital and liquidity positions are
strong, and our overall credit quality is solid.
In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we are
expecting a recession starting in the second half of 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path
assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in May. Following that, we expect the Fed to
pause rate actions until early 2024, when we expect a 25 basis point cut.
Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth
of 1% to 3%, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth to be up 4% to 5%. Inside
of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 8%.
At this point, visibility remains challenging and our full year NII guidance assumes the continuation of the recent
intensity on deposit pricing, which is being driven by recent events. We expect noninterest income to be stable,
expenses to be up 2% to 3%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this
guidance, we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in 2023.

Looking at the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect average loans to be
stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 4%, fee income to be stable to down 1%. Other noninterest income
to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity.
Taking all the component pieces, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3%. We expect total
noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200
million and $250 million. Further, given our strong credit metrics, our credit quality is trending better than our
expectations.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
No, it was great. You guys – that was a great job. I have two questions. One is on the deposit beta. When you're
talking about the 42%, obviously, that is aligned with the outlook that you just expressed for interest rate
movements.
I guess, I wanted to just understand how you're thinking about the flex between deposit beta and deposit growth,
because part of me says, hey, I could have expected even more deposit growth than you gave me Q-Q. And is
there a rate paid element to that that maybe you're holding back on and that's why the deposits weren't maybe as
high as what some folks like me had hoped?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We're sitting here puzzled. We grew deposits average and spot against a backdrop of – absent the volatility in the
market, deposits still overall leaving the system, particularly government money funds and then the shrinkage of
the total on the back...

With QT.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
QT. Our rate paid, if you look year-on-year, I think our total deposits are down 3% or something, which is less
than most anybody we'd compare to. And we have purposefully been protecting the franchise in the course of
doing that. I recognize some other people don't do that and that's – we'll see how that plays out through time. But
I – we kind of feel we outperformed on deposits, so I'm a little bit...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
In the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...puzzled by your question. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. No, Q-Q definitely, and I would expect after all of the banks finish reporting, we can have a better
conversation on this. I was just wondering if you felt that. If you had a slightly higher rate paid, would you have
pulled in more? And I suppose the way you answered that question is, you don't feel the need to. So, that's great.
And then just separately, as a fallout of what has happened with SIVB, Signature, et cetera, do you feel like
there's any need at all to reassess the duration of the commercial operating account deposit liability life. Is that
something that, having seen what happened at SIVB, you would want to take a closer look at? Or do you feel like
it's just such a different animal, given what you outlined on slide 10 with the granularity you've got? Thanks.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, first of all, we look at that all the time. And as Rob put into his comments, a large portion of the deposit
growth that we saw through COVID. So, stimulus in the Fed – the growth in the Fed's balance sheet, we just
assumed had a life of a day, zero, because we're in an abnormal period of time.
The core operating deposits that we have, particularly as you go in the middle market, are basically the working
capital monies that companies use to run their companies. We truncate and always have truncated the modeled
lives of those deposits well below what the practical experience would show us, yeah. So, it's conservative.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I guess, this question goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished. Your operating leverage in the
first quarter year-over-year was over 10%. You've guided for positive operating leverage this year of 1% to 3%.
Your cycle-to-date beta, I estimate being below 40%. So, all that looks really good. But on the other hand, you
did, I guess, lower your guidance for how much positive operating leverage this year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
You mentioned NII. You mentioned the intensity on deposit pricing. So, just can you help talk about the trade-off
of pursuing growth with more deposits versus maybe scaling back if that deposit pricing is really that much more
intense? Or do you see that not being so at some point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think, Mike, part of the issue that we face here is you have a interest rate forward curve that's suggesting cuts
out there. So, if you believe that, betas would be less. We kind of think the Fed's going to hold through the year
and cut next year. Personally, I think they might hold longer than that. So, everybody's NII guide is going to be all
over the place depending on what they actually think the Fed's doing as we go into this – the back end of this
year.
Separately, we have seen just this heightened awareness of interest rates and what you do with deposits on the
back of the banks that failed. You've seen the growth in the government money funds on the back of the Fed's
reverse repo facility, which is a real thing.
As long as they allow that to keep growing, they're at the market deposits, but they're basically getting drained
from the banking system and making liquidity more expensive. So, that's – we took all that into account and said,
look, if rates are higher for longer, if the Fed keeps draining deposits through its reverse repo facility, the smaller
banks really need to pay up super high rates to fund their balance sheets. It's going to be painful for us, and that's
what we put in our guide. That may or may not happen.

And I would just add, we've got a focus on our core franchise and our clients. So, on the commercial side, it's
really the effect of commercial clients choosing to switch to interest-bearing from noninterest-bearing.

And the relationship's fully intact. And then on the consumer side, as Bill just mentioned, the interest-bearing
deposits and the pressure around rates paid there.

And the one other point you guys have made is that either NII will be better or you might have to – you might get
to release some of your credit reserves. Have you seen any improvement in that loan pricing commensurate with
some of the standards – in the capital markets, you're pricing for risk a lot more; in the lending markets, you have
not been pricing for risk and you brought...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Our new production is a little bit better than it was, but in fairness, at the moment, credit looks much better than
we otherwise would have assumed. So, it's a trade-off.
Now, it's going to be interesting, Mike, because the marginal cost of funds for the US banking system has just
gone up a lot as a result of this flurry. And so, all else equal, you would expect credit spreads to widen here
simply because the cost of funds for all banks has gone up. I haven't seen that play out yet, but it continues to be
at least my expectation that it will.

AOCI...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...yeah, AOCI for banks our size and they may well do that. Part of me, though – the reason we put economic
value of equity in our presentation is, as soon as you start isolating specific fixed rate assets and ignore others.
So, what do you do with fixed rate whole loan mortgages, what do you do with held to – it's all the same stuff. It's
an accounting entry.
And so, I would hope that they would have a more holistic look as they do in Europe on measuring balance sheet
risk to interest rates. I don't know where that's going to end up. And whatever it is they do is going to take a period
of time. TLAC, I think, is a certainty at this point. It's a function of how much it'll be and whether it's varied as a
function of size and complexity of bank.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
By the way, the issue, it's just – it's worth mentioning basic interest rate risk management and the test around
liquidity that banks go through, I mean, we did this, we run this stuff every single day with all sorts of different
scenarios and that the regulators require us to and we get measured on it, [indiscernible] (33:29).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And, look, I don't even know who was looking at these other banks. So, to come in and say we ought to do more,
we're already doing it is, I guess, my point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very clear. And I'm glad you guys put the whole balance sheet, the equity valuation because that message has to
get out, and I'm glad you guys did that. So, thank you.
Moving on to commercial and industrial loans, you guys have seen really good growth over the past year. Can
you give us a little more color on do you see a re-intermediation coming into the banking system because the
capital markets are still disrupted? Or is it just you guys have had success with BBVA and that's working for you?
Can you give us some color on that growth that you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
A couple of comments. If you look back through our history, when we enter new markets, this is particularly
through – back through RBC and what we've seen with BBVA. We tend to grow loans at a pace in the new
markets that would be above what you would expect in a long-term trend and then over time, we cross-sell into
those new relationships. So, I almost think of it as – it's kind of advertising dollars, you otherwise participate in a
deal on the hope that you're going to get [ph] TM (34:52) revenue and other things.
What we'll see going forward is the cross-sell into the new relationships we've established. The ability to continue
to grow loans at that pace should we choose to is probably still there. Do you get paid for it today the way you did
when rates were much lower...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

Not so much.

that buzz. By the way, I've heard the buzz the other way. All else equal, I suspect the long-term trend will be less

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And I agree on the slide deck, very, very helpful detail. Thanks for giving it. On the deposit front, just a couple
additional bit of detail, the beta expectation, the terminal beta, 42% looks a little bit more conservative than the
group and probably appropriately so. So, it's good to see it. Can you maybe give us how that breaks down by way
of commercial deposit beta expectation at this point versus consumer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Hey, John, good morning. It's Rob. The way that we look at it in terms of
determining where we're going to end up and, again, it's an expectation. We'll see how it plays out ultimately, but
you're on the right track.
So, if you take a look at our total deposits of $437 billion and you take commercial and the high net worth, the
consumer portion which is high net worth, which is around $230 billion, those betas have moved. They're already
at terminal. It's done.
So, that leaves roughly $200 billion or so in consumer deposits. As I mentioned in my comments, 10% of those
are noninterest-bearing, which are transactional accounts, so we don't expect a change. So, you're at $170 billion,
the minority of our total deposits of interest-bearing consumer deposits that are sort of in play and that we expect

to pay higher rates on. So, that's how we get to maybe a more conservative number than what you're seeing on
peers that don't have the same mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. That's helpful. Also on the deposit front, if I could also a little more detail, on the amount of inflows that you
may have seen during the March time period around the failures, can you maybe quantify the amount and if you
expect any outflow of any of those inflows that you saw?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, we did see in mid-March, we saw some inflows during that week that – at the height of the disruption,
but a lot of that's settled out. So, we don't expect to see that be a factor for us positively or negatively as we move
into the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The only thing I'd say, we actually opened in March twice the number of accounts in our C&I franchise that we
would otherwise open in a month. So, away from the deposits that came in, we actually got a bunch of clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The deposits will stay and get mixed, some will go, but we grew our account portfolio pretty substantially in one
month.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. If I could put one more in there. Just on the office front, do you happen to have perhaps the
refreshed LTVs that you're starting to see in that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's a good question, and I haven't seen them, but it's worth. I don't know we put in the deck or not, but we
underwrite to what 55 to 60.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah. And all of that stuff is stale and all of the appraisals that you get are stale. And so, in effect, what we end up
doing is you assume that less leases renew than you otherwise would in a normal cash flow analysis. You drop
that pretty materially. You assume that lease rates, all else equal, are going to go down and then you have to put
in the rehab costs to re-lease it. And then you discount at a lower rate. So, we've done all that building by

William Stanton Demchak A

...multi-tenant. Effectively, you're saying, all right, I can have 20% of Class A office default and lose $0.50 on the
dollar on a portfolio that was originally underwritten at 60%. That's a pretty severe outcome.

...terminal beta assumption. And it looks like that would get you back to pre-COVID levels on slide 11, I think. How
are you thinking about the risk that that noninterest-bearing mix will continue to fall, not just to pre-COVID levels,
but potentially even lower? Perhaps some have talked about [indiscernible] (41:44).

Yeah, it's a good question. Yeah, we can see and we take a look at the nature of the accounts, mid-20s is our

basis of the nature of the operating accounts that we have. That is, we just were mentioning, we know really well

indication.

Understood. And then separately, following up on your commentary around potential regulatory uncertainty. In
light of [indiscernible] (42:27) recent Senate testimony, so hoping you could address broadly how you're all
thinking about the levers at your disposal to the extent that the regulatory environment grows more challenging,
certainly, your – it seems like you're well positioned. But in terms of levers, whether it's RWA growth, buyback,
dividend, if you could just frame how you think about those to the extent that it does get more challenging.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Not sure. If you put AOCI in, we're already kind of over the threshold. All else equal, I think we're well positioned

repurchase, but most of that is to kind of wait out the current environment, get through earnings and see where
we are. I don't see any issue coming out of regulation that we won't be able to handle in the due course.

Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So, you reduced the full year 2023 loan growth
expectation a bit. I was wondering if you could comment for a second on how much of that is sort of lower either
existing or anticipated demand. And how much is you guys just sort of being more conservative about where
you'd hope to kind of direct your capital and liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a great question. It's probably 50/50. So, demand has softened a little bit. And then the marginal cost of [ph]
sinky (44:23) new clients has gone up, so we're a little more picky than we were. It's probably 50/50.

how things might evolve.

I'm not sure. We haven't seen anything with our legacy clients in terms of behavior. Now, they've – we've seen
money go into sweep accounts, government funds from corporates and individuals largely is a function of rate. I
don't know that it has anything to do with diversification. Now, as you go for smaller banks, I suppose that could
become an issue depending on how much visibility there is into that particular bank's balance sheet, but we just
haven't seen any of that.

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, guys. I just want to dig on the guidance a little bit. The second quarter
guidance is clear for the revenue step-down. And kind of that implies in the full year guide that second half
revenue is pretty equal to first half revenue. I'm just wondering if you can kind of maybe give us some NII versus
fees. And are you expecting any just better stability or increase as you go through the year perhaps in fees versus
what might happen in NII? Thanks.

Okay. I think you're asking in terms of the full year. So, we've given you the new guidance around our NII and
then we've been through that. As far as fees go, we're calling it to be stable year-over-year and there's some
moving parts in there. Some of the fee categories are doing a little better than we expected. Some are doing a
little bit worse, but altogether, it's still stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And within that, can I just ask you a question, your Harris Williams business has just been a great one over
the years. In this environment, obviously, M&A is slower, but is there also...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Is there any sense or chance that also like midsized companies have to do a rethink here? I'm just kind of
wondering just where you think the pipelines and outlook are for that business specifically. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, Harris Williams, you're accurate in terms of – that's our biggest driver of our capital markets/advisory
businesses, and they had a slower-than-usual quarter in the first quarter, obviously reflecting a lot of the
disruption. And the pipelines are still pretty good. We're not expecting a big rebound in the second quarter, but
potentially in the second half, but to your point, a lot of that depends on the psychology at the time and the ability
and the support for both buyers and sellers to do deals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Hey, Rob, one more quick one. I know your footnote on your beta slide says that you don't include time
deposits in your beta calcs. Are we generally to assume that the beta on time deposits is obviously very high, just
given what we know to the earlier point that Bill made about industry funding costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. And again, that's a conventional measure. So, that's not our own personal PNC measure, that's
how the industry calculates it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question from the line [ph] Stefan Sheth (48:36) with Point72. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yes. Thank you. A quick question, if I may, on the commercial real estate, a follow-up one on criticized loans on
slide 18. You say 20%, twice as much as the rest of your commercial real estate book. So, I would just like to
understand what was this number before and how you would expect this number to evolve from here. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm sorry. I didn't follow all of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[indiscernible] (49:05)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. On slide 18, you mention that our office criticized loan ratio is 20%. I just would like to know, what was this
number before for previous quarters and how you expect this number to evolve from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, the 2.7%, no, it's been pretty steady. So, it's been a small percentage of our total commercial real estate,
hasn't changed nor do we expect it, certainly not to go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Understood. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Next question from the line of Alan Davis, NatWest Markets. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi. Thank you very much. Yeah. Alan Davis here from NatWest Markets. Just a very quick question and echo
what everybody said, the disclosure and information here is fantastic. With all the market noise that went on after
SVB and I totally get the difference, and I totally agree with what you're saying about the accounting standards
and so on.
Nevertheless, there's a lot of keen interest in the unrealized losses on the hold-to-maturity portfolio. Are you able
to provide any color or guidance there? I don't think all of that would be in AOCI. Is there anything that you can
help guide me with in that regard?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
To add on held to maturity, so inside of AOCI today is one number and then we have another smaller loss in held
to maturity we disclosed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
$3.5 billion. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
