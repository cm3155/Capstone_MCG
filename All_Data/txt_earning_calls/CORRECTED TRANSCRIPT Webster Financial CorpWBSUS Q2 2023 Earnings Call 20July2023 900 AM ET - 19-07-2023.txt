Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Thanks, Emlen. Good morning, and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's second quarter 2023 earnings
call. We appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll provide remarks on our high-level results and operations
before turning it over to Glenn to cover our financial results in greater detail. Webster's results in the quarter
illustrate the competitive advantages of our funding profile. While we experienced some temporary NIM
headwinds as we pulled liquidity onto our balance sheet early in the quarter, overall, our diverse and distinctive
deposit gathering channels provided steady funding as we grew deposits significantly and increased our off-
balance sheet liquidity. Glenn will provide more specific detail on balance sheet trends in his remarks.
In the face of industry challenges, we are proud of our financial performance in the quarter. On an adjusted basis,
we generated EPS of $1.50. While we saw a modest 1.9% quarter-over-quarter decline in net interest income, we
anticipate a positive trajectory through the remainder of the year. Our other income statement lines exhibited
positive trends as we grew noninterest income and maintained flat expenses. Despite maintaining a higher than
normal liquidity position, we generated an adjusted ROA of just under 1.4% and an adjusted return on tangible
common equity of 20.4%. We grew our deposits by over 6% in the quarter. Our robust funding profile positioned
us to continue to serve our clients, and we grew our loan book by 1.4%. Our strong deposit growth allowed us to
reduce our loan to deposit ratio to 88%, which provides us balance sheet flexibility as we move forward.
If you turn to slide 3, I want to reemphasize the unique funding model that enabled this performance. We have a
diverse set of deposit generating businesses, each with distinct client dynamics. This model provides us with a
funding advantage as characteristics of the various businesses, partially mitigate the effects of general industry
deposit outflows. While we are not immune to the higher funding costs the banking industry is experiencing, we
like our competitive positioning on that front, and we have the ability to grow core deposits through environments
in which others are challenged. Our consumer deposits are largely originated in footprint to long tenured clients.
Our $8 billion plus of HSA deposits are all in individual customer accounts and nearly all are within FDIC
insurance limits. As most of you are aware, this is a particular unique source of low cost and long duration
deposits.
Within Commercial Banking, we have $2 billion of business banking deposits that share similar characteristics to
the consumer book. The remainder of commercial deposits are diverse by industry, customer type and
geography, and are aligned with our relationship banking model. And finally, interLINK, a platform we acquired
earlier this year, provides readily available core deposit funding at a low cost of acquisition, with nearly all
deposits covered by FDIC insurance.
On slide 4, you can see that not only did we grow deposits smartly, but immediately available liquidity also
increased to $18 billion, which covers just under 125% of our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. Our
balance sheet remains in exceptionally sound condition. As Glenn will discuss further on subsequent slides,
things remain stable from an overall credit perspective. While we do not see any significant signs of broad credit
weakness, we continue to act prudently and proactively with respect to managing our existing loan portfolio and
onboarding new credit, given the existing macro uncertainties.
I want to once again touch briefly on our office portfolio. You can see that on slide 5, as that's continued, [ph] I
note (00:04:40), to be an area of market focus. We have proactively reduced the size of our non-medical office
portfolio, which is now down by almost $400 million over the last year, or roughly 25%. We've done so without
incurring significant losses as our charge-off rate on this relatively small portion of the office portfolio is under 2%
on an annualized basis. The overall credit characteristics of this portfolio have not changed materially as you can
see in the figures we provide on LTV, debt service coverage, and other metrics. While our criticized and classified
loans are up modestly from last quarter, they are down relative to fourth quarter and the year ago period given the
proactive actions we've taken.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Consistent with my comments above, while we are pleased with performance to date, we fully appreciate the
changing dynamics in commercial real estate, and we continue to manage our portfolios and credit selection
accordingly and prudently.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more details on the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings. We
reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $231 million, earnings per share of $1.32. On an adjusted
basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $261 million and EPS of $1.50 excluding one-time
merger-related expense of $30 million. Merger expenses were primarily related to professional fees, severance
and technology cost.
Next, I'll review our balance sheet trends beginning on slide 7. Total assets were $74 billion at period end, down
$800 million from the first quarter, largely as a result of shifting from on-balance sheet cash to off-balance sheet
liquidity sources. At quarter end, we held $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which approximates the level of
cash we anticipate holding going forward. Loan growth was $700 million, principally driven by commercial
banking. Our security balances were relatively flat in the quarter as we reinvested proceeds from maturities to
sales. Deposits grew $3.5 billion in the quarter and we reduced our borrowings by more than $4 billion. Deposit
growth was achieved despite a $700 million seasonal decline in public funds quarter-over-quarter. As a result of
the loan and deposit growth, our loan to deposit ratio was 88% at quarter end, down from 92% in the prior quarter.
Our capital levels remained strong. Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.66%, and our tangible common equity
ratio was 7.23%. Tangible book value increased to $29.69 a share, with retained earnings exceeding the impact
of AOCI and a small share repurchase. Unrealized security losses included in tangible book value increased to
$645 million after tax from $560 million last quarter, driven by higher rates. In a steady interest rate environment,
we anticipate roughly $100 million of this will accrete back into capital annually.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 8. In total, we grew loans by $700 million or 1.4% on a linked quarter basis.
Loan growth was concentrated in the Commercial Bank, where we continue to see opportunities in strategic
segments. C&I grew $85 million with an additional $125 million in sponsor. Commercial real estate was up $150
million. Mortgage warehouse grew $235 million consistent with seasonal trends and residential mortgage grew
$140 million. The yield on the portfolio increased 26 basis points. And excluding accretion, the loan yield
increased 27 basis points. Floating and periodic loans remained at 60% of total at quarter end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 9. Total deposits of $3.5 billion from prior quarter were 6.2%.
Growth was primarily driven by interLINK and time deposits. Time deposit growth was driven by $1.9 billion of
brokered deposits and $900 million in Consumer Banking CDs. Roughly half the consumer time deposit growth
was from existing clients shifting into higher yielding products. A quarter was from the balance increase of existing
clients and a quarter of the growth came from new clients.
Commercial deposits grew $700 million when excluding the seasonal decline in public funds. We have started to
recapture funds that were diversified across financial institutions earlier this year. We're seeing new opportunities
for growth in transactional accounts. Our total deposit costs were up 61 basis points to 172 basis points for a
cumulative cycle to date total deposit beta of 34%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
On slide 10, we have updated the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions. We anticipate a total
cumulative deposit beta of 40% by the first quarter of 2024, which is up modestly from our prior projection due to
client preferences for higher yielding deposit flows. As you can see in the chart on the right, we expect the pace of
our deposit cost increase to moderate over the next few quarters.
Moving to slide 11, we highlighted our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings
for the prior period. Net interest income was down $11.5 million or 1.9% linked quarter, primarily reflecting
increased funding costs. Adjusted noninterest income was up $2 million, while expenses remained effectively flat.
The net interest margin was 3.35%, down 31 basis points from prior quarter, with 12 basis points from temporary
actions to increase our liquidity position. And the efficiency ratio was 42%.
I'll discuss each major line item on subsequent slides. On slide 12, we highlight net interest income, which
declined $11.5 million linked quarter or 1.9%. Net interest margin excluding accretion, decreased 30 basis points
from the prior quarter. Our yield on earning assets, excluding accretion, increased 24 basis points over prior
quarter and the total cost of funds was up 58 basis points. The change in the cost of funds was driven by mix
change in deposits as well as additional liquidity we added early in the quarter.
A significant driver for the linked quarter decline in NIM was an increase in the average balance sheet liquidity of
$2.6 billion. While this did not impact net interest income, it had 12 basis point impact on our NIM relative to prior
quarter. Higher funding costs drove the remainder of the decline and deposit competition [ph] increased
(00:11:17).
On slide 13, we highlight our noninterest income for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income was up
$2 million linked quarter. Primary driver was in increased valuation marks of the client hedging activity.
Transaction activity tied to commercial clients remained slow in the second quarter, but we're seeing some signs
of modest improvement in the coming quarters. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by $12 million
in lower client hedging activity, $7 million in lower loan related fees, $6 million in lower client deposit fees, $4
million due to outsourcing of our consumer investment services platform.
Noninterest expense is on slide 14. We reported adjusted expense of $303 million in line with the prior quarter. A
reduction in professional fees and technology expense was offset by higher employee benefit expense and
deposit insurance.
Slide 15 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which was up $15 million over prior quarter. After
recording $20 million in net charge-offs, we incurred $35 million in provision expense, with loan growth
representing $8 million, and the remainder due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. You see our
allowance coverage [ph] to (00:12:29) loans increased slightly to 122 basis points.
Slide 16 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, non-performing assets increased $35 million
from prior quarter. Non-performing loans represent 42 basis points of loans. Non-performing assets remained
within the range of the past year and were down $28 million from a year ago.
Commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial loans declined to 1.39% from 1.47%, as classified loans
declined $25 million on an absolute basis. Net charge-offs in the upper right totaled $20 million or 16 basis points
of average loans on an annualized basis. Notably, we divested $80 million in commercial real estate loans in the
quarter, vast majority of which were secured by office properties. These divestitures generated $13 million
charge-offs.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
On slide 17, we continue to maintain strong capital levels. All capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and
internal targets. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.66%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.23%.
Tangible book value increased to $29.69 a share. Including the AFS mark on our securities portfolio, common
equity Tier 1 ratio would be approximately 9.4% as of June 30.
We don't anticipate we'll be subject to explicit changes to the regulatory capital requirements, but are well
prepared for any potential changes as evidenced by our capital ratios inclusive of AOCI and our strong liquidity
position.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 18 with our full year outlook. We expect to grow loans in the range of 4% to 6%
with growth focused in strategic segments. We expect to grow core deposits 8% to 10% with the year end loan to
deposit ratio in the mid-80s. We expect net interest income of $2.350 billion, $2.375 million on a non-FTE basis
excluding accretion. Approximately $25 million in accretion would be added to net interest income outlook. For
those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly $65 million to the outlook.
Our net interest income outlook includes the growth expectations above, along with the 25 basis point Fed hike
next week. We assume the Fed funds rate will remain flat for the remainder of 2023 at 5.5%. We currently expect
NIM to improve by 10 to 15 basis points from the second quarter level to the remainder of the year. Noninterest
income should be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. Core expenses are expected to be in the $1.2
billion, $1.225 billion range with an efficiency ratio in the 40% to 42% range. We expect our effective tax rate in
the range of 22%. We'll continue to be prudent managers of capital. Capital actions will be dependent on the
market environment. We continue to target a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.5%.
With that, I'll turn it back over to John for closing remarks.

John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks a lot, Glenn. I'll wrap up my remarks today with a short update on our integration and strategic path
forward. We're approaching an important integration milestone this weekend with the conversion of our core
operating systems. As many of you are aware, we took a deliberate and thoughtful approach to the conversion of
our core. A tremendous amount of work has gone into this event as our teams' been working diligently to
accomplish the smoothest experience possible for our clients, while at the same time maintaining a level of
service they have come to expect.
We completed three mock conversions over the first half of 2023 and have been proactively communicating with
clients in recent weeks. We've already enabled our entire ATM network to access consolidated core, and our
frontline colleagues have been trained on new systems and procedures. Several of our back office systems have
already been consolidated and we're excited to complete this meaningful step from an operational perspective.
Post-conversion, we'll be able to accelerate our strategic technology plans, and we'll be in a position to further
realize additional synergies.
I want to thank all of our colleagues who are focused on conversion, whether in a dedicated role or through our
continued focus on taking care of our clients across our footprint. We'll continue to invest in and grow products
and capabilities as we deliver a superior experience to our clients and we simplify business processes for
colleagues and other business partners. As investors and business partners, you will continue to see the full
capability of this company. Webster's earning power, a strong capital and funding profile, differentiated
commercial businesses, colleague talent and engagement are all attributes that enable Webster to generate peer

leading returns through a variety of operating environments. We'll utilize our strong operating profile and flexible
capital position to continue growing share in our key markets and business segments, allocating our resources to
the highest return opportunities to maximize economic profit, all within a disciplined risk management framework. I
want to thank you all for joining us today.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christopher McGratty with Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for the update, guys. Glenn, on the NII, maybe you could talk through the ranges of
NII, the range of outcomes. Is it more about the Fed? Is it more about competition? And I guess what would it take
at this point for you to take a different view of NII? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, thanks. So, Chris, I think it is primarily driven by increased deposit costs and increased funding costs as a
whole. So that's why we adjusted that range down a little bit. The second part of your question was...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
I'm sorry, Chris. It's combination of our assumption of Fed with one more rate hike and just general deposit
competition. As you see, we see NIM expansion coming off this quarter because of the dynamics in our balance
sheet, but also because of our floating rate loan book and the pace at which we think deposit costs will grow.
Plus, we have some good guys coming in the third and fourth quarter with respect to kind of core commercial
growth, seasonal growth in lower cost government deposits. So, that's kind of what factors in to where we are
with, obviously, the governor being just overall higher deposit and funding costs industry wide.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for that. In terms of just the regulation, you're comfortably below [ph] $100 billion (00:19:22). But
obviously I think the market will expect at some point you will be there. Can you just talk through the expense

angle potentially that you're thinking about and also how your capital targets may evolve and capital return
strategies may evolve? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Chris, it's a great question. And obviously, we're spending a lot of time thinking about it. I think it's too early
to even throw out kind of a wild guess on cost. I think the reality is even if you're at $85 billion, the trickle-down
effect of the way you're regulated, you certainly need to begin being prepared. I actually think our infrastructure
with respect to stress testing and the way we measure liquidity, we've held ourselves to LCR for a long time, even
when we didn't have to, even pre-merger. So, I think we have the infrastructure to deal with whatever regulations
come down. So, I think more than internal costs, right, I think the impact would be – is exactly as you intimated at
the end there, would be higher capital levels, higher liquidity requirements that would have an economic kind of
impact on the bank if we have to hold more liquidity and different types of liquidity and have more capital. But it
would be too early to give you kind of our expectations. We're just following it closely. And as I said, I think
internally, we have the capabilities, the systems, and the people to be able to deal with whatever comes out as it's
phased in over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And the only thing I would add to that, Chris, is you saw my comments on our common equity Tier 1, even
if we were to add in the AFS losses, we'd be at like a 9.4% from 10-plus percent, 10.6%. So, that would probably
be phased in over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And is there any contemplation of a share repurchase given the strength of the balance sheet or is it too
uncertain on the economy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No. I think as we go into it, you may have seen we repurchased $50 million or so of shares to offset grants to
employees and colleagues throughout the organization. We certainly have the capability to do it in the second
half. I think we stick to our normal view that I think we're good stewards of capital. So, we look at internal
opportunities to deploy capital first. We contemplate things like balance sheet restructuring. We look at tuck-in
acquisitions for HSA and other things. But if that's not there and we continue to generate the kind of capital we are
and it looks like the credit environment remains stable, you'd see us absolutely looking at share repurchases, but I
think it's a matter of time and our view of how stable the ultimate credit environment is as we move through the
third and fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right, great. Thanks, John.

Operator: Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is open.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.

Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Glenn, question on the NIM forecast in the back half of the year, that lift of 10 to 15 bps, is that immediate? It feels
like it could be given the borrowing, where the borrowings ended the quarter. It feels like it was back half
weighted. Just some color there. And in the interest, the spot deposit costs and interest-bearing deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So let me hit that. So, yeah, you're right. I mean 12 basis points come back to us. And that's the function of
the balance sheet liquidity plus bringing down balances held with the Fed, which were averaging $3 plus billion in
the second quarter. So, you get that 12 basis points there. You get another 12 basis points – the 5 basis points on
loan impact. So, you have about 2 basis points of NIM coming from the variable book and then another 3 basis
points from the fixed book. So, that's 5 basis points, right?
And in the investment portfolio, same sort of thing. You pick up about 3 basis points there. And then of course,
further deposit repricing. And the thing I'd point out there is it's probably negative, so 6 to 7 basis points, not as
severe as it was first quarter. Second quarter obviously, because we've built up some of the key – the higher cost
products like interLINK and brokered CDs. But yeah, you should begin to see that come back in beginning in the
third quarter significantly.
On the second part of your question, I think our exit cost was on deposits and that's like [ph] 184 bps (00:24:02).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Okay. And then the beta assumption, 40% through first quarter 2024. So, I guess if the Fed is on hold and we're
higher for longer, is that beta – can that 40% beta go higher? And then what is the beta forecast assumed for
DDA mix at 19% of the total deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, a couple of things in there. Our forecast is that the Fed increases next week and stays at 5.50% for the
rest of the year. So, that ties to that 40% that you're seeing on the slide. And so I think that's the first part of your
question. I think there is a lag. There has been a lag on Fed increases and how that's trickled down to the deposit
bases. It's been like a quarter or two for the most part. And that's again why you see some of that acceleration in
the second quarter. I think the second part of your question was on DDA deposits as a percent – as a percent of
total. And for us, if you look at it, I think that fourth quarter of 2022, we were a combined organization 25%, right?
One of the things that's happened here is we have built interLINK and broker, and so that's increased the total
deposit base. So, if you look at that for full year basis, you're probably in a range of 18.5% to 19% by the fourth
quarter. If you were to strip out things like interLINK and broker, you're probably close to 20%, 21%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And Casey, this is John. I think your last – one of your questions in there was, what are your assumptions if –
what happens to beta if the cycle is longer. I think our view is could it tick up a little more, I guess, but that most of
– if they stay flat and higher for longer, that most of the beta and most of the increase would be captured by 1Q.
You could have a little drift up over time, but we think the behavior is moderate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Okay. Got it. That's fair on DDA mix too, on the interLINK growth. Last one for me, just on the capital
management front. Did you guys buy back any shares, as the share count was lower? But I didn't see any
mention of it. And then just any updated thoughts on appetite for buyback activity going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Casey, I just mentioned answering McGratty's question that we did about $50 million of share repurchases
in the quarter to offset grants to employees. So, yes, we did. And I mentioned that we'll have the same sort of
disciplined approach. We are generating capital, a good amount of capital obviously annually and we're slightly
above our CET1 target. So, to the extent we don't have internal opportunities to deploy capital or a really
compelling balance sheet restructuring, we would look – as long as there weren't signs of significant credit
deterioration, we would look to deploy some level of capital and share repurchases as we look to the second half

Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Breese with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe to start, could you just give us some idea of what incremental loan yields are today and assuming they're
higher, how has that impacted originations and pipeline on a month-to-month basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a complex question. While we get the yields – let me start with credit spreads, it could be an interesting
way to start. So, there is no question that I think us, like most of the industry, are being kind of more demanding
and more disciplined in terms of where we're generating loans and how we're generating loans. We have seen
increases in credit spreads. So, if you think of, obviously, the reference rates and SOFR and prime continue to
move up, but we're also seeing a level of expansion.
I was talking to the team yesterday in kind of construction-related CRE, you can get 75 basis points plus with
respect to additional credit spread from [ph] CRE (00:28:25) pre-March. On other sort of more traditional and
predictable CRE outside of office which obviously people aren't doing, it's more like 50 basis points. And then on
C&I, the team's seeing kind of 25 to 50 basis point expansion in credit spreads. So take those credit spreads over
the expanding reference rates. And Glenn can give you the yields.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Matt, the yields on both the quarter-to-date and for the month of June were sort of the mid-7s, right?
So, obviously, it's going to be driven by mix and product mix. But generally, when we look at the quarter and you
look at the months, it's in the mid 7s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And then I was curious on the $80 million in office loans that you divested. I'm just curious how
that process went. How liquid was the market for office loan buyers? What kind of comfort did that give you on
potential loss content on the rest of the office book? And is there any more you're looking to do there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a great question again, and there's not a way to give a kind of definitive quantitative answer. I think
we've clearly seen and as you've seen, I'm really proud of the team. We reduced office exposure by 25% over the
last four quarters with really minimal hit to capital and minimal credit loss.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
There is no question that the amount of liquidity and the eagerness of purchasers in the market for loans is it's
more expensive now than it was four quarters ago, just given kind of people's view of the market. There still is a
lot of liquidity, a lot of private capital, as you know, out there. And so that is encouraging to us in terms of our
ability. If we've picked good pieces of property to finance, at the end of the day, if there is alternative uses for
those properties, or even if there has been a valuation decline, but there is still clearly equity in the property,
we've been able to find buyers. This last quarter, we said that $80 million represented roughly 50% to 60% of our
charge-offs in the quarter. But we think, obviously, with respect to noncritical and strategic office properties, that's
the right move now.
So, it's getting more expensive. I think we'll continue to being proactive. We feel really good about the fact that
we've pared the portfolio thoughtfully and it's now down to below $1.3 billion non-medical office. But there are
buyers of this real estate at a reasonable price still out there, although it's obviously getting more expensive to
execute on kind of balance sheet moves like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then last one for me. In late June, there was some joint interagency guidance from the FDIC, the Fed,
the OCC on prudent commercial real estate loan accommodations and workouts. And I would like your
perspective on how this plays out practically. What does it look like in terms of how you help customers or how
you can help customers, what are the expected tools that can be used? And how will these accommodations and
workouts be disclosed if and when they occur?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, another loaded question that I don't know I can answer with specificity, but I'll give you my perspective.
During. obviously, and – I'm not going to go back to a history lesson, but in the early 1990s, obviously, the
regulators with respect to real estate really killed the banking market and accelerated and were very prescriptive
with respect to the way they looked at restructuring.
During the great financial crisis, when I was Chief Credit Risk Officer here, I thought they were very constructive
in terms of making sure that as long as you were realistic with respect to the return you were getting on the loans,
that they knew it was in everyone's best interest to modify. And we're seeing that general tone and tenor, I think,
from the regulators again, which will be constructive.
So, my view is, and our view at least internally in the bank, is you don't want to artificially kick the can forward if
there's not a reasonable credit to be renewed. And I think the regulators are still going to hold us accountable to
making sure that we're taking appropriate losses. We're recognizing non-accrual loans and that we're not able to
modify things artificially that really aren't good loans.
But so far, we're able to work with our sponsors and real estate owners and either get a little bit of additional
proceeds. And in consideration, we underwrite a slightly higher LTV if the cap rates have changed the value. And
so far on that, we've seen kind of a constructive stance. And I think from our vantage point, that's really helpful,
but it also doesn't give us the opportunity to sort of artificially kick forward a loan that really shouldn't be kicked
forward.
And I think that's the way the analysts and the investors will see it in that if you don't have enough cash flow to
service your loan, you're going to have to take appropriate action and classify and risk rate the loan appropriately.

If you've got cash flowing loans, but it's just going to take longer to repay or you've got a higher LTV, I think we're
going to have some flexibility in being able to work with the borrowers to a good outcome.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I did want to follow up maybe just on the office line of questioning. So, we saw another bank, that just reported,
that sold their medical office portfolio. And it was only like a 2.5% mark. Maybe it was a bit non-core for them.
But I guess could you maybe speak to the puts and takes between maybe keeping even medical office around? Is
that a core kind of product for you? Do you have deposits tied to those borrowers? Is that something where you
just evaluate your overall office exposure, even if it's something like medical office, you might look to kind of exit it
now as opposed to waiting later down the road?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Specifically the medical office, I don't think so. It's such a different animal. Right now, it's still really strong,
vacancies are low, rates have held. And so our portfolio is not particularly big. And right now, it's a profitable
business. And often times and most of the time, we had ancillary revenue either coming from deposit liquidity or
fees or other cash management products. So, I don't think that's in our strategic wheelhouse right now and I don't
think we feel from a credit perspective, it's something we need to do.

Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. I did want to just ask on the available for sale portfolio and I'm sorry if I missed it
in the deck. But do you happen to have what the effective duration of that portfolio is? And then could you tell me
what the assumed conditional prepayment rate you're using in the duration [ph] calculus (00:35:43)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. So, the duration is 3.8 years and the CPR we're using is in the high single digits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then I just want to ask just, the credit seems to be holding up really well, but it seems like last
quarter across the industry, there was a couple of one-offs. This quarter across the industry, there is a couple of
more one-offs. And there is some kind of indication that maybe especially in middle market, maybe you're starting
to see some pressure on borrower balance sheets. How are your conversations with borrowers, particularly in
middle market evolving today? And how are they handling higher interest rates or what are some of the key areas
of pressure that they're identifying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And again I'll try and be brief but give you some insights. I think you're right, I think everybody is surprised
that credit held on so strongly. And you look at our metrics, we're not seeing correlated risk across portfolios.
We're being proactive obviously in office just given the secular dynamics there. I think from a risk rating
perspective if you look across the industry, that was kind of stable. I think probably now the bias is to downside.
So, although as you said, it's really only resulted in kind of one-offs from a loss perspective.
I think most folks in the industry expect there to be a little more bumpy as we go forward in the next several
quarters. And it's probably is to your point that the cumulative impact of debt service, higher interest rates, higher
input costs, inflationary pressures on wage and other input costs into businesses. So, we hear – it's funny, what
we hear mostly from our clients is the same thing. It's about they feel good about demand, they feel good about
their customers' confidence. They're still having trouble finding people to either work in their plants or to work on
their counter of their service company.
But I – no doubt that higher costs, input costs and higher interest rates put more pressure on them. But we're not
seeing much capitulation, Brody. And as I said if you look across all of our different sectors and our geographies,
which we do all the time, to look for any sort of correlated performance, behaviors or risk, we're not really seeing
anything right now. And our charge-offs this quarter at 16 basis points are actually 3 basis points below our five-
year average charge-off rate pre-pandemic. And 60% of those were on proactive office sales. So, it certainly
hasn't shown yet through a lot of the statistics.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then one last one for me and again I apologize if I missed it. I was hopping
from another call. Just on the fee income, I know it's not a huge driver of revenue at this point, but I guess Glenn,
what would cause you to kind of be at the high end or the low end of the guidance? And I think the last time we
talked, we had spoken maybe about commercial swap activity picking up a little bit in the back half of the year. Do
you still feel like that's a possibility?

Hey, Mark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
John, I heard your comments on credit and I know this is relatively small dollars, but you had about a $23 million
uptick in commercial non-mortgage non-accruals this quarter and it looked like 30 day, 89 day delinquencies in
that bucket also went up. Is there anything unique to that bucket or any particular industry that's being
challenged?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No, the delinquencies are mostly administrative. I would say that the two – one was a non-office CRE and one
was a C&I loan. We had a couple of credits that led to that. They were really kind of one-off. I was talking with
Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Risk Officer, who said you try and look for dynamics there and it really was more
idiosyncratic management misstep. So, it happens inflows and outflows and we work at it proactively. But I –
again, I haven't seen anything there that leads to that there is a parade of issues behind either of those credits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Yeah, I mean, Glenn can talk from a technical CECL perspective. I think we're pretty conservative. We've got a
good – we're a top decile among our peer group coverage ratio right now, CECL coverage. We're thoughtful
about the uncertainties in the macro market. A lot of it is driven by the inputs of risk rating dynamics. And the
more you proactively deal with troubled credits, obviously, that helps you in terms of what you have to post going
forward.
My personal view is I'd like to keep a robust coverage ratio, but it's all going to be dependent upon how credit
performs, what the risk migration is like, and how proactive we are on being able to resolve, remedy, get payoffs
or sell criticized and classified assets. Mark, so I would say kind of it's stayed the course. Look at what we have
been doing, think about movements in the portfolio and it's probably similar levels to what you've seen in the last
few quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q

I get this question a lot and I wanted to see how you answer it. What do you make of the argument that if rates
stay higher for even longer, the difference in peak deposit betas between banks should narrow and banks that
have lower betas like yourselves will see a larger increase in deposit rates than some of your peers that already
have higher betas?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
I think it will depend on – by bank, it depends on the composition. And for us, as you know, we have HAS, which
basically has through the cycle beta of 2%. And so that's a differentiator for us. If you looked at our other lines of
businesses between the commercial and the consumer business, [ph] those all (00:43:09) have different betas as
well. So, I think a lot of that – our commercial beta is, I think, 34%. Our consumer beta is 22%. So, I think a lot of
that will be driven by the mix shift and the funding profile of each institution.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Manan, my view would be similar. It's kind of an interesting question you asked because you could think
about that as kind of everybody kind of reversion to the mean. But I do think as Glenn said, it really ultimately is
about your deposit mix and your ability. You saw us drive growth in higher cost deposits in the quarter for a
number of strategic reasons. We have expected growth in the second half of the year in our core commercial
franchise, in our consumer book, in our business banking book, in our government operating deposit book. So,
those will be things that should help us mitigate some of the impact of overall higher deposit cost around. So, I
think you can't make the assumption that everybody ends up in the same place if we're in this situation for a long
period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Very helpful. And did you say 2% through the cycle deposit beta on HSA deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I did. And if you looked at our – I think for the quarter, we said cycle to date beta was 34% on our deposits.
And if you peel that back, HSA cyclization is 2%, consumer is at 22%, commercial is at 34%. And the difference
being the higher beta products that we had in the second quarter, interLINK, broker CDs. And so, that's how you
ladder up to that number. But there is differences within the portfolios and there is differences within the product
sets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And is there any environment in which competitive factors push up the beta on those HSA deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
It's interesting because the customers that are really searching for yield in that product become investors and they
move their balances into investment options. So, when you think about that, we think about our 3 million HSA
accounts, 75% of those are spenders. So, they have relatively small balances of like $450 in account. And so, it's
not as meaningful for them. And the savers have a larger balance like $6,000 or $7,000. But as soon as they get
a little more scale, then they become investors.
And so investors got a lower demand [ph] of product – lower DDA (00:45:47) savings balance and a higher
investment balance. For those that are in that savings category and decide to move to investors, still generally if

you look at their balances at $4,500 to $5,000, are multiples of what the spenders are. And like I said 75% of our

I wanted to start – so first to follow up on the comments around the positive trajectory for NII for the rest of this

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

So, I think on an absolute basis, we're in the quarter on noninterest bearing [ph] of $11.3 million, $11.4 million
(00:46:48), and that will ebb and flow. I mean like John said, we have some municipal funds that have come in,

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
I'm curious on the deposit competition side, it seems like most banks were building liquidity this quarter and it's
really played out, right? We're not seeing that as much for 3Q. So when we look at the competitive environment,
is it easing a bit here in the third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't think the competition is easing. It may be because the Fed has paused and it's been such a big
increase that people who are rate sensitive given – and the banks wanting additional liquidity, it was a perfect
storm in 2Q. So I do think that the pressure on deposit pricing eases, but I'm not sure, Steve. I wouldn't
characterize it as the competition for deposits easing.
So, I think that's kind of why you're seeing most of the folks in the industry take a position that the increase in
deposit costs kind of moderate but continue because, obviously, we all think that deposits are the most valuable
thing. And obviously, we're relying more and relying more on our relationships than just going out and chasing
deposits for rate. But I think competition stays strong, but I think the pressure on pricing moderates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then finally, on the regulatory front, so period end assets are almost $75 billion, right? We're all
waiting for the new regulations for banks above $100 billion to hit. And I know we need to wait for the details. But
John, what's your messaging internally at this point to the team? Are you looking at this saying, okay, we're close
enough, whatever comes out, we're going to work to comply with it now? Or do you feel like you have time to
comply with what comes out? Like how are you viewing it at this stage? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, it's great. It's a good question. I'll reiterate a bit of what I said before and maybe add to it. So, I'm really
happy with our risk infrastructure. Our regulatory relationships right now remain strong. It's always been a real
focus of mine and of the team.
As I mentioned earlier in response to another question, we've already complied with LCR. We obviously – we
stress test internally even though we don't have obligations to disclose externally. And so we feel like – and with
this merger that took us over $50 billion, we are on the path to heightened standards already. So, we've built the
infrastructure, I think, to continue to comply and to continue to execute in whatever the regulatory framework is.
So, when people ask how much additional cost will it be and so on and so forth, I think I feel really good about
where we are from a people, a process, and a system perspective.
The real hit is going to be, if there is one, what are the actual capital and liquidity requirements as we move
forward. I think your point is a good one. As we move from $75 billion to $80 billion to $85 billion, we're clearly
going to have to comply and be ready for whatever is out there. We will likely, when these new regulations are
implemented, have an opportunity and a time to adopt. So, we won't rush. We'll make sure we're compliant, but
we'll get ourselves fully prepared.
So, the way I look at it is I don't feel like we're going to be blindsided and it's going to slow us down significantly.
There'll be – if there are additional capital and liquidity requirements, those will be what they'll be. But on a relative
basis, they'll be for all of our peers and our competition. And I feel good that we'll have time to make sure that we
implement whatever is there.

So, the message to the team, as you said, is keep doing what you're doing, make sure that we're meeting all the
heightened standards as above $50 billion bank and, obviously, get ready for whatever is going forward with
respect to our internal systems, our risk management processes, make sure we have the right people. And I feel
really good about that.

Most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point, but it's that one more follow-up on the fee
income side and I apologize if I missed this, my call cut out for a second there. But just curious what your
expectations are. Obviously, the guidance came down. But in terms of a rebound long term, I mean what does it
take to get back to where you were? And then how does that impact the expense side as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, let me give you – I'll give you at the high level, Dan, and then Glenn can fill in any of the charts. We're a
strong commercial bank with strong relationships and we cross-sell lots of products. And so we really grew our
noninterest income on the backs of our commercial banking relationships.
And so what you saw driving higher levels of noninterest income last year were things like swap fees, syndication
fees, loan fees, equity tag, investment realizations from our sponsor and specialty group. And a lot of that, given
the market dynamics has kind of stopped, obviously, with the higher interest rates, where none of the industry is
selling as much swap business. And then with respect to our business in, particularly, commercial real estate and
sponsor and specialty, where we have more capital market fees, when the kind of [ph] ride (00:52:51) stopped for
a bit in March, we've seen a slowdown.
So, I'm telling you that because I think those would be the dynamics that when we reach a more normalized
environment, which I think we expect to be in fourth quarter or first quarter of next year, but we've been a bit

conservative in our forecast that you've seen in our guidance, we start to drive a lot of those ancillary, Treasury
management fees, FX fees, swap fees, capital markets fees, equity tag investment realization. So, that would be
a driver immediately. But as a management team, you can imagine, we're also focused on making sure that we're
– we, over time, can have a higher percentage of our revenue in fee generating businesses as well. So, that's a
strategic emphasis for us.

Operator: Your next question comes from Bernard Von Gizycki with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
[indiscernible] (00:53:54)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
... [indiscernible] (00:53:54) question – hey. You discussed about $120 million in cost savings post the Sterling
conversion, which is expected by this weekend, as noted. You also mentioned that several back office systems
have already been consolidated and I think the acceleration of your tech plans will lead to further synergies. Can
you just remind us, do some of these cost savings come through this year or is the entire amount for full year
2024? And is the $120 million still the cost savings estimate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, it's a great question. So, let me give you little perspective. So, when we announced the transaction, we
announced about a 10% synergy in cost saves of our combined run rate. That was a combination of FTE
reduction without having our office and corporate real estate space, getting rid of duplicative vendor contracts and
then obviously as you mentioned completion of the conversion, back office efficiency synergies, a combination of
the call centers, some branch consolidation, all of that sort of post conversion. So, obviously, the conversion
being pushed out 15 to 18 months from close, stop some of the realization of that. In the interim, we've also talked
about the fact that when we made our announcement on cost synergies, we didn't have a 6% – 7% wage inflation
rate. We didn't contemplate at the announcement the acquisition of Bend and HSA, the acquisition of interlink,
about $25 million higher in FDIC costs and other general inflationary pressures.
So, I think the way to look at it is we do have opportunities that probably will be realized in 2024 because we're
doing the conversion now and then we're consolidating call centers and we're looking at back office synergies

once we've retired some of the subledgers. So, the remaining cost savings that we're talking about there probably
won't impact 2023 materially, but the reality is you saw us keep our core noninterest expense flat period over
period, which is sort of bucking the trend in the industry. And the general synergies of putting these two banks
together have enabled us to keep our efficiency ratio in the low 40% during a period of time, obviously, when
expenses are getting higher and higher. So, the way we look at it is we benefited from realizing a good amount of
the $120 million target, about 75%, some of that has been offset by additional investments and acquisitions. We
do have opportunities in the back half of 2023 to get more efficient, which will benefit our run rate in 2024. But as
we've said all along, this is really a growth story and we're going to continue to invest in our differentiated
businesses.
And if you look at what Jack and I said, jeez, almost three years ago when we announced the transaction, that
two years into the transaction, we would be posting a high teens ROATC and ROA above 1.4% and an efficiency
ratio in the 40% to 45% range. We posted that at year end 2022. We posted that this morning and we expect to
post that again on 12/31 for the full year. So, we feel like we're delivering the financial results and certainly being
one of the most efficient banks in our peer group, if not the most efficient is helping us do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that color. Maybe just one question on deposits. The interLINK balances reached $4.3 billion,
which is over two quarters. And I believe that's versus your target of about $5 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, I'm just kind of curious, is that still your target? Can you pull further into that? I think on the call earlier, you
mentioned seeing some new opportunities for growth in transactional accounts. Maybe you could just give a little
color on where you see the deposit, like where growth will come maybe in the second half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a good question. So, interLINK was $2.8 billion end of period. interLINK was just under $2.9 billion in
the first quarter. Obviously, we're at $4.2 billion. I think the growth in that will moderate over the next couple of
quarters. So, I'm [indiscernible] (00:58:07) probably in a range of $100 million to $150 million, somewhere around
there, but certainly not the increase that you saw in the second quarter. So, you'll see growth sort of moderate
from that point on. We had a target of $5 billion to $6 billion. So, I think by the fourth quarter, we'll probably be at
or slightly under that target.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Like most of – I was looking for is answered. But as you look at the loan yields, you talked about better spreads.
Do you think that that can still move higher as we go through the year if the Fed moves as expected?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, we do. Obviously, we'll get – if we get another rate increase, the reference rates will slide up a bit. But from
a credit spread perspective, I think my base case would be that we do. The dynamics are interesting and people
are choosing to play in different sectors and different asset classes. And loan demand is sort of unpredictable. It's
slower in a bunch of areas and there is some decent demand that we expect in the back half of the year. So, I
think us and the rest of the industry will continue to be thoughtful about deploying capital and making sure that
we're getting paid for risk. So, I expect that credit spread and structure from a bank's perspective, from the
lenders' perspective will continue to modestly improve as we go into the second half, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, Jared, is 60% of our book is floating or periodic. And so I think in the
quarter, we ended at like 6% or 6% yield on the book. And so as you look out, again, we're assuming 25 basis
points at the Fed next week. So, you're probably adding a couple of basis points in the third quarter, couple in the
fourth quarter of the loan – for the total book.
