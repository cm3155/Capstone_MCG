Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Greetings and welcome to The PNC Financial Services Group's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow
the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Gill. Thank you, Bryan. You may begin.

Bryan K. Gill
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill,
the Director of Investor Relations for PNC. And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill
Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor
Relations. These statements speak only as of July 16, 2024 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter and we
generated $1.5 billion in net income or $3.39 diluted earnings per share. Our results included a gain on a portion
of our Visa Class B shares, which was substantially offset by other items in the quarter, including a securities
repositioning. Rob's going to provide more details on that Visa gain, financial results and outlook in a second, but
I'll highlight a few items.
First off, net interest income has moved past its trough, and both NII and NIM grew in the quarter. And by the
way, this would have occurred independent of the $10 million impact that we got from the securities repositioning.
Importantly, we are on a growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. We continue to add new
customers and see strong business momentum across our franchise, particularly in the new and expansion
markets. DDA growth accelerated in our branches, and we continue to add new corporate and commercial
banking clients above historical rates.
In our retail business, we launched our first new credit card in several years, PNC Cash Unlimited, a highly
competitive card that offers 2% back on all purchases. We plan to launch several new cards in the months and
year ahead. Average deposits held relatively flat to the first quarter levels, a little bit ahead of our expectations.
And our expenses remained well-controlled, and we generated positive operating leverage during the second
quarter. Rob's going to touch on this in a minute, but we have increased our continuous improvement program
target for 2024 as expense discipline remains a top priority.
The credit environment continues to play out as we've expected, including an increase in charge-offs within the
CRE office portfolio, where we remain adequately reserved. Outside of CRE office, credit quality remains

relatively stable. Finally, we further strengthened our capital levels during the quarter. Our strong balance sheet
allows us to continue supporting our customers and communities, investing in our business and people, and
delivering returns for shareholders.
Our financial strength and stability are also reflected in the latest results from the Fed's stress test in which we
maintained our stress capital buffer at the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. And importantly, for the second year in a
row, PNC has had the lowest start-to-trough capital depletion in our peer group, further demonstrating our best-in-
class resiliency. With this in mind, our board recently approved an increase in quarterly stock dividend by $0.05.
In summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are well-positioned to drive further growth and
expansion into 2025 and beyond.
Before I turn it over to Rob, as always, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company
and our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?

Robert Q. Reilly
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average linked
quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable, investment securities increased $6 billion or 4%, and our cash
balances at the Federal Reserve were $41 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 15%, primarily reflecting the
deployment of cash into higher yielding securities. Deposit balances averaged $417 billion, a decline of $3 billion
or less than 1% due to a seasonal decline in corporate balances.
Borrowed funds increased $2 billion or 2% and were 15% of total liabilities. At quarter-end, AOCI was negative
$7.4 billion and improved $600 million compared with March 31. Our tangible book value increased to $89.12 per
common share, a 4% increase linked quarter and a 15% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We
remain well-capitalized and our estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% as of June 30.
Regarding the Basel III Endgame, we expect the inclusion of AOCI in the final rule and our CET1 ratio with the
impact of AOCI would be 8.7%. And while we recognize the likelihood of changes to certain other aspects of the
Basel III Endgame NPR, under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-
based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.4%.
We continue to be well-positioned with capital flexibility. We returned roughly $700 million of capital to
shareholders during the quarter, which included $600 million in common dividends and $100 million of share
repurchases. And as Bill just mentioned, our board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash
dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.60 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscored the
strength of our balance sheet, and as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer remains at the
regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the four-quarter period beginning in October 2024.
Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the first quarter, average loan balances were stable.
Commercial loans were essentially flat, as utilization remains well below both the pre-pandemic historical average
of roughly 55% and the second quarter 2023 level of 52.5%. Importantly, we continue to grow customer
relationships and C&IB loan commitments increased during the second quarter.
Although the direction of the near-term economy remains uncertain, CapEx to sales levels and inventory growth
rates remain below historical averages, both of which are typically leading indicators of eventual commercial loan
growth. Average consumer loans declined approximately $600 million or less than 1%, driven by lower residential

real estate and home equity loan balances. And the yield on total loans increased 4 basis points to 6.05% in the
second quarter.
Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion
increased $6 billion or 4%, reflecting the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding securities, primarily
US Treasuries. The securities portfolio yield increased 22 basis points to 2.84%, driven by higher rates on new
purchases. As of June 30, the securities portfolio duration was 3.5 years.
During the second quarter, our forward starting swaps increased to $18 billion. With the addition of these swaps,
we've locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing through 2025 at a level that is approximately 300 basis
points higher than maturities. The total weighted average receive fixed rate of our swap portfolio, including the
forward starters, increased 83 basis points to 3.13% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.2 years.
Slide 7 highlights the securities repositioning we executed during the second quarter. We sold securities with a
book value of $4.3 billion and a market value of $3.8 billion. We recognized a $497 million loss on the sale and
reinvested the $3.8 billion of proceeds into securities with yields approximately 400 basis points higher than the
securities sold. The repositioning is expected to benefit our net interest income by $80 million in 2024, with
roughly $10 million of that being realized in the second quarter. And the estimated earn-back period for this
transaction is less than 4 years.
Turning to slide 8, we expect considerable runoff of low-yielding securities and swaps through the end of 2026,
which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest
income. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved to negative $7.4 billion on June 30 compared to
negative $8 billion on March 31. The improvement was primarily due to the securities repositioning. AOCI will
continue to accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in further growth to tangible book value.
Slide 9 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits declined $3 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower
corporate balances. Regarding mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 23% of total deposits in the
second quarter, down less than 1 percentage point from the first quarter. Additionally, average noninterest-
bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline in the second quarter of 2024 since the Fed began raising rates
in 2022, which gives us confidence that the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. And
our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased by only 1 basis point during the second quarter to 2.61%. We
believe our rate paid on deposits is approaching its peak level. But we do expect some potential drift higher as
interest rates remain elevated.
Turning to the income statement, and as Bill mentioned, there were several significant items in the quarter, and I
want to provide a bit more detail. Taken together, these significant items have a minimal impact to our earnings
per share, totaling to a net EPS benefit of $0.09. As we previously disclosed, we participated in the Visa
exchange program, allowing us to monetize 50% of our Visa Class B-1 shares and convert our remaining
holdings to 1.8 million Visa Class B-2 shares. Through the exchange, we recognized a $754 million pre-tax gain.
In addition, we had significant items that occurred in the second quarter that largely offset the gain, and they are
as follows. First, as I mentioned earlier, we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio, and through the sale
of certain low-yielding securities, recognized a $497 million loss. Second, we recorded a negative $116 million
Visa derivative fair value adjustment associated with Visa Class B-2 shares, primarily related to the extension of
anticipated litigation resolution. And lastly, we recognized a $120 million PNC Foundation contribution expense.
The foundation supports our communities in early childhood education.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Turning to slide 11, we highlight our income statement trends. Second quarter net income was $1.5 billion or
$3.39 per share. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $266 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Net interest income grew by $38 million or 1% in the second quarter. Notably, this is the first time NII has
increased in six quarters, marking the beginning of an expected upward trajectory. And our net interest margin
was 2.6%, an increase of 3 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $228 million, or 12%, and included $141 million of the significant items I previously
detailed. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $23 million, or 1%, and included the $120 million
foundation contribution expense. Notably, we generated positive operating leverage in both the linked quarter and
year-over-year comparisons. Provision was $235 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity, and our
effective tax rate was 18.8%.
Turning to slide 12, we highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was up $266 million or 5%, driven
by higher noninterest income and net interest income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $38 million, or
1%, driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $31 million, or
2%, linked quarter.
Looking at the detail. Asset management and brokerage noninterest income was stable linked quarter, as the
benefit of higher average equity markets was offset by lower annuity sales due to the elevated first quarter
activity. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $13 million, or 5%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity
and loan syndications, partially offset by lower underwriting fees.
Card and cash management increased $35 million, or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction
volumes and higher treasury management fees. Mortgage revenue declined $16 million, or 11%, primarily due to
lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $332 million increased $197 million and included
$141 million related to this quarter's significant items.
Turning to slide 13. Our noninterest expense of $3.4 billion was well controlled, increasing by only $23 million, or
1%. Expenses for the second quarter included the $120 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, while the first
quarter of 2024 included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, noninterest expense, excluding the
foundation contribution, declined $135 million, or 4%, compared with the second quarter of 2023. Notably,
personnel declined as a result of the workforce reduction actions we took last year.
As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. At the beginning of the year, we set
a continuous improvement program goal of $425 million. Recently, we have identified initiatives that support
increasing our CIP by an additional $25 million, raising our full year target to $450 million. As you know, this
program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 14. Nonperforming loans increased $123 million, or 5%, linked quarter,
primarily driven by an individual secured loan within our asset-based lending business. Total delinquencies of
$1.3 billion were stable with March 31. Net loan charge-offs were $262 million in the second quarter and included
$106 million of net charge-offs related to our CRE office portfolio. And our annualized net charge-offs to average
loans ratio was 33 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on June
30, stable with March 31.
Slide 15 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. CRE office NPLs were stable in the second
quarter, as charge-offs and paydowns offset inflows to nonperforming loans. And the migration of criticized loans
to nonperforming status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the challenges inherent to this portfolio. As

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
expected, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio increased and totaled $106 million in the second
quarter.
Ultimately, we expect additional charge-offs on this portfolio, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given
the nature of the loans. As of June 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 10.3% of total office loans, and
inside of that, 15.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Accordingly, we believe we're adequately reserved. Importantly,
we continue to manage our exposure down, and as a result, our balances declined 4% or approximately $300
million linked quarter.
In summary, PNC posted a solid second quarter 2024, and we're well positioned for the second half of the year.
Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the
year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to increase modestly to
slightly above 4% by year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates two times in 2024 with a 25-basis-point decrease
in September and another in December.
Looking at the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be
stable; net interest income to be up 1% to 2%; fee income to be up 1% to 2%; other noninterest income to be in
the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa and securities activity. We expect core noninterest
expense to be up 3% to 4%. We expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Regarding our full year guidance, for ease of comparability to prior guidance, we exclude the first quarter FDIC
special assessment as well as the second quarter Visa gain and other significant items. Considering our reported
first half operating results, third quarter expectations and current economic forecast, our full year 2024 guidance is
as follows.
For the full year 2024 compared to full year 2023, we expect average loans to be down less than 1%, which
equates to nominal loan growth in the second half of 2024. We recognize the potential for greater loan growth,
and should that occur, it'll be accretive to our full year average. Despite lower expected loan volumes, we expect
full year NII to be at the better end of our previous expectations or down approximately 4%. We expect our
securities repositioning and better-than-expected deposit dynamics to offset the impact of the lower-than-
expected loan volume.
We expect noninterest income to be up 3% to 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to continued
softness in mortgage activity, and to a lesser extent, loan-related capital markets fees. As a result, total revenue is
expected to be down 1% to 2% and inside the range of our previous guidance. We now expect core noninterest
expense to be down approximately 1% versus our previous guidance of stable, in part due to our increased CIP
target. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Hi. Good morning.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, on NII, I know you guided to the upper end of the range, even though you've got slower loan growth, clearly
due to your NIM improving. At least that's one driver. There's others as well. I just wanted to understand how
you're thinking about the securities restructuring from here. Is this something that you would consider continuing
or is it – we should look at it as a one-off from using the Visa gains? And I ask just from the context of trying to
think through NIM trajectory from here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You should think of it as a one-off. I mean, you never say never, and I don't know what the future holds. But
practically, at this point, we don't have to do any restructuring on anything to hit that stated goal of the 2025
record NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And we don't have any plans to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then, could you speak to how you're thinking about deposit pricing and levels? I mean, clearly,
there was tax-related outflows and things like that this quarter. And with loan growth being muted, should we be
anticipating deposits stable to down or are you going to out there trying to get deposit growth? Just again asking
from the context of how we should think about deposit pricing as we work through our models. Thanks so much.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Yeah, sure. Sure, Betsy. I would say the short answer to that is stable to down is our expectation with an
emphasis on stable. Things have really stabilized year-over-year, as you know. So, our expectation is some
downward drift, but not anywhere near the level that we've seen in the last couple of years.

Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On your NII outlook, it's good to hear the NII inflection and the confidence there. Excluding the $70 million benefit
from the securities repositioning in the back half of this year, I mean, it appears that the underlying NII run rate for
the back half was guided a bit lower. Is that mainly loan growth that's the driver? I mean, if you could just talk
through that a little bit in terms of the factors impacting that run rate.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It wasn't – if you backed out the restructuring, that would still be higher, and we did that while muting our loan
growth assumption. And we did that because we kind of just got tired of saying that, hey, loan growth is going to
come at some point. So, we took it out of the forecast. If it shows up, we'll benefit like everybody else.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And I think that's an important point. That's the big difference in this quarter. We changed our guidance for
average loans to be up 1% – or approximately 1% for the year, John, to as you can see now, down less than 1%.
We don't control that. There's a basis for some loan growth in the second half of the year. But the important point
is we've taken it out of our guidance, and our NII improves to the better end of the previous guidance, not just due
to the securities restructuring, but also the positive deposit dynamics and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. No, thanks for the clarification. That helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And then, just separately on the capital – on the capital front, clearly, the AOCI benefit from the securities
repositioning is certainly noted. How does that – how do you feel now in terms of the pace of buybacks as you
look out, just given where you stand now on CET1 and from a fully phased-in? How does that make you feel
about the pace of buybacks here? Could it remain at the $100 million pace per quarter or possibly accelerate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, right now, we're on pace and we continue to – we expect to continue the pace that we've been on
for the first couple of quarters. And as you know, the new rules are still in flux. So, there's not finalization there.
And then, beyond that, I think a driver will be what happens with loan growth, which would be a factor in terms of
that being our highest and best use of our capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But that'll be a factor in terms of deciding on buybacks. But the important part is that we are buying back shares.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think, John, just on buybacks, I mean, at some point, I got to believe loan growth comes back. But to the
extent it doesn't, we're generating a lot of capital, obviously in excess of our dividend. And we'll face that question
if we're not using that capital for loan growth, should we accelerate deployment and buybacks. We're not there
yet, but that happens down the road if loan growth doesn't materialize, because we're generating a lot of capital.

Good morning. Going back to slide 9, I presume that the stabilization in deposit rate paid, which is quite notable

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Our plan – so, slide 9 is a good slide and it clearly shows a decline in the increase of the rate paid.
The short answer to one of your questions there is we do expect the rates paid to drift up a little bit, but in contrast
– more like a handful of basis points versus the contrast to the previous quarters where you see 60 basis points or
50 basis points and even 30 basis points in the recent quarters. So, it's slowed down considerably. That's our
expectation in the short-term, Erika. When we get into rate cuts, we'll see. We'll be able to move pretty quickly on

the high rates paid on commercial and wealth. But we still do have these interest-bearing consumer deposits that
are below market that will grind higher. So, that's something that we've talked about before and just something
that we'll need to keep our eye on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question refers back to slide 6 in terms of the forward starters. When I look back at your
10-Q disclosure, it seems like you're largely neutral to interest rates. And I know that you and Bill have talked a lot
about the different factors that drive the inflection point in the Nike Swoosh. I'm wondering if the addition of the...

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...$18 billion in forward starters with the receive fixed of 4.31%, does that impact the magnitude of the Swoosh for
2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's a good question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, my answer to that would not necessarily be the magnitude, but the certainty.

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, probably 50 basis points ago. One of the issues, of course, when everybody talks about fixed rate asset
repricing is what is it repriced to. And of course, therefore, we are exposed to whatever that five-year rate is a
year and two out. And those forward starting swaps simply, at a very opportunistic point, locked in materially
higher rates than where we are today. To Rob's point, that just locks in the certainty of what we'll be able to
produce on a go-forward basis.

No. Got it. And then, Bill, I think that's such a good point, because I think when people are thinking of fixed asset
repricing, sometimes they misthink about the 5.25% as opposed to, whatever. It could be at 4%, right, by the end
of next year, and to that – to your point...

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, I was hoping you could maybe touch on sort of
major fee components in light of the softer expectation. I mean, it sounds like it's just a – or mostly a function of
mortgage, which sort of is what it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
But just curious to hear sort of what do you think is going well, what will need heavier lift, that kind of thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. It's mostly a refinement, Scott. So, for the full year guide around the fees, we lowered our expectations of
increase, as you know, from up 4% to 6% to up 3% to 5%. So, still up and a small shift, most of that coming from
continued softness in mortgage, which we expect to be on the – continue in the balance half or second half of the
year, little bit less than what we were expecting. To a lesser extent, tied to the reduced loan guidance. We do
have loan-related fees within our capital markets segment, think loan syndication. So, generally speaking, if
there's fewer loans, there'll be fewer loan syndication fees. So, that's just a direct correlation there to that guide.
And again, we could see loan growth. And if that's the case, then those fees would come back. But that's the
general thinking. Everything else on schedule, so to speak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Rob. And then, I wanted to ask a little bit of a kind of fine-pointed one on loan growth. I
think, Bill, in your sort of prepared remarks, you noted the introduction of your first new credit card in a while, as
well as plans to introduce more.

some point next year in terms of what the normalized rate would be? And can we get to a 3%-plus NIM next year,

Sure. So, we don't necessarily provide NIM guidance because it's more an outcome than anything. But to answer
your question, we've operated in, call it, a normal environment at a 3% NIM margin. So, if we – we definitely
expect to go up into 2025, if we approach those levels, it won't be like we haven't been there before. So, it's
reasonable.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, when we take a look at our total reserves and our total portfolio, CRE office aside, things are pretty
stable. Maybe on quarter-to-quarter basis, consumer is a little bit better, commercial non-CRE is a little bit worse,
but not bad. So, definitely, some more movements, some downgrades reflecting the higher rates, slower
economic activity in our commercial book, but no patterns or any themes to point out.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Following up on your NIM and NII commentary, is there a point, as we start to get cuts, where you would start to
worry that those rate cuts would potentially begin to negate some of the repricing benefit? And then, separately,
amid the debate over whether the curve's going to steepen or flatten depending on the outcome of the election.
Maybe could you just give us a little bit of a perspective on how PNC is positioned for either a flatter or a steeper
yield curve environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. We're largely indifferent. I mean, at the very, very margin, we benefit on the Fed cut rates from a floating
rate standpoint. Of course, we're exposed to the steepness of the curve, because that plays into how we reprice
maturing fixed rate assets. And that's a variable, it's a variable for us, it's a variable for everybody. It's one of the
reasons we locked some of it in. My own belief and our positioning is such that even though we would expect the
Fed to cut here, I think, in the end, somewhat sticky inflation, the fact that deficits matter is going to cause the
curve to steepen out. So, we locked some of it in. I don't feel terribly worried about the need to lock the rest of it
in. I don't know, but I just think we're in a good place. We're going to do fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the asset quality side, slide 14 shows that steady upward trajectory in NPLs,
but the reserve rate is relatively stable to down slightly, as you mentioned. And so, it looks like the loss content
that you see in the portfolio is stable. It's certainly not rising, despite the rising NPLs. Maybe could you speak a
little bit to that. And are there any implications of loan repricing that you are concerned about? For example,
would you expect any impact on the credit performance of your customers as their loans begin to reset to higher
rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, just quickly, the movement, particularly in office CRE, right, from criticized to nonperforming, related
reserving and charge-offs is all going as we've expected. That's the natural progression of that cycle. Nothing's
changed. We're not surprised by anything. We're reserved for it.
Credit quality of Corporate America as it relates to at what point do the people who have locked in fixed rates at
low rates start to have to pay more. Ultimately, the margin is going to impact the way we rate somebody. I think
about multifamily as an example where higher rates have hurt coverage ratios. It's not going to cause losses, but
it's caused us to downgrade that asset class simply because the excess isn't there. And I think that'll flow through
to Corporate America over a period of time as well. But I'm not particularly worried about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And I'd just add that our reserves are adequate. The increase in the non-CRE NPLs in commercial really was one
single large credit, that is in our business credit fully secured loans. So...

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. Thanks, Bill and Rob. Bill, if I could squeeze in one last one for you, I wanted to get your thoughts on
the FedNow instant payment services, which has been getting some attention. Is there a fee opportunity there? I
guess, what level of engagement are you seeing from PNC customers? Do you see potential for lower cost,
instant digital payments disintermediating debit? It would just be helpful to hear your thoughts on the overall risk
versus potential benefits of that to PNC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't think FedNow has any impact on PNC, to be honest with you. We've been active with real-time payments
in The Clearing House and the use cases – all the ones you can think about from insurers who want to pay real-
time claims in a disaster through to certain payroll capabilities, through to Zelle, for example. And FedNow doesn't
add or subtract anything to that opportunity.
The challenge you have with real-time payments both at The Clearing House and FedNow at the Fed is they are
not networks. They are a rail to move money. And the distinction between that is a network has very clear rules
on who's responsible for items that don't transmit the right way, who's responsible for fraud, who's responsible for
returns, on and on and on. And neither of those two networks purposefully were built – or sorry, neither of those
two payment rails purposefully were built [indiscernible] (00:40:34) purposefully for moving money [indiscernible]
(00:40:40). So I don't think long term it has much of an impact, to be honest with you.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...great table last December with the repricing of fixed assets through 2025. And I'm just wondering, how much
carry-forward will there also be through 2026? Should we think about that kind of ratably? And obviously, it's been
six months since you gave us that slide. But just wondering just how that rolls as we look further ahead. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, Ken, we're going to refrain from 2026 guidance on the call here today. But it'll continue to increase. But the
real change in the dynamic occurs, obviously, in that first and second quarter of 2025 and then grows from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And then, on the expenses, so you guys have been doing a great job holding the line. And I
just wanted to ask, like it looks like there's a pretty decent ramp baked into the second half on expenses, and I'm
just wondering like what influences that, because it seems like expenses will be growing faster than revenues in
the second half, so – or certainly faster than fees. So, could you just walk through, is that conservatism, there's
some catch-up on investments that you're making, any context on that? Thanks, Rob.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, sure. No, we've outperformed on the first half, no doubt about it, and we feel great about that. And
that's one of the reasons why we increased our CIP goal and also increased our guidance for the full year
expenses. In the third quarter – it doesn't all happen uniformly. In the third quarter, we do have some investments
coming online, technology investments coming online that bring some depreciation expense. We've got an
additional day, those sorts of things. So, it's all part of the plan. It's just expenses don't fall uniformly throughout
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. And then, obviously, as that plays forward, and if NII is better next year, you can also afford more
cost growth, but we'll hear about that later?

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Similar to some of the others, maybe this is like the game of Jeopardy! I think the answer is you have
continued improvement program with expense savings going from $425 million up to $450 million. You have
securities repositioning that's giving you a boost to NII for the rest of this year, and you have fixed asset repricing
that helps your securities yield go up by 400 basis points, your forward payment swaps go up by 180 basis points
and a little bit some other things. So, the answer is all those things are going in the right direction. Yet, you still
have a guide for negative operating leverage for this year. So, I guess, what is the question or why is that? Or you
can't eke it out or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Yeah. So, what's going – Bill, you were very adamant three quarters ago about loan growth. And look, if you get
NII in your range even without getting loan growth, I think people would rather take that than not. But we're
hearing all the capital – the biggest capital market players are just gushing with their expectations that this is a big
capital markets recovery, the world's back, everything else. H.8 data actually showed a little bit better. I think you
might have underperformed the H.8 data this quarter on loan growth. So, is it, A, that you're just being more
prudent and conservative and you're not seeing the pricing that you want? Or B, your mix is just a little bit
differently? Or C, maybe your team's not executing quite as well as you'd like them to do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think you're trying to read into this too hard. Look, we're basically on H.8, maybe a little soft on consumer
because our card book didn't grow. When C&I comes back, traditionally, we'll do better. We've been actually
adding DHE. They're just not drawing it. We're winning clients. All we did, Mike, was this whole notion of if we're
giving guidance on the expectation and some crystal ball that says there is going to be loan growth when thus far
we don't see evidence of it, we just took it out.
If it shows up, then it's additive to everything we do. And we certainly aren't underperforming. We're winning
clients at a pace that we never have. So, it's literally this notion of when do they draw on lines and we just – we
got tired of talking about it. When they do it, we'll benefit and it'll add to all of those numbers that you're looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And any meat on those bones about customer acquisition? You did mention 51% loan utilization. That seems a
pretty low level versus 53% a year ago and 55% historical.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, we've grown exposures and we've won clients at a pace well beyond – particularly in the new markets,
but overall well beyond what we've managed to do historically. We ought to and we will produce some of those
metrics for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's all good. I'd just add to that, Mike, CapEx to sales – as we said in our opening comments, CapEx
to sales ratios are low, inventory levels are low. So, there's just – there's a lot pointing to loan growth. It's just we
don't control it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just the last follow-up on that because, Bill, you've been around for a while and Rob, the disconnect between
what we're hearing and seeing in the capital markets, and that activity picking up versus the still subdued loan
growth, as you say, CapEx, inventory are lower, just seems CEO confidence is up, people are ready to do all
sorts of things. Yet, when the rubber meets the road with you guys, you're just not seeing it that much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. You're trying to isolate us, and we're not isolated. I would happily tell you loan growth is going to be 2%,
which is what all our peers are going to say. And if they hit 2%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We don't know that, right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
If we hit 2% – or sorry, if they hit 2%, then we'll hit 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Or maybe a little better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't see anything suggesting that's going to happen. So, maybe – I mean, what would you rather have us do
here, put in our forecast a we-hope-this-happens number or just give you numbers that we know are going to
happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
No, I understand. Under-promise and over-deliver, it's what we try to do. It's just, in the past, you said, at this
stage of the cycle and historically, you've seen loan growth come back. So, it sounds like...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...this cycle might be – it might be a little bit different, might not be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think – I've spent a lot of time pondering this, Mike. I don't – look, at the margin, it's got to be that the cost
of holding inventory, right, just the cost of that drawn revolver is big time on the radar of corporates who are
managing their own profitability. If you can run with lower inventory, your interest rates go way down when Fed
funds is 5.25%. So, I think that's part of it. I think this whole uncertainty, as we come up into the election, on
what's it going to look like from a regulatory basis, what am I allowed to invest in, am I going to get it approved, all
of that, there's a lot of pent-up energy behind that, and we'll see. But I don't know, and it literally was this thing of
rather than keep guessing and wishing, if it happens, it's a great outcome. But we don't need to rely on it.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Bill, I haven't heard you guys talk too much about credit card, and you mentioned a new product
and some more coming. Just thoughts on kind of the strategy for card going forward and the targeted customer
and then any interest in acquiring portfolios, which has not really been on the radar in the past. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, we're not going to acquire portfolios. The product that we have historically offered our existing clients
and the service levels, websites, processing that went along with it were less than what we aspire to. We have an
ability to get higher penetration with our existing clients, offer them better products, have better technology.
Historically, we prioritized tech investments inside of our core retail space, so think online, mobile, real time, and
we just haven't put the same energy, although about a year ago, we started to into what we do in credit card.
Some of that is service technology, ease for customers, application, all of that stuff. Some of it is just getting
better at approvals. And we're not going to change our credit box, but we're missing a lot of clients who are in that
credit box because we make it too hard for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Or in simple terms, we're just underpenetrated relative to industry averages, nothing hugely aspirational
other than just to have our fair share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. That makes sense. And then, just separately, I think you still have half of your original Visa stake, and
what's kind of the plan on that? And I assume that's in the [ph] $750 million (00:51:56) range mark-to-market for
Visa, net of hedges and stuff like that. But just frame what's left and the timing of it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm sorry, I missed the front part of that question.

Visa. Visa [indiscernible] (00:52:09)

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, what happens with the back half, so the 50% that we did not have the ability to monetize? Well, Visa controls
that schedule. Some of it's reliant on the litigation resolution and some of it's reliant on the schedule they've laid
out, which is sort of a multi-year exchange. So, we'll just continue to monitor it.

Please proceed with your questions.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Bill. Hi, Rob.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
So, you guys have a good fortune of having insights into the commercial real estate business through Midland,
your CMBS servicer. Can you give us some insights and color on what Midland is seeing in terms of their pipeline
of increased special servicing, which of course I know has higher revenue, but more importantly, maybe
directionally shows us where credit is heading?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good question, Gerard. Ironically, their special servicing balances actually went down in the
quarter, which is a little bit of a head-scratcher. We don't think that's necessarily indicative of a trend. We do
expect it to continue to go up. But from the start – and I think you've asked this question before – it's been much,
much slower in terms of those increases of the balances than you would have expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And I went through forecast on sort of expectations on maturity bubbles and property types. And we don't
expect that balance – it's not going to grow at the pace that intuitively, you might have thought of a year ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You would have thought, yeah, and that we thought a year ago.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Because [ph] if things aren't getting cured (00:54:00), they're getting sold off pretty quickly. For
things that are really bad, there's still a lot of capital in the market. So, they're turning it faster than perhaps we
would have thought.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Are they seeing any change in the product? Is it still primarily commercial office or is it moving into any other
product areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's mostly office.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Okay. Yeah?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. It's interesting. It's all of the above for all of the historical reasons.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, there's still a little retail. There's hotels that'll show up in there. There's multifamily that is in the multifamily that
went to Freddie, Fannie, and then increasingly, it's office and the bubble down the road looks more like office.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

you along in analyzing or reviewing that portfolio? Are you completely through it and now it's going a second time
or any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, we're
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, we've analyzed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, we're completely through it every quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, a couple of things. I don't know if we put this out there. But there's actually not that many loans. So, we
don't have thousands of small loans. These are typically larger loans. And so, we've gone asset by asset, and as
anything gets close to being troubled, we look at three different appraisals, one of which is our own, self-
generated, using more extreme negative assumptions than what you might get from a commercial appraiser. We
use higher vacancy rates, higher interest rates, longer time to lease up, higher cost to rehab, all that other stuff in
our evaluation. So, we go through this, we know all the properties, we keep looking at them, we know what's
going to happen to them, we know the timelines. Look, it's not a great outcome, but there's nothing in there that I
think is going to surprise us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And just one last one on this, Bill. Geographically, are you guys finding certain parts of the country
weaker than others? I know there's a lot of talk about the big urban markets, Class B and C buildings. How about
from your vantage point, what do you guys seeing geographically?

William Stanton Demchak A
