Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Amid the ongoing public
health crisis, I hope you and your families are healthy and well.
At Northern Trust, we continue to operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we are focused on
providing our clients continuity of service while the majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely.
Before turning the call over to Jason to walk through the financials in detail, I wanted to offer some brief
comments on our performance for the quarter. Our results for the quarter resulted in earnings per share growth of

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
9% versus the prior year and a return on average common equity of 13.7%. Revenue was consistent with the
prior year as declines in net interest income and trading-related revenue were offset by 6% growth in trust fees.
The persistent low interest rate environment has pressured our net interest income as well as our trust fees as
reflected by money market fee waivers. While overall year-over-year operating leverage was negative, the 6%
growth in trustees did produce 1 point of positive fee operating leverage despite the impact of fee waivers which
reduced our trust fee growth versus the prior year by five percentage points.
The current quarter's results also benefited from an improved economic outlook which drove a $30 million release
of reserves for credit losses. Throughout the past year, our strong capital base and liquidity profile enabled us to
support the needs of our clients and this was demonstrated further during the first quarter as we saw 10%
sequential growth in average total deposits and 3% sequential growth in average loan balances.
Throughout this challenging environment, we have effectively executed on initiatives to continue to drive organic
growth within each of our businesses, one of our key strategic initiatives. Within wealth management, our digital
marketing efforts in Northern Trust Institute have driven more conversations and engagement and we've
experienced an increase in client engagement during the quarter. Within asset management, we have continued
to see success and growth within ESG mandates with assets under management of $139 billion at quarter end,
and our quant active strategies have experienced strong relative performance providing us good momentum.
In our asset servicing business, we continued to see organic growth during the quarter with the success being
well-diversified across regions, products, and client segments. Moving forward, we remain focused on continuing
to effectively navigate through the persistent low interest rate environment focusing on driving greater efficiencies
as well as continuing to grow organically in a scalable and profitable manner.
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees whose commitment, expertise, and
professionalism throughout these extraordinary times continues to be exceptional.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's dive
into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of
$375.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.70. And our return on average common equity was 13.7%. You can
see on the bottom of page 2 equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of
our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels in both the S&P 500 and EAFE Local had strong
sequential performance based on those calculations. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-
month LIBOR rates were stable during the quarter with modest declines.
Move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue is flat with
noninterest income up 5% and net interest income down 17%. Expenses increased 5% while net income was up
4%. In the sequential comparison, revenue grew 4% with noninterest income up 5% and net interest income up
slightly. Expenses declined 3% and net income increased 56%. Recall that the prior quarter included $66.9 million
in expense relating to severance and occupancy charges. Excluding those charges, expenses were up 3% on a
sequential basis.

The provisions for credit losses reflected a release of $30 million in reserves in the quarter compared to our
provision of $61 million in the prior year and a release of $2.5 million in the prior quarter. The release in the
quarter was driven by continued improvement in the projected economic conditions and portfolio credit quality
relative to the prior quarter.
The return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from 13.4% a year ago and 8.8% in the prior
quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $14.8 trillion grew 36% from a year ago and increased 2% on
a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $11.5 trillion grew 40% from a year ago and increased 2% on a
sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, up 29% from a year ago and up 3% on a
sequential basis.
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable
equivalent basis is $1.6 billion, flat with the prior year and up 4% sequentially. Trust, investment, and other
servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were up 6% from last
year and 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $79 million in the quarter, down 12% year-over-
year and up 15% sequentially. The decline compared to a year ago was driven by lower volume and lower
volatility while the sequential performance was driven by higher volume.
The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $101 million in the quarter, up 16% compared to a year
ago and up 9% sequentially. Within this, securities, commissions, and trading income declined 17% compared to
a year ago but was up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflected lower interest rate swap and
transition management activity. The sequential performance was driven by strong growth within our core
brokerage business, which includes our integrated trading solutions product.
Other operating income totaled $55 million and was up 60% from one year ago and up 11% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth was impacted by higher income in the supplemental compensation plans and a prior-year
market value adjustment for a seed capital investment, partially offset by higher expense relating to Visa swap
agreements.
The growth to the supplemental compensation plans had a related increase within our other operating expense.
The sequential increase was primarily associated with lower expense relating to Visa swap agreements. Net
interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later was $347 million in the first quarter, down 17% from a year
ago and up slightly on a sequential basis.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional
Services business fees totaled $621 million in the first quarter and were up 8% year-over-year and up 4%
sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $446 million and up 13% year-over-year and up 6% on a
sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, favorable currency translation,
and higher transaction volumes. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets, new
business, and favorable currency translation.
Assets under custody administration for C&IS clients were $13.9 trillion at quarter-end, up 36% year-over-year
and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, new business and favorable
currency translation. The sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new business, partially
offset by unfavorable currency translation.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million were down 4% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially.
Both comparisons were impacted by higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by new business and

favorable markets. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $28 million in the first quarter compared to $11.4 million in the
prior quarter.
Assets under management for C&IS clients are $1.1 trillion, up 30% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The
growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The
sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows.
Securities lending fees were $18 million in the quarter, down 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The
year-over-year decline was driven by lower spreads while the sequential performance was driven by higher
volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. Average collateral levels were up 13% year-over-year and up 11%
sequentially.
Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $443 million and
were up 3% compared to both the prior year and prior quarter. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $22
million in the first quarter compared to $12 million in the prior quarter.
Across the regions both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, growth were impacted by favorable markets
partially offset by higher fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, fees were lower year-over-year and
sequentially, and primarily reflected higher fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets.
Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $355 billion at quarter-end, up 28% year-
over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows
while the sequential performance reflected favorable markets, partially offset by net outflows.
Moving to page 6, net interest income was $347 million in the quarter and was down 17% from the prior year.
Earning assets averaged $141 billion in the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $126
billion and were up 33% versus the prior year while loan balances averaged $34.2 billion and were up 6%
compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 1% in the quarter and was down 51 basis points from a
year ago. The net interest margin declined primarily due to lower interest rates as well as mix shift within the
balance sheet.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased slightly. Average earning assets increased 7% on a
sequential basis while average deposits were up 10%. The net interest margin declined five basis points
sequentially partially due to the balance sheet mix shift and lower rates.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.1 billion in the first quarter or 5% higher than the prior year and 3% lower
sequentially. The prior quarter included a $55 million severance charge related to a reduction in force and an
$11.9 million expense associated with an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate strategy.
Excluding these items, expenses were up 3% sequentially.
Compensation expense totaled $519 million and was up 4% compared to the prior year and was down 1%
sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, prior year base
pay adjustments, higher incentive expense, and unfavorable currency translation. Excluding the charge in the
prior period, compensation was up 10% sequentially, primarily driven by higher equity and cash based incentives.
This quarter's equity incentives included $32 million in expense associated with retirement-eligible staff compared
to $34 million in the prior year.

Employee benefits expense of $103 million was up 60% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-
over-year increase is primarily related to higher retirement, medical, and payroll withholding costs. The sequential
increase was primarily driven by higher payroll withholding partially offset by lower medical expenses.
Outside services expense is $196 million and was up 2% from a year ago and down 6% from the prior quarter.
The year-over-year growth was driven by higher sub-custody, third-party adviser, and market data costs, partially
offset by lower data processing and consulting costs. The prior quarter included $2.5 million charge. Excluding the
charge, costs were down 4% primarily due to lower legal, consulting, and technical services related costs.
Equipment and software expense of $177 million was up 9% from one year ago and flat sequentially. The year-
over-year growth reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense at $51 million
were down 1% from a year ago and down 24% on a sequential basis. The prior quarter included an $11.9 million
charge relating to an early lease exit. Excluding that charge, the category was down 8% on a sequential basis
driven by lower building operation costs and lower rent expense.
Other operating expense of $72 million was up 16% from a year ago and relatively flat sequentially. The year-
over-year increase was primarily driven by higher supplemental compensation plan expense and other
miscellaneous expenses partially offset by lower business promotion and staff-related cost.
Turn to page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% under the
standardized approach and 12.8% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.9% under both
the standardized and advanced approaches. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of
common stock at a cost of $136 million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share totaling $151 million
to common shareholders.
The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to
support our clients' needs. We continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise
they've come to expect. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, wealth management, asset
management and asset servicing, continues to resonate well in the marketplace.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark,
Lauren, and I would be happy to answer your questions. Olivia, please open the line.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess my question is on organic growth. I heard a lot of commentary
throughout your 18 minutes of prepared remarks, thank you very much, on positive net flows across most parts of
the business. I think in your prepared remarks, I heard you talk about ESG mandates within asset management
but maybe you can cover whether you quantify or qualify – I'll take either one – where you're seeing new
business, what kind of business you're winning in asset servicing and has there been any pandemic-related
pause that is now freeing up a logjam? So any color on that would be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Mike, you want to start on it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, Glenn, as you described there, we are seeing strong organic growth across the company and
specifically in asset servicing. And I would say the first place I would start is, the foundation of our growth strategy
is retaining existing clients. And as you would imagine, going through the pandemic, being able to support clients
has been extremely important but also I think earned us the right if you will to continue to serve our clients, many
of them our largest clients. So that's been a big positive.
Second, I would say is that we have seen I would say a full return to marketplace activity. So our clients, both
asset owners and asset managers, are actively looking at their own operating models and looking for
opportunities either to become more effective in how they invest on behalf of their beneficiaries or improving the
efficiency of the way they do that. So, consolidating operations or providers, utilizing new technology. And that
has played very well into our strategies in asset servicing that we've had underway for years.
So, thinking about things like Front Office Solutions, which is an investment book of record for clients that have
high levels of alternative assets, the ability to look at – across their portfolio in order to manage their business.
And then thinking about our asset manager clients, our whole office strategy is definitely resonating as well where
we can provide services across front, middle and back office. So, high level of activity and then I would say
success with strategies we've had in place for some time period.

Appreciate that. Maybe just the last follow-up on net interest income. The NIM was down 5 basis points but the
deposits are up a ton. Do you feel net interest income has now finally bottomed and maybe some back up of –
your thoughts behind that in terms of redeployment opportunities? Thank you. Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I don't want to call a bottom on it. I mean if you unpack the quarter effectively, we saw loan growth that was
strong and up $1 billion, and that – that has a few million dollar impact if you take our average return on those
assets.
If you think anywhere from 175 to 200 basis points on that $1 billion, you're going to get $4 million or $5 million in
lift for the quarter. And then, you also had obviously lift from the deposits overall. But that's offset by something
that's more predictable going forward, which is we're still going to have reinvestment in – as the security book
continues to mature and that's still got some maturation to do.
And so, it's easier to predict what's going to happen on the reinvestment side than what's going to happen on the
loan side. But obviously, if we continue to see strong loan demand, then that's more important than what we're
seeing on the other components of volume.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Hello, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I see at your annual meeting today a 2021 priority is productivity. So, I was wondering if you could put some
metrics around what you'd like to achieve. And on the positive side, I see that head count's down 1% quarter over
quarter. The pre-tax margin in the first quarter is back to the 30s where it was not last year at all. But on the
negative side, I have to imagine the fee waivers will continue and might actually increase. So, where does it all
end up and where would you like to get to this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Let me take that in a few different buckets. You're right. The productivity is, it's extraordinarily important.
And we go and we scratch and claw and do everything we can to earn new business. That's hard to do. It's not
overly predictable but what we can do is exhibit extreme discipline on the productivity side.
And so, we haven't put external metrics to that but we're looking at it a lot of different ways internally. We look at
operating leverage which we talked about earlier. We look at fee operating leverage. And then internally, we're
able to look at organic trust fee operating leverage.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
And so, from our perspective, we want to see – we don't want to just call expenses up or down because a lot of
our business relates – a lot of our expenses relates to the amount of new business that's coming in. And if we
continue to show growth in the different areas of the business, we're going to see lift in those expenses. We just
want to make sure it's related in the proper way to the organic growth that's coming in.
Now, you're right, head count was down and that comes back to the initiatives that we talked about in January.
And so, you see it's a meaningful reduction for us of about 300 head count and that played through in lower salary
expense for the company. And so, those are meaningful movements and I think reflective of the discipline and the
commitment we have around expense management.
And then on fee waivers, you're right. That is a – it's a very, very difficult dynamic that we're facing. And I also
think people need to realize we've talked about the fact that the $50 million we have this quarter, we're still seeing
lower rates on the short end of the curve. And as much as we've seen the 1 year, 5 year, 10 year up, we've seen
overnight repo at zero and one. And that's very difficult for a $275 billion pool of money market funds.
And that's why we've tried to give consistent information, not guidance but a consistent run rate on how those fee
waivers are going. And as of – as we sit right now, that number looks more like $65 million to $70 million on a
quarterly run rate basis. Hopefully, as the Fed balance sheet changes, we see some improvement there. But
that's where we sit today. And so, it's something we have to monitor. And obviously, that has a big impact on the
pre-tax margin you identified.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then the one tailwind you have, I guess the higher asset values, can you remind us of the relationship
between every change in the stock market and your fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. It's going to – it varies by the areas of the business that we're talking about. In general, 60% – in C&IS,
about 60% were based on asset values in some ways. And then in wealth, you can split it even more. And Mark,
you might have those numbers closer to top of your head but it's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Right. Yeah. The 60% in C&IS is related to asset values which would be all asset values, equity market – equity
assets as well as fixed income or cash. And then, as we look across in wealth management, there is more of a
relationship there to the assets. But the equity sensitivity, if that's what you were looking at, is a little different. In
the regions, the equity sensitivity is probably 50% to 55% whereas when you get to the Global Family Office,
there are the equity sensitivity is probably closer to a third just because of the way the client assets are allocated.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first on the loan – on and the balance sheet growth here,
quite robust deposit growth. It was a pretty significant inflection from how things were trending in the back half of
last year.
And so, curious about your thoughts there. How much of this do you view as excess? It seems as though a lot of
the central bank deposits on the asset side went up which would imply that you might think this is – these are
short duration deposits. So if you could give maybe some color on what your expectations are for the
sustainability of this growth in deposits? And how you might be thinking about redeploying those deposits over
time and how much time do you need in order to do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, you're right. I mean total interest related deposits up, interest-bearing deposits up. And I think the good
news is that interestingly, we were able to hold on to the margin. You saw a decline in LIBOR. And even in that
book we also saw a decline in cost, and despite the fact that part of the book is below zero, and I think that's
meaningful.
To get to your question about volume levels and the nature of the deposits, there's no doubt a lot of those
deposits are non-operational. And so we need to let them season before we would do much beyond putting those
at central banks. That said, there are other things we can do because we've got capacity in the balance sheet. But
obviously, the nature of how we run the treasury book is to let those types of deposits, the ones that are more
institutional and might be more transitional, season before we would take longer term exposure on those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then when we think about – I think you had commented, Jason, in
response to Glenn's question about that really, when you think about NII, it's a foot race in between loan growth
and reinvestment rates. Your loan growth picked up a bit here this quarter versus the trend of the back half of last
year, but period-end not necessarily all that higher than the average. So, how should we think about loan growth
from here? What are you seeing as far as demand for loans amongst your clients and is the rate for that loan
book still – are we still better off looking at the one-month and three-month LIBORs to think about those rates?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, first of all, the loan growth has come almost exclusively – or the vast, vast majority has come from the
wealth management side of the business. And even though in dollars, it's not as big as the deposits, the impact is
much more meaningful. And having $1 billion in higher average deposits, that's quite meaningful for NII. And
we've talked very consistently about the fact that the deposit levels are interesting. They're chunky but don't really
do too much on NII.
It is difficult to predict what the loan demand will be. However, what we've experienced isn't simply, I'd say,
random. We've talked about the fact that we have been communicating with clients more aggressively, and I –
this is over the last year and a half, two years about our desire to be with them and be a liquidity provider for
them.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Our liquidity engagement with clients is – it's a big part of our business. And that shows up not just in what we do
with the balance sheet on the – on deposits, but also money market funds where again $275 billion in AUM there,
and also on the lending side particularly on the wealth management clients. And so, it's more – this has been, I
think, more of a strategic lift. And so, that's not predictive but it's going to hold on or continue to accelerate. But
we don't see it as something that we're dismissing as potentially random either.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to shift gears a little bit maybe talk about capital a little
bit, and obviously, continue to be in very strong position across all the key ratios. Can you guys remind us kind of
kind of how you think about the binding constraints for Northern Trust obviously relative to regulatory minimums?
That's not kind of how you set the bar. You typically look at your peers. So, given some of the changes that they
have made and kind of how they're thinking about setting the minimum levels they're willing to run with, how does
that inform your view of excess capital at Northern Trust? And then, ultimately, how does that translate into your
appetite for increased buybacks from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, I mean, you're right that it's less of a process, less of an algebraic calculation and more where we want
to be on a relative basis at this point. You guys have heard us talk consistently about thinking about our
engagement with the board, with who we're totally aligned, but we want to make sure that conversation continues
to take place of where we are on an absolute basis, how we think about things on a relative basis and how we
think about things from a regulatory perspective.
And right now I'd say just keeping an eye on what the industry is doing is important. So the absolute levels, less
so. We've got plenty of room obviously from a CET1 perspective sitting at 12% given where the regulatory minima
are. And so if you think about Tier 1 leverage, even though the industry has talked about coming down
significantly, we've still printed well into the sixes and that's on $125 billion average deposit base.
So I'm not going to – I'm not giving you our buffers here but just take a 5% number, just to get at your question,
Alex, about what our capacity would look like. If you came all the way down to 5% that would translate to a
balance sheet of about $200 billion and you could have $170 billion in deposits, all else equal on the balance
sheet today. And so you're talking about easily $40 billion on a base of $125 billion currently. And so that's a lot of
room.
And I think also importantly, it's not like we use the balance sheet for clients that – for organizations we don't
know. We're really dealing from a candidate pool of depositors that are existing clients. And so at this point we
12

feel good about the capacity we have but it's obviously something that we're watching given how dramatically
things can change, given Fed actions and where deposits were 15 months ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Right. I guess I was trying to get more to the capital return framework of kind of how you guys thinking about the
opportunity for share repurchases from here given the excess capital that you've outlined?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thanks for clarifying. Let me tackle that directly. It's interesting because this quarter is a great example of how we
don't just think about do we buy back stock or not. There are different ways we can invest capital and that 10% to
15% return target, it comes up in everything we do from a capital perspective, including using the balance sheet
to help clients. And so, this quarter you saw the capital levels come down not because there is a meaningful
decline in CET1 but because there is more activity from a client perspective and that showed up with an increase
in RWA on the denominator.
And we saw higher sec lending activity, we saw higher lending activity, and we saw higher treasury activity in the
form of more bond buying, muni purchases. In each of those areas, we're thinking about what's the best way to
use our balance sheet in the long run and what's the best way to think about return. And for us, we can think
about the returns of buying back $1 of stock, we're looking at everything from what we think our returns are going
to be there, what are we getting in terms of price to book, we're also looking at the desire to be there with clients
and what those returns will look like.
And when we have the ability to think about lending or expanding C&IS relationships with the other things I
mentioned, those things come up as very attractive ways for us to use capital. It turns into better – it turns into
good growth for us in the long run and can good use of capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Great. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up around NIR again. So I think,
Jason, in the past, I think we talked a little bit about some sensitivities to sort of the repricing dynamics in the
securities portfolio. Maybe refresh us where that sort of stands today. So, securities portfolio yield, I think is about
1%, 1.20% or so. If you look at rates where they are today I want to say most of the securities portfolios already
repriced lower, but holding current rates constant, sort of how much more of a drag on the securities yield do you
guys expect to see over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Well, to give you a sense of what's repriced at this point, obviously, just take a – if you look at the $150
billion in earning assets, it's obviously, all of the money market assets have repriced, 85% of the loan book has
repriced – and it's $60 billion of the securities, so about 63% of the securities book has repriced at this point. And
so, that's where we sit at this point.
And then, it's interesting if you think about what's the impact of that, I'll tell you in this quarter alone, it was a
significant impact. We actually had – just from securities portfolio, the NIR was down $10 million. And so, that was
the drain on it. But that's not – I don't want you to think about that as a pure run rate because we're thinking there
13


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
about what's happening with the loan book. And so, there are other factors to play in as we're reinvesting those
securities. But I want to at least start with giving you the numbers that you asked for in terms of how much is
repriced and then also what the implications are.
But the runoffs coming through at this point, and also the fact that the – one, two, three, five-year where we tend
to be reinvesting has come up that, that has brought down the influence on a quarter-over-quarter basis as well.

Jason J. Tyler A

Hi, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Hey, good morning. How are you? If I can start off with maybe one of the [indiscernible] (00:39:44) and just
that comment you made on the 85% of the loan book has repriced, it looks like that yield has at least for the last
couple of quarters now bottomed and it's starting to move back up. So, my question would be around of the 15%
that's repricing. Sort of what are the dynamics on that versus maybe what are some of the new loans that you're
bringing on that's helping you improve that yield? And then, longer term most of that is tied to LIBOR. Maybe just
talk about the plan of whether some of those loans are going to use a new reference rate given the planned
cessation of LIBOR and how you're thinking about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, the longer dated loans are – often it's going to be in the mortgage book. And so, that's what's going to
take longer effectively, just so you know. The loans that have come on disproportionally – the growth has come,
again, within wealth. But within personal loans and within some of our more corporate-based organizations, we do
have a lot of corporate – there's small and mid-sized business activity in that book. And that's where a lot of the
growth has been.
And then, in terms of the LIBOR transition, yeah, as you know and I'm sure you're covering really closely, Brian,
there'll be a transition. And most that the industry seems to be looking to move from LIBOR to SOFR as a
reference rate. And so, watching that and the implications of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And is that transition to SOFR – I mean, I guess it's too early at this stage because there's not an effective term
rate, but I mean is there any – [indiscernible] (00:41:32) implication on the yields of the loan book by that
transition or is it simply too early?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, it's early but we – and I think the industry is hoping that they'll be – once we get to those transition dates,
there'll be more of a reset and we'll have not just the reference rate changes but the spread changes and – to
reflect because obviously SOFR is different. There's not credit. There's not duration in it. And so, it's a different
14


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
rate. And the relationship between LIBOR and SOFR is a lot different today than what it was even a year ago.
And so, I think the industry has got some work to do to work on what the conversations are going to be like at the
point where we actually make that hard switch.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, good morning. So, I had a couple of ticky-tack modeling questions. The first is just on the non-asset sensitive
fees within custody and fund administration. And we've had two pretty meaningful sequential increases these past
two quarters. That line item exited the quarter at about $178 million versus what historically had been a pretty
consistent range of $150 million to $160 million. Now, just curious what's driving the recent strength in that line
item. And maybe just as we think about from a modeling perspective, what's the right jumping off point we should
be thinking about as we look ahead to 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And just to make sure I'm tracking totally specific, you're talking about other noninterest income at $180
million on the income statement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
It's actually the $178 million within custody and fund administration, but it's the non-asset sensitive fee portions.
So, that's the part that will presumably move around with [indiscernible] (00:43:22).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, this is Mark. So, you're referring to when we talk about the sensitivity of those fees, that about 60% to
65% are asset-sensitive, and then the rest are kind of either – they're mixed quite frankly. There's transaction
volumes within those. There are some flat fees or fixed fees or even account level fees. So, you could maybe say
roughly half of it is transaction volume-related. So – and we did see a pickup this quarter in those transaction
volumes that created some of the sequential lift that we saw or a percent or 1% or so of the sequential lift that we
saw. So, I hope that is answering your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Yeah. That's efficient. So – but we should be expecting some normalization of that, I presume. It could be
higher than the $150 million to $160 million, but it sounds like the $178 million may have been a bit elevated, and
we could see some rebasing there. Is that fair?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
That's probably fair. I don't necessarily have the numbers that you're doing because I don't have it broken down
specifically like that. That's kind of a directional guide that moves around each quarter that split, but yes. I mean,
we did – we certainly saw heavier transaction activity during this most recent quarter that would have benefited
those fees by a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful color. And just for my follow-up on NII, actually, a bit more focus on the liability side. The beat
was helped by continued grind-down in those interest-bearing deposit costs. It's the second consecutive quarter
where we've actually seen that come down. Just curious, do you see any additional room to cut deposit costs
further if the rate backdrop holds or has that lever been largely exhausted at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
I felt decent about coming down a couple basis points in that book, and I think it's reflective that a lot of that book
is international. It's in currencies that are already used to having negative rates. And so, the dynamic that we've
talked about that once zero is broken, there's an expectation that the beta will continue at that point, seems to be
playing through there.
And so, wouldn't necessarily – we've talked to clients a lot about where rates are there because it's obviously –
can be a sensitive topic. But I think the win there is we've got good dialogue with clients that indicate we're all
looking at things like the euro the same way and tracking deposit costs. So, we don't have further deterioration as
the asset side compresses more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A

Morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on organic growth and if you can provide some
good color on asset servicing [indiscernible] (00:46:24) question. But just in investment management and
particularly in wealth, are you starting to see improvement as COVID conditions improved versus last year? And
how is the competitive backdrop changed just given that it seems like everybody has been focused on that part of
the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, in Wealth, we've continued to grow. But you're right, the marketplace is extremely competitive which is why
it's so important that we stay focused on both the parts of the market where we think we compete most effectively
and on providing for the clients in that segment. So, where we're seeing our strongest growth has been in the
upper part of the market there.
16


Northern Trust Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
So think about clients with assets above $20 million. And particularly, during this time period where equity values
are going up, there's obviously been an increase in wealth. So, that drives growth, but then also with the change
in administration and potential changes in taxes and things like that, it increases the need for planning. So, a high
level of activity both with our existing clients but also opportunities with prospects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the expense outlook, I realize you guys try to focus on aligning that sort of
lower than the organic growth levels that firm over time. But as we transition from, say, the low short rates, its
headwinds, to NII and waiver headwinds, say, eventually stabilizing, and then as short rates rise and eventually
becomes [indiscernible] (00:48:09), like any necessary like investment areas ahead or like new efficiency areas
post-COVID like real estate that we should be thinking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll start, then I'm sure Jason can add detail to it. But it's – on the expense side, it's a very dynamic situation right
now. What I mean by that is we're obviously still in this resiliency mode that we talked about, which has certain,
say, costs to it, but also there are certain expenses that we're not incurring at this point. So obviously, travel and
business promotion is lower than it was pre-pandemic. We're not operating with as many people in our facilities.
The costs of operating those facilities is lower. So, you do have some lower costs on that front that to the extent
that we transition out of that you would expect that those would increase.
The second thing I would say is with regard to the organic growth that we've talked about, it does require
investment. That can be supporting large new clients. And it also can come in the form of bringing on new talent
to continue this growth. I mean as you bring on new talent, you want to make sure that you're providing the right
level of service across all of our businesses. And that means making sure that we have the people that go along
with this.
And then the third piece I would just say is around our digitalization efforts which, again, have accelerated in the
last year. And I think we're seeing the benefit of that, but it does require investment in technology as well to
ensure that, yes, we're adding those capabilities but we're doing it in the right, safe, secure, stable way.
So that backdrop does say okay, we're going to continue to grow but it's going to require investment. And that's
why Jason talked about earlier, we also have to be focused on efficiency. And we did see as a part of the remote
working environment, there are some efficiencies in that as well. And so how can we, for example, look at our real
estate footprint and see if there are opportunities to shrink the footprint and use that to support some of the
investment that I talked about.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Hi, good morning. Okay. Couple of other themes that we haven't touched on yet. One is around the wealth
management business and the virtual advising strategy. I know that's been well underway for a while. I just
wanted to get a sense as to if the demand for that is more run rate at this stage or are you still seeing acceleration
of demand for that strategy that you've got there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So the way we've tackled the kind of virtual engagement through with clients in the wealth side is the continued
use of our goals-driven wealth management approach. And so, we were able very quickly to take those
discussions and then have virtual conversations. But with that same very – what we think is a very differentiated
platform with clients through COVID, it was very good. Engagements were very, very strong. And it's led the
business to feel that there's strong momentum from an overall client engagement perspective. So that's gone
well. And it's one of the continued large investments in wealth management.
And Mike just talked about our investment in digitizing the business. That's an area where we can use that as a
core platform, but add journeys to it, add specific areas to become more and more detailed and specific with how
– with matching up with what our clients are going through. Very strong investment for us and it's been extremely
positive.
Our Net Promoter Scores – Steve Fradkin who runs that business. He's just talking about how strong those are.
And so clearly, that investment has been paying off with good client engagement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just separately, I know you've been in the press recently with regard to some of the crypto-
custody activities that you are working on. Not sure when it's going to be launched but I think you've got a
partnership going on with Standard Chartered. So maybe you can give us some color on that.
And part of the question too is, does it just end with custody or can you foresee an opportunity to enable – to offer
crypto to your clients? When I think about European investors, well not just investors but the servicers, the asset
managers that you work with over there dealing with negative rates, what I hear is that there is a decent demand
for going into crypto because at least it's not negative interest rate. So, how far is it until you – or how long is it
until you offer crypto as one of your liquidity tools, just kind of thinking out loud.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Betsy, as you know, the financial markets are constantly innovating and evolving, have for some time period,
and in the business we're in, we absolutely have to keep pace with that and do it in a way that, again, it allows us
to provide the safety and security for the clients and managing their assets. And crypto and digital assets, more
broadly, is right now, clearly, one of the areas that's evolving the fastest.
And so, on that front, to your point, with regard to custody of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies, we've partnered
with Standard Chartered in a venture called Zodia which will provide that crypto-custody. And I think what's
important there what we're trying to accomplish is leverage the traditional custody expertise that we have, that
Standard Chartered has as well, but do it in a fintech way. So that's why it's a separate independent entity that
again, can develop and evolve at that pace. And at this point, we still expect at some point in 2021 that that will be
18


Northern Trust Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
approved for client use. So again, it's going to be done, not only our own, I'll call it approvals, but also from a
regulatory perspective.
And then, I think, more broadly to your point, absolutely, we see many different potential opportunities in this
space where clients will look at digital assets and potentially cryptocurrencies in order to address various either
challenges they have or ways to earn better returns. And that's why we've not only done what I talked about in
cryptocurrencies but more broadly with the digital assets, whether it's tokenization which we've done with
BondEvalue, whether it's developing a PE capability on blockchain which we've done with Broadridge. There's a
number of different areas where we've experimented either on our own or with partners in order to be able to be a
part of that innovation.

Operator: Thank you. We will now move to our next question that is coming from Jim Mitchell with Seaport
Global Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Hey. Maybe just a question on the wealth management business. It seemed to be quite a bit
of disparity in the outcomes even though market appreciation where there's lag basis or month lag or full quarter
lag was pretty similar. So, is it just there's a lot more fee waivers in the Global Family Office? How do we think
about that sort of difference?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You hit it right. There is a distinction in the lag in that business. But that's not what drove it, frankly. It was –
it's the waivers hit hard. And we've talked about the fact that people shouldn't see waivers as linear. This is a
good example where the waivers – and that the GFO business obviously, much more institutional. And so the
waivers hit later. And we're now starting to see it come in whereas the regions have more traditional closer to but
not retail pricing. And so, those waivers just hit earlier.
Second dynamic though is GFO is spiky. And we have clients there that will move billions of dollars. And so you
can have one, two, three clients that if they're all – have significant movements, then you'll – you can see big
movements on a sequential basis. If you look year-over-year, the organic growth – the growth rate overall for
GFO is actually slightly higher than the regions. But obviously, this sequential look was impacted by those two
things; one, waivers, and two, some spiky very large client movement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. So, the incremental hit to fee waivers, is that also going to be in 2Q more in Global Family Office and
maybe C&IS or how do you think about the geography of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think we're – I think from here, it's somewhat – it's going to be more linear. I mean the funds are more – they're
all there at this point in waiver mode. And so, I don't think we're going to see as big of a disparity going forward.
But people should just realize it's not a linear relationship. And I think there is – overall, it was $22 billion, $23
billion in wealth and $9 billion of that was in – $9 billion, almost $10 billion was in GFO. And so that's a year-over-
19


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
year look. That's just aggregate effectively. But the one-quarter look, it was $5 million in GFO alone. And so, big –
that was the increased quarter-over-quarter.

Hey, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning, guys. To circle back a bit to the buyback, I mean it's good to see you guys out there buying
$135 million of stock. Historically, it feels like the actual buyback comes in kind of below – at least our estimated
capacity is somewhat regularly. I think first quarter might have given us a partial edge with risk-weighted asset
growth. But can you help kind of differentiate kind of the buyback, the difference in your thinking between just
being conservative versus the expectation that risk-weighted assets could actually continue ramping up like they
did in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's completely related and it comes back to that theme of wanting to think about returns. And so – and for
us, it's not like we're making a decision of do we buy back stock or just park money at the Fed at 10 basis points.
For us – but it's nice to be able to see that client activity is driving the alternative to share buybacks, so that's
certainly not to say that we're doing zero or very little. It's just to say those are the different options we think about.
And you saw sec lending activity up significantly. Just the loan demand being up $1 billion, that's going to cause
$1 billion in higher RWA just in and of itself.
And then, you see the deposits coming in which is – it's nice for us to be able to answer a client need. But that
comes with – that comes with RWA as we redeploy it on the asset side. And so, the best thing we can do is have
the balance sheet used for good return on equity activity that's client-related building relationships in the long run.
But at the same time, we did do $150 million in share repurchase over the timeframe. So, it's not like we were
absent in the market, but you can imagine here at 12%, we're going to be looking at what does AOCI look like,
what does client activity look like in balancing all of those things together.

Okay. Thanks. And just to touch on kind of the fee growth, I guess growth across relative businesses, it seems
like C&IS has been outgrowing wealth management, at least outpacing it for a while now. I mean is that the right
way that we should think about those two business trajectories going forward growth-wise, or is there a reason to
think that kind of wealth management could start kind of catching up with C&IS?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
A couple of things. One, look, every time – over long periods of time, we think one of the businesses is growing
faster and we think, oh this is going to be the case for the future, you get an inflection. The businesses have acted
as good hedges to each other. And it's always difficult to predict those inflection points and what's going to grow
faster.
For sure, if you look over the last couple or few years, you'd see C&IS having grown faster. But in general, wealth
has got good exposure to equity markets. And so – and you also think over the long run, there's a good title
growth particularly at the top end of the wealth market. And so, those things should help as well. And so, we

And I would just add to Jason's comments. That's why we really like the combination of the three businesses. Not
only is it complementary from a client perspective, but also from a financial perspective they have different
dynamics. So, the asset servicing business which Pete Cherecwich has done a great job leading and growing at a
high rate, it also requires resources to do that as we've talked about that, and has different levels of volatility in the
business; whereas in wealth management, very steady and at a high level of profitability and scalable. And then
with asset management, again, very high level of operating leverage in the business and has been positioned
over the last couple of years. For example, when you can get positioned in the right products, for example in
liquidity, and the markets go up or the liquidity goes up, very strong increase in profitability for that. And focused
on other areas where we can have that same dynamic with ESG and quant.
So we like all the businesses, I would say, from a client-competitive perspective but also from a financial
perspective.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Morning, guys. Question from me on organic growth. I think a year ago the prospects for organic growth were
probably more uncertain. Fast forward to today, your comments have been really positive. Coming out of 2020, do
you see any new or different sources of organic growth that could maybe increase the long-term sustainable rate
you think you're capable of achieving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll start, but Mike, I'm sure, has some comments on this as well. And let's take those – let's take the different
businesses. In C&IS, we hinted even early today the Integrated Trading Solutions is something we've talked about
a little bit over the last few months. That's come through. That's part of the reason I think there's been that lift in
brokerage commission income, done strategic things in foreign exchange and those aren't – so it's not accidental.
I think that we've had lift in those areas. And then Front Office Solutions is another area where we're trying to go
to sophisticated clients and show the breadth of what we can do.
In wealth management, the engagement there is around expanding and continuing to invest in goals-driven
wealth management. And the growth we've had particularly in the upper end, that product gets to – we've thought
so much about what $50 million, $100 million and hundreds of millions of dollar clients need in order to interact in
a good holistic way. I think we're set up well there.
And then in asset management, $215 billion, I remember about a year-and-a-half ago where we were on a
liquidity perspective to now $275 billion. And yeah, there's been great growth in the industry, but they did a lot of
hard things to get cut off times done well, to get – to open a Northern Trust portal. There's so many different – to
invest in the talent we have in that group.
And then if you think about our ESG and quant capabilities, ESG assets are over $130 billion now. Great
engagement across the Nordics with very strong client base there and doing a lot with our ETF platform, including
launching new products in Europe there. And so, in each of the areas, I think there's good opportunity for us to
leverage the work that's been done to lead to stronger organic growth.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just to follow-up on the Integrated Trading Solutions, can you explain
that a little bit, how it actually works? Are you – is it an electronic thing or is it people that you're providing instead
of your asset management clients having them? And how does that work if it's, if five of your clients want to buy

one particular stock, how are you separating all of that? And can you give a little more color on how this actually
works?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. At 25,000 feet, you can think about it as almost trading outsourcing and investment trading outsourcing, and
where – a lot of clients realize, a lot of our asset management clients realize that their core competencies around
security selection and research and not necessarily having the trading operations, the back office that comes with
that in trade or entry. And so our ability to say, you can work with us and we can be your effective outsourced
trading partner, it appeals to a lot of asset management clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So they don't have to have a trade anymore? And are just providing the back office for trading?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
No. It starts with trading. They can – we can have portfolio managers and their middle office send us model
accounts, send us trades, and we can provide that service for them and be more of a full outsourced operation
from them from middle office through trade execution and trade management.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. All right. I'll follow-up maybe a little more offline. Going back to the capital question, Jason, Mike, so I hear
you want to obviously – you're thinking about client needs and all of that stuff. But even if we factor that in as we
think about it, what level are you sort of comfortable running your various capital ratios at whether it's Tier 1
leverage or whether it's CET1? Is it at 10% or is it at 11%, whatever the form it gets through, whether it's through
loan growth, securities lending growth and/or buybacks? What is sort of that cutoff point below which you don't
want to go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
From our perspective, I think it still is going to depend on where the industry – where our peers and our regulators
asking us to hold on to capital to not buy back stock at that time. I don't – we don't call an absolute level. We
haven't talked about our buffers externally. Obviously, we're running significantly above any regulatory minima,
but we haven't – and so, we've got buffers that we use internally to manage that, not something we've talked
about externally.
But when we engage with clients, we want to be able to continue telling them that they've got – that they're
interacting with a balance sheet that's strong on an absolute and a relative basis, and it doesn't have – it's part of
our strategic strength when we talk to clients. And a lot of institutions you think about, not just pension funds but
even sovereign wealth funds, if they're investing – if they're depositing $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion,
they're not really depositing; they're lending to their banks at that point. And they want to be operating with
institutions that are strong. And so, we're always going to be looking and seeing where the tides are in the
industry to make sure we reflect strong capital levels.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Jason. Hi, Mike. How are you? Can you share with us – I know you're not a prime broker, but there was that
trading mishap in March with supposedly a large family office which probably was a hedge fund.
But can you just give us any color because we have never seen any risk in your Global Family Office business at
all. Can you reassure us that's still the case? And just maybe some color around how you manage that business
and manage those risks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, a couple of things. I mean you're right. We're not a prime broker. And so, we're not providing that type
of trading leverage to – where we're alongside clients and taking positions is we're dealing with either our hedge
fund clients or our family office clients.
In the family office business, we have some loans, but those are much more the loans that we see in the
traditional wealth business which are loans against investments that clients will have. The long-term clients,
they're not taking that type of exposure. And so, the services that we provide for our hedge fund clients and our
GFO clients, it's much more about assets servicing, asset administration, investment reporting. That's how we're
going to market to deal with those types of clients.
And so, just to put anybody's mind to rest, we didn't have any exposure to the hedge fund/family office that you're
talking about and don't see that type of exposure in our portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Speaking of asset servicing and reporting that you just did, is there an opportunity to capitalize, and if the SEC
requires more disclosure from the family office organizations as a possibility as a result of what happened, would
that be an opportunity for you guys to do more work for your customers, and therefore, maybe more revenues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's an interesting nuance because we – a lot of our clients on the hedged space, they actually are SEC-
registered and so, we're used to dealing with them and helping those types of institutions on doing the reporting
and administration that they need to do for their SEC registration material and engagement. And so, that – it
would be – I don't think it's monumental opportunity for us. We haven't talked about it that way. But certainly we
have that capability set and would be seen as a strong provider for hedge funds that were looking to have more of
a traditional investment reporting and an overall fund administration engagement with their service providers.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Great. Thanks, guys. Two questions. One, first one on the comp expenses. I heard that the
$30 million of comp was retirement eligible. And then did you also say that you absorbed the merit increases
year-over-year so those are getting paid out in the first quarter now? I thought that was getting paid up in the
second quarter historically. Just going to think of the 2Q to 1Q trend here for comp.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. No. The merit will come through second quarter. What I did mention earlier was that this may have been
what you got your mind going is we – the reduction in overall FTE and head count for the company did lead to a
lower salary level in the quarter. But that one-off – but that's not – that's distinct from the merit increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
And just to clarify – this is Mark – the base pay adjustment, the year-over-year increase is still reflecting of any
base pay adjustments that happened in the previous year. We're still lapping that. So, if that's what you were
referring to, Brian, in the release there and some of the comments we made, that would have been what that was
referring to, not this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. And then can you guys just talk about the trends in investment management? I think even you've
adjust for the fee waivers looking at the first quarter relative to the third quarter, you're not seeing much in terms
of revenue growth despite the change in market levels over that time period. Can you just maybe touch on the
flows in that segment? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
1Yeah. Mark may want to touch on close in general but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So in the C&IS line, I think that's what you're looking at, the investment management fees. On a sequential
basis ex waivers, I think we were up about 6%. Probably three quarters of that, two-thirds to three quarters of that
came from a market lift, so there was some sequential organic growth there. But I don't know if that's what
specifically you were looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
For the fee waiver. So, I mean, it sounds like flow trends in there are more positive.

Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. There was some flow activity that we saw there. Like Mike had mentioned, we've been seeing good growth
in ESG, some of the quant active products as well, but the waivers there on a sequential basis certainly kind of
overwhelmed what we saw from both favorable markets as well as business flows.
