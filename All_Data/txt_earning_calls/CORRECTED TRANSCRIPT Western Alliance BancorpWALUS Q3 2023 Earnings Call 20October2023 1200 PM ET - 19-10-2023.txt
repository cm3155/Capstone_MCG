President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Miles. Good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter 2023 results,
and then I'll turn the call over to Dale. One year ago on our Q3 2022 call, we discussed our plans to temper
balance sheet growth to bolster capital and liquidity in order to reinforce our financial foundation and position the
bank to navigate through a volatile rate environment.
The events of the spring caused by duration mismatch at several regional banks validated the importance of our
strategy and accelerated its implementation to surgical balance sheet reposition. A recalibration of our business
model to enhance overall liquidity and deposit granularity is designed to make the balance sheet unassailable in
the event of another significant market disruption.
As a result, our CET1 capital has grown from 8.7% a year ago to 10.6% today. Our HFI loan to deposit ratio has
improved from 94% to 91%. To provide enhanced protection to depositors and cement the stability of our deposit
base, insured and collateralized deposits have risen from 47% at year-end to 82%. In order to fortify our liquidity
position we have materially increased our cash and investment securities and now have $3.2 billion of high quality
liquid asset treasuries.
Having established strong capital, liquidity, and deposit granularity, a sturdy foundation has been laid to deliver
earnings improvement going forward. Over the last several quarters, we have prioritized stabilizing and growing
deposits, as well as optimizing the liability structure by paying down borrowings. This has led to net interest
margin growing from our second quarter trough as we have sustained improvement in our funding structure,

lowered our adjusted efficiency, and produced above peer return on average assets and return on average
tangible common equity.
Over the next one to two quarters, we will complete the optimization of our funding structure and be well-
positioned to deploy excess core deposits into loan growth. In the third quarter, Western Alliance profitability,
strong liquidity generation, and stable asset quality are proof points to the dexterity of our diversified business
model.
Before handing the call over to Dale, I wanted to highlight the drivers of our strong deposit growth in Q3. Core
commercial clients, both new and existing, were the primary sources contributing to $3.1 billion of growth.
Mortgage warehouse and HOA pushed growth upward, and the regional network posted a second consecutive
quarter of vigorous deposit contributions. Overall, deposit costs increased 27 basis points, though overall cost of
interest bearing liabilities compressed 5 basis points to 2.8% in Q3 as we utilized deposits to pay down higher
cost borrowings, which Dale will comment on later.
Liquidity came in ratably over the quarter to push down our average borrowings. Core commercial deposits cost a
marginal 4.04%, including cost of earning credit rates. Cultivating multiproduct customer relationships remains
critical for solidifying and growing client relationships, which has held in the mid-80% range in recent quarters.
Our digital consumer channel, a source of liquidity uncorrelated with our core commercial business lines,
generated approximately $800 million this quarter at attractive rates relative to the marginal cost of repaid
borrowings.
In short, I feel confident in the vitality of our deposit franchise and how it sets up for future success. Now, Dale will
take you through our financial performance.

Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $217 million, EPS of $1.97, and pre-
provision net revenue of $290 million. Net interest income increased $37 million during the quarter to $587 million
through the repricing of earning assets, as well as a reduction in higher cost borrowings. Non-interest income
increased $10 million to $129 million, which included approximately $6.5 million of non-recurring pre-tax items
such as fair value adjustments.
AmeriHome was moderately impacted by rising mortgage rates and treasury yields, with mortgage banking
revenue declining $7 million to $79 million, as lock volume fell 5% quarter-over-quarter and production margins
compressed slightly to 38 basis points. Non-interest expense growth was primarily driven by higher deposit costs
and software licensing and depreciation expenses. Deposit costs of $128 million demonstrated our deposit share
gains from new [indiscernible] (00:06:00) previous clients returning funds to the [ph] range (00:06:01).
Provision expense was $12 million due to stable asset quality and loan growth concentrated in low loss
categories. Our provision modeling remains conservative given the weighting of the Moody's Consensus forecast
in severely adverse scenarios which, in aggregate, implies an 80% probability of recession.
Lastly, our tax rate rose because of discrete non-deductible items in the quarter. We expect our tax rate to fall
back to between 20% and 21% going forward. Overall, we made substantial progress in increasing on-balance
sheet liquidity with investments in cash 19% higher quarter-over-quarter, mostly from adding more high quality
liquid assets. Deposit share gains and balance sheet remixing also pushed wholesale borrowings lower cash.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Cash and cash equivalents alone totaled $3.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion last quarter. With our strong deposit
growth and capital levels, we are likely to reclassify $1.3 billion of non-AmeriHome held-for-sale loans back to
held-for-investment as organic loan growth has slowed. These transferred loans are short duration, low credit risk
assets, which we believe are better served generating interest income for the bank going forward.
Remaining loans held-for-sale consists entirely of AmeriHome residential inventory to be sold to the GSEs and
have an average duration of only about two weeks. Including $1.3 billion of loans transferred from held-for-sale,
loans held-for-investment rose $1.6 billion to [indiscernible] (00:07:39). As Ken mentioned, deposits increased
$3.2 billion to $54 billion at quarter-end.
Mortgage servicing rights increased in part due to the higher rate environment and stood at $1.2 billion on
September 30. Total borrowings declined by $820 million to $9.6 billion at quarter-end, but average borrowings
declined nearly $6 billion quarter-over-quarter, primarily from the repayment of federal home loan bank
borrowings and private equity lines obtained from March earlier this year.
Organic held-for-investment loans grew $240 million, primarily from C&I and centered around mortgage
warehouse, MSR financing, and corporate finance, with smaller contributions from regional banking. HFI
construction and land loan growth of $241 million, derived mostly from light banking loans reclassified from held-
for-sale status. Given the national undersupply of homes, we still view the macro backdrop for this product
favorably despite the elevated rate environment.
Total deposit growth of $3.2 billion resulted primarily from an increase in core deposits and also reflects a
reduction in wholesale brokered deposits of over $400 million. Core deposit growth was fueled by $1.3 billion in
non-interest-bearing DDA growth led by mortgage warehouse, and $1.6 billion in savings and money market
growth. Non-interest-bearing DDA comprise a third of our total deposits, of which approximately 40% have no
cash payments of earnings credits.
Quarter-to-date, deposit growth has surpassed $3 billion, though semi-annual seasonality in mortgage warehouse
deposits and tax to insurance escrow funds will pull this number down as payments are made this quarter.
Turning now to net interest drivers. Stable repricing at a higher rate environment increased the yield on earning
assets. Optimization of the liability structure by growing deposits to pay down [indiscernible] (00:09:33) short-term
borrowings led to a lower cost of funding – liability funding. The securities portfolio grew $1 billion to $11.4 billion
as we prioritized adding HQLA to the balance sheet. The yield on total investments expanded 15 basis points to
4.91%. $1.8 billion in securities yielding 4.77% are also expected to mature by year-end, with another $2 billion
yielding 4.98% maturing in 2024.
Similarly, HFI loans increased 25 basis points to 6.73%, with a quarter-end spot rate of 6.99%. In a higher for
longer rate environment, we expect to benefit from favorable asset pricing tailwinds. Total fixed to variable loan
maturities are expected to average $2.4 billion per quarter for the first three quarters of 2024.
Our strategy to right-size the liability funding structure through increased savings and money market accounts
resulted in a 41-basis-point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. Importantly, this enabled a $5.9
billion reduction in average short-term borrowings to 14% of interest-bearing liabilities, which resulted in a 5-basis-
point reduction in the overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 2.8% in the third quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
As noted on our last earnings call, we believe net interest income and net interest margin reached a cyclical
trough in the second quarter. Net interest income grew nearly 7%, despite a modest contraction in average
earning assets, and the margin expanded 25 basis points quarter over quarter to 3.67%.
Considering the impact of future rate changes, our rate risk profile is modestly asset sensitive. Our plus 100 basis
points rate shock analysis on a static balance sheet indicates net interest income is expected to lift approximately
4% and decrease a similar amount on a minus 10 basis points shock.
However, considering where comprehend through review of interest rate risk, we projected 2.2% increase in
earnings at risk from a 100-basis-point negative shock on a static balance sheet, which is inclusive of estimated
declines in ECR-related deposit costs. Additionally, in a lower rate environment, mortgage banking acts as a
shock absorber to our asset sensitive balance sheet from increased refinance activity and gain on sale margin
expansion.
Our efficiency ratio of 58.8% was 170 basis points higher than in Q2; though our adjusted efficiency ratio,
excluding the impact of ECRs, [ph] fell (00:12:08) 50 basis points to 50% as mortgage warehouse average
balances with ECRs increased $2.4 billion to $11 billion in the third quarter.
Lower compensation expense resulted from normal seasonal factors and mitigated higher software licensing and
data processing costs. We still view a mid- to upper-40% efficiency ratio as indicative of the right medium-term
level of investments to fund new business initiatives and the ongoing evolution of our risk management
framework.
Pre-provision net revenue was $290 million for the quarter. Solid profitability was maintained in Q3 with a stable
return on average assets of 1.24% on a larger balance sheet. Return on average tangible common equity of
17.3% was modestly below our Q2 level as our capital [indiscernible] (00:13:00). Our proactive credit mitigation
strategy has been effective thus far in normalizing credit environment. Asset quality was stable in Q3 as the
aggregate net increase in special mention loans to classified assets was only $9 million.
Notably, non-performing assets declined $22 million to $245 million, or 35 basis points of total assets. Quarterly
net loan charge-offs were $8 million, or 7 basis points of average loans, compared to $7.4 million, or 6 basis
points, in the second quarter. Due to growth in low to no loss categories in conjunction with stable asset quality
led to a smaller provision expense even in a normalizing credit environment.
Our total funded ACL increased $6 million from the prior quarter to $327 million as HFI growth occurred almost
entirely in near zero loss categories, most prominently in mortgage warehouse. As a reminder, even after
repaying two credit-linked notes, 22% of our loan portfolio was still protected, with any losses incurred to be
covered by a third-party.
The total loan ACL to funded loans ticked down 2 basis points to 74 basis points, but did increase 13 basis points
to 154% of non-performing loans. We view our allowance as appropriate, especially when considering the
material portion of loans covered by [indiscernible] (00:14:25) credit protection from credit-linked notes and low
loan loss categories.
Additionally, a sizable portion of our loan growth has been concentrated in low to no loss products. Our loan
portfolio is diversified across [indiscernible] (14:36) segments with almost a quarter of it either credit protected,
government guaranteed, or cash secured; and over half of the portfolio is either insured or resistant to economic
volatility. If adjusted for these factors, our ACL ratio rises to 1.34% of loans.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Our strong organic capital growth lifted the CET1 ratio to 10.6%, or [indiscernible] (00:15:02) when adjusted for
AOCI and tax effected unrealized held to maturity securities marks. Our tangible common equity to total assets
decreased approximately 20 basis points from Q2 to 6.8% as the balance sheet expanded modestly, while capital
growth was curtailed by a higher AOCI mark.
Given the 45-basis-point rise in the five-year treasury during the quarter, AOCI reached [ph] reduced (00:15:25)
tangible common equity by $732 million. Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.36 per share, our
tangible book value per share increased $0.57 in the quarter to $43.66. The quarter-over-quarter increase
resulted from our earnings outpacing industry-wide AOCI headwinds stemming from rising rates.
I'll now turn the call back to Ken.

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. Our guidance for the rest of 2023 continues to be informed by the strategies and priorities laid out
in our prior earnings call. So as we look forward to Q4, you can expect loans and core deposits are expected to
be fairly flat to several hundred million dollars higher in Q4. Net deposit growth will be impacted by normal Q4
seasonal reductions in mortgage warehouse deposits, offset by growth in the regional divisions and the digital
consumer channel.
Deposits should still outpace loan growth. Going into 2024, we expect loan and deposit growth to return to our
prior guidance. Regarding capital; having close to 40 basis points of our medium-term CET1 target of 11%, we
forecast continued although more gradual progress towards this goal which we remain on track to achieve in
2024.
Net interest margin should remain in line with our Q3 level in a range of 3.60% to 3.70%, supported by asset
pricing tailwinds and additional, if more tempered borrowing repayment opportunities. Our adjusted efficiency
ratio, which excludes the impact of deposit costs, should remain consistent with Q3 levels. Regarding operating
PPNR, we expect Q4 to be generally consistent with Q3, excluding the onetime items noted, and acknowledging
that mortgage banking revenue will be influenced by the impact of the rate environment on mortgage gain on sale.
Asset quality remains manageable. Projects continue to be supported by sponsors. Based on our conservative
underwriting and low advance rates, credit losses are still expected to be 5 to 15 basis points through this
economic cycle.
At this time, Dale, Tim, and I are happy to take your calls – questions, sorry.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Casey,
your line is open. Please go ahead.

Yeah. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first question...

on the NIM. Can you just walk us through...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
[indiscernible] (00:18:22).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Just walk us through, I guess, what the NIM guide presumes in the way of borrowings? Obviously,
your deposit growth, very strong quarter-to-date. I think, Ken, you mentioned you do expect that to pay down. And
so just that would bring the borrowings which were up pretty significantly period-end versus the average in 3Q.
Just wondering where that would end up in the fourth quarter here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we have some seasonality within deposit categories that affects this number, but the direction of
borrowings is going to continue to be down. So, we paid off several of our more expensive funding sources that
we achieved or acquired late in the first quarter. And there's a little bit left. I expect we'll pay down that amount as
well. So, we should continue to see kind of improvement there. Where you see, we're reasonably balanced on
target for loan to deposit growth this quarter, I think you should see some kind of modest improvement in ending
balances as well. And I think the average balances should improve somewhat as well, but not to the degree they
did in the third quarter over the second.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, Casey. As you've seen, we took down our short-term borrowings by $870 million. But any time we have any
excess liquidity floating around, we'll use it to pay down borrowings. So the average borrowings declined $6 billion
in the quarter, and that helped bring down our lower funding rate.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And just, Dale, wanted to follow up on your comments on the fixed rate asset repricing benefit in the
first three quarters of 2024. I think you said $2.4 billion per quarter. Can you give us a sense of where...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...like what the blended yield is on that and what that can reprice through? Just trying to quantify what the
repricing benefit could be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, in terms of what the repricing could be, these are coming off at something in the kind of around the higher 7s.
And rates today have spreads of really not less than 300 basis points, 350 bps from there. And so, [indiscernible]
(00:20:50) another rate increase in there. So, I would take that on top of SOFR today. So something in the lower
8%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So, over $7 billion of loans in the first three quarters with 100 bp left?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Approximately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. Just last one for me on the expenses. Obviously, that was the one thing that kind of surprised
negatively this quarter on the deposit costs. So, I have the deposit with ECR, the DDA with ECR, up 15%, but the
deposit costs were up 40%. So I'm just trying to – like, why the disconnect? Is there a different pricing dynamic
today than there was historically? Just trying to understand that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, it was, we had higher balances and higher rates. And I think the average balance was elevated. The
average balance was up 48% during the quarter. So, it wasn't – let me approach it differently. In terms of the
spreads that these clients received, there were virtually no change.

...getting back to the $500 million per quarter loan growth target at $2 billion deposit growth in 2024. Once you

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, this is Ken. I think so. I think some of the investments that we've made in a number of our deposit-centric
business lines will continue to propel deposits forward along the guide that we gave. And as we recalibrate to a
mid-80s loan to deposit ratio, we'll then turn off the loan growth machine. We've proven here over time that we
can generate sound, thoughtful, reasonable loan growth with very little asset quality problems.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then going back to Casey's question on expenses. Excluding the ECR-related deposit costs
which flow through, so if we put those aside, how are you guys thinking about expense growth over the next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, running from Q3 to Q4, expenses, absent the deposit costs, will be relatively flat, okay. And as we enter into
2024, there will be marginal expense growth. And that marginal expense growth will be predicated on continuing
to invest in new products, new services, new business lines, continuing to build out our risk management
framework.
The hallmark of Western Alliance has been this continuous investment through all cycles to kind of grow the
business for future quarters and years. And so, as long as the risk return and the investment returns are there,
we'll continue to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. So, from an efficiency ratio perspective, are you thinking that we'll have improvement through 2024 or that
will keep about where you ended the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I'd say about where we landed in the fourth quarter. Back to your actually your first question as we probably
exit the second quarter and we achieve our loan to deposit ratio, we'll be able to step on the accelerator of loan
growth and that will generate higher interest income, which should provide the denominator of that equation to
grow at a faster pace. But right now, if you're modeling, I would say, keep it consistent with Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. But it sounds like revenue's set to accelerate here with the margin being more stable. Like you said, more
loan growth coming in next year. But we should think you're going to spend more of that, at least at this juncture,
right? Because it seems like the setup is the efficiency ratio improvement next year. But you're saying at least at
this point, don't expect that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think it is set up that way, but it's a little bit deferred in terms of when that takes place because of the
reasons Ken was talking about that we're going to be sluggish on having the loan growth really kind of match to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Dale and Ken, I want to go about that one a little bit different. You're going to be at your 11%
target within a couple of quarters, if not one to two quarters. I'm not sure I'm prepared to ask this, but like, wouldn't
you be thinking about a share buyback at some point next year given the capital accumulation and your stock
price?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think that's a fair question to ask. I think there are a couple of things that will inform our decision. One, as
we to grow and we continue to get closer and closer to the $100 billion threshold, we have to take into account
the AOCI charge that will be applied against it. And so we want to continue to grow our CET1 ratio. Really, 11% is
the target; it's not the goal. And we expect to grow through that. All right? That's one.
And number two, you'll see the CET1 ratio moderate in the back half of the year in terms of growth, because we'll
probably step on the accelerator for loan growth once we achieve our loan to deposit ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And one of the reasons our [indiscernible] (00:28:18) so quickly is because we have really curtailed our risk
weighted asset increases, and that will tick up again as loan growth recalibrates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, we – just [indiscernible] (00:28:28) we've improved our CET1 ratio 190 basis points since we went
on this risk weighted asset diet and really paying a lot more attention to that. And we slowed our loan growth and
with our organic earnings, we were able to move that number rather quickly from a year ago, which was 8.7% to
where we are now at 10.6%.

Okay, that makes sense. It feels like there's a combination of maybe both that could be considered in the back
half of the year as the AOCI mark narrows and you get through your targets. It feels like a little bit of both. Okay.
Okay, that's fair.

No, keep going. I'm sorry. Sorry, Dale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I was just going to say, even if we're higher for longer on rates, we will see that AOCI mark decline simply
because the duration of the portfolio under five years is going to going to continue to come down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Chris, just something I'd say to you and the rest of the folks on the line; we're looking to build a very strong
foundational balance sheet here, all right, and not be sucked into any of the problems that you saw in the first
quarter with a number of banks having their duration mismatch. And we just want to never go through that again
or if we have to have it have a minimal effect on us. And that's where our intent is to continue to raise capital
levels and also to build our liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And maybe just one follow-up. I think you've talked about a mid-teens ROE through the cycle. I guess
updated thoughts on that given higher for longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think there's – so as our loan to deposit ratio continues to show kind of where we're headed, we are going
to have more high quality liquid assets. I think we can – over time, our expense ratio can fall into the 40s on an
adjusted basis. And so I think high teens works for us kind of intermediate- to longer-term.

High teens. Okay. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernard Von Gizycki of Deutsche Bank. Bernard, your line
is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yes. Hi. Good morning. So just on deposit costs, maybe I can ask it a little differently. But when you think of how
your ECR-related deposit growth based on your guidance expectations could go for 2024, if rates are steady from
here throughout 2024 versus if we do see rate cuts in the second half of 2024, how would you think the deposit
costs could migrate under those two different rate paths?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, ECRs are going to have a very high beta. They have on the way up, and we expect them to have a high
beta on the way down. And so, if we get rate cuts, we'll be able to – I think we'll be able to push those down, kind
of almost in lockstep. In addition, some of these have ECRs that are effective Fed funds plus some number of
basis points. And part of the reason why I think pressure really came on the industry overall on deposits is
because of the competition from the bond market.
So, as people are comfortable that that the FOMC is done with what whatever rate increases they're going to
contemplate, I do think that, that's going to relax some of the pressure on deposit costs for the industry kind of writ
large. And I think that may give us an opportunity to tweak some of those adjustment figures that we might have
on some of those ECRs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Dale gave you the rate size, and I'd also add, for us, we expect another 25 basis points in Q4 with several
cuts towards the back end of next year. So, deposit costs will rise and fall along with those rate cuts. But if you're
talking about total dollars, also keep in mind, if we exceed our guide, which we have in the last two quarters, you'll
see the volume aspect take hold and you'll see dollar-wise the ECRs rise. So it's going to be a little bit of a rate
volume mix as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
In addition, what Ken was alluding to earlier in terms of these deposit initiatives we have, but we think that we
have some of these will grow more quickly than what our warehouse deposits, which is kind of heavy ECR
dependent have done. And that would give us a broader distribution and more diversification on our funding
structure.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Great. And I appreciate that color. Maybe just on office CRE. I know your credit's been really good, but if look at
the 3Q exposure, I believe it increased from $2.3 billion in 2Q to $2.6 billion. Just wondering, any color you could
provide on the increase and if there is any loan sales?

Timothy R. Bruckner A

Tim Bruckner here. I can take that. Any increase would have been in-flight balance increases fund off of tenant
improvements. It'd be good news money with signed leases. We didn't increase new exposure in office.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I'll just say, as long you brought that up. Remember, 89% of our office portfolio sits in suburban locations.
Only 3% sits in central business districts. About 7% sits in midtown. And our office book represents new
construction or new vintage Class A in core submarkets. So, again, we go with experienced sponsors, proven

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think the acquisition of DDA funds in this elevated rate environment is just quite challenging. So, I mean,
the DDA that we had increase in the third quarter was kind of overwhelmingly a mortgage warehouse. And I think
that straight flat out DDA. I mean, we have had success in the regions during the quarter as well to some degree.
But I think most of the deposits we're going to be getting are going to be in either interest-bearing checking or
money market accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. That make sense. And then I wanted to talk about the shift from the held for sale loans to held for
investment, and particularly to the lot banking loans. Could you walk us through the original thought process of
designating those held for sale, and then elaborate more on the decision to bring those as held for investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Let me take that. So this was a liquidity decision, right? So in Q2, we grew our total deposits by about $3.5
billion. Here, this quarter, we grew a little over $3.2 billion. Also want to emphasize, we paid down brokered
deposits by $441 million. So, otherwise we would have grown it by $3.7 billion. And back from Q1, we put some
loans into HFS in order to be ready to create additional pools of liquidity which aren't needed. And so, we moved
these loans from HFS back into HFI.
And regarding your lot banking question that you alluded to there, generally, our lot banking programs are all on
schedule with the builders. And really the builders cannot afford to lose any of this inventory and lose control of
their for sale demand. So, again, this is segment of loans category that we like a great deal and have a very good
risk/reward attribute to it. And we've never, since we've been doing it here at the bank, suffered a loss on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey. Good morning. Just maybe, Dale, when we think about the $2 billion per quarter deposit outlook for next
year per quarter. Just talk to us the source of that deposit growth where that's coming at. And what is your
assumption around the rate at which these deposits are coming on? Is it meaningfully below SOFR? Just some
color around how we should think about that, and just how that's probably going to impact your NII NIM outlook
until rates get cut? Thanks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I'll take the first half of that and toss it over to Dale for the second half. But regarding where is the source of
the deposit strength coming from. Next year, I think you'll see – first of all, you'll see it from our traditional lines.
HOA is projected to have a good year next year. Warehouse lending/note financing generally is traditionally
strong year-after-year. The critical item there is what happens in the mortgage industry. It could accelerate a little
bit more if rates fall back and we'll see a little bit more deposit growth there.
But into next year, we are looking for a number of our newer business lines to contribute in greater sums than
they previously have, namely our settlement service business, our business escrow services business, and our
corporate trust business. Those three should have above growth rate to prior year's history here and should really
contribute.
But I'll also say that the regions – this is the second quarter in a row the regions has had very solid growth. What
we like most about the regions is they're a little more granular, okay; not big and chunky as some of the other
parts of our business. And last but not least, we've had tremendous success with our digital consumer platform,
and that has really exceeded any of our wildest imaginations in terms of the numbers we initially forecasted for it.
And that, too, will continue throughout 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The larger preponderance of the pricing that we're getting for new business ranges from the 3s and that's really in
the regions, to the 5s and that includes some of the things we talked about earlier in mortgage warehouse and
some of these other channels. I think we're going to be kind of in the middle there, weighted average something in
the 4s and I think that's probably a good target for 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And maybe, Dale, sorry if I missed it. Just in terms of your outlook, given just where
mortgage [ph] are at 8% (00:40:53), how are you thinking about what origination gain on sale fees could look like
in the absence of any rate relief?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks. I'll take that one. As we look forward Q3 to Q4, mortgage servicing income should be sustained
quarter-to-quarter, maybe even a slight growth as our MSR balances grow. In Q4, you generally have a seasonal
fall-off that happens. I think it may be a little more acute with the higher rates that we see here presently.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Sandler. Matthew, your line is
open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Thank you. Just a few questions around credit or maybe one or two here. Just, the reduction in special
mention non-accruals, can you speak to how these credits were resolved? Did most of them [ph] cure (00:42:13)
or did you push them out of the bank? Just trying to get a sense for the workout process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Yeah. Tim Bruckner again. So I'm going to take the non-accrual non-performing first. About half of the
improvement in that area is pay out or pay down, okay. The other half would be upgrade to performing categories.
With regard to special mention, we base our credit culture on early elevation. And so, we use that category very
much as a transitional category.
So as we signaled on the prior calls, we completed the portfolio review, we moved assets into that category, and
then we pressed for speedy resolutions. So, with respect to the movements in and out, those are dictated then by
our strategy, which generally involves required remargin in this environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then the other one for me around expenses. Can you speak to the investments you may still need to
make to become or be considered $100-plus-billion bank, assuming you get treated like one beforehand by the
regulators?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think the second part of that question is right on, which is most banks in our size category will start to be
treated like $100 billion bank well before you get there, and you've got to build that framework in advance. And
that framework is beginning to look and feel a little more sophisticated around capital stress testing, around
liquidity stress testing, and the framework that kind of evolves around that. As we get bigger, we'll have to make
more investments into reporting that the larger banks over $100 billion will have to do.
But we believe that starting it early and kind of building it into the run rate, because then there's going to be cost
that you're going to have to have to continue with the – not only development but the reporting and the
management and the monitoring. We're trying to build it in now and kind of build out towards that.

Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just one quick one for me. I wanted to ask on page 11 of the presentation, the earnings
at risk disclosure that you provide. In the down 100 bps scenario, the up 2.2% for earnings there, can you talk
about just your comfortability with that level? Is that where you would like the company to holistically be at, or any
changes you'd like to make to that position? And then can you also talk about what the underlying mortgage
assumptions are in the down 100 bps scenario from a gain on sale margin and volume perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, they're not dramatically different. We do think margins would increase. I mean, look at kind of what happened
during [indiscernible] (00:47:24) pandemic where margins basically tripled during that period of time. We're
comfortable with this in terms of kind of a decline and that we're a little bit better off a little tighter on net interest
income, but stronger in terms of expenses related to those ECRs as well as AmeriHome revenue. A 100-basis-
point decline is not enough to [ph] gen up (00:47:50) a meaningful refinance business, but we do think it would
help on the purchase side in terms of what we'd be seeing on volume.
And if we were down 200 basis points, we really think that that's going to open a window for a fair amount of
refinancing that's been done over, say, the past year; as well as have something close enough that you'll get
more refinance activity on a cash out basis, somebody moving from a 4% to a 6% rather than all the way up to
something in the mid- to higher-7s.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
...I mean, the volatility in deposits in Q4 is around the mortgage warehouse business, which carries most of the
ECR credits. And as that volume drops, you should see a corresponding decline in the ECR in the operating
expense line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I guess just given the seasonality in the warehouse business, how likely is it that, that $1.3 billion of
DDA growth you saw in the third quarter, how much of that actually rolls off with that seasonality next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think there's two things going on. So the growth that we had in the third quarter was a baseline improvement,
which I think that has legs and staying power. The decline we're going to see in the fourth quarter is from taxes in
insurance escrow funds explicitly. So, while that will come down in the fourth quarter, we expect to retain the
higher deposit levels kind of moving forward into 2024. So, we should see a more pronounced rebound coming
into Q1 than the decline that we see Q4.

remaining borrowings left, what's some of the higher cost borrowings that we should continue to see coming down
over the next couple of quarters? How much of that expensive borrowings are still left on balance sheet?

Yeah. As of quarter-end, we still had $0.5 billion, that is at S plus 2%. I expect that will be paid off this quarter.
And there's also a little bit of an average balance benefit because not all of the payoffs that were done in the third
quarter, they were – I'll call it ratably over the quarter. And so, some of that benefit is not recognized in the third
quarter.

And then lastly, from – Okay. And then lastly for me, just on the mention of HQLA and tying that back into the
$100 million threshold. I know you've been growing each quarter now HQLA now for a couple of quarters, but is
any of that build in relation to that $100 billion threshold? And I guess what's the remixing of the bond book look
like with additional HQLA purchases and how punitive might that be in this rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think it is all a bit related and there is maybe a gentle slope in terms of HQLA looking for kind of $100
billion number over time, which obviously [ph] we're not close to (00:52:20). But I think that's part of it. I think part
of it is as well as we pull down the loan to deposit ratio, those funds are going to be invested in something with
higher levels of liquidity like we've talked about. So, it is – I don't want to say [indiscernible] (00:52:37). That's not
a big step variable here. It's going to be a gentle climb into higher levels of high quality liquid assets over the next
couple of years.

100 basis points of rate cuts, I see NII down 4%. But clearly on the ECR side, we should see some cuts there as
well or declines there. How should we think about the PPNR impact of 100-basis-point cut in rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, if you go to PPNR, that's really going to be your earnings at risk. So, you're going to see lower levels of
expenses like you identified. But you're also going to see higher levels of revenue from AmeriHome, the mortgage

operation. And so on [ph] an EAR (00:53:51) basis, this really is we're really talking about a kind of a PPNR kind
of framework and that would tick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for that. And then shifting over to a follow-up on credit quality, you mentioned about the roughly
$2.5 billion of quarterly CRE maturities next year. Can you talk about the health of your borrowers and their ability
to withstand higher rates as these loans mature and reprice higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. So first, I think that discussion was in the context of the investment portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well it's $2.4 billion, but it was of total loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, total loans not just CRE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So our CRE is entirely floating rate one. I think that's important. And is entirely not central business districts. So,
when we underwrite an office, we underwrite suburban office. And so we've already dealt with the roll, so to
speak, because the interest rates have already come off and we've already made the grading decisions and then
we've already executed our strategy. And at this point, over 75% of that portfolio, we've either affirmed the
structure that exists or we've restructured and remargined in the present environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Thank you. So within the deposit outlook for the fourth quarter, can you give us some more details on what's
embedded about the mortgage warehouse decline? If we take the regional deposit growth of $1.5 billion and $0.8
billion digital consumer this past quarter, that would imply something like a $2 billion reduction or so in mortgage
warehouse. Does that sound reasonable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. That sounds very reasonable. So, that's what's going to happen in mortgage warehouse. And then you
would have the digital consumer platform, the regions, and some of the specialty lines picking up that flat to kind
of get us back to even. Just, I'll say this, it's kind of important. We made a strategic change with our warehouse
lending business over the last year or so where we used to have more P&I accounts which saw a lot more
volatility month-to-month, we moved more to tax and insurance accounts, right. Same clients, different liquidity
deposits.
And so, you don't see the big swings month-to-month, but you do get them towards the middle of the year and
towards the end of the year when they drop down and then have to rebuild up. So, as these balances build off,
they'll build up starting December 1 thereabouts this year, and they'll build up for the next six months going out
into 2024. So, this should have a little more stability. That's just a change that we made here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Thank you. And given how much of the ECR balances are in mortgage warehouse, is it possible that we could
see deposit costs down quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, or is that going to happen too late in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, I think you could see it down in Q4. Absolutely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And just thinking about the NIM guide of 3.6% to 3.7% against 3.67% in the third quarter, you've got the tailwinds
of the fixed loan repricing, you've got some more borrowing paydown. Seems like more tailwinds. I just wonder if
you could break out some more of the headwinds you see there that are going to stop it from elevating higher
than 3.7%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, you also saw that we had an increase in our cash position at quarter-end relative to last quarter and the
average balance for the quarter. And so, that is going to consume some of that otherwise opportunity to have a
higher yield, higher spread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. And lastly on capital, are you saying you think CET1 ratio could decline in absolute terms as you step-up
loan growth in the second half next year, or you'll just continue to grow more slowly?

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, we don't expect a decline. As I said, the target's 11% and then we'll push through that target. We just expect it
to grow at a slower pace once we cross over, cross through 11%.

David Smith Q

Are there any more inorganic levers you can pull here after like the CLN repayment, or is it a basically going to be
a function of earnings and asset growth from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

It's going to be a function of earnings and continuing to watch our risk weighted assets and making sure we
optimize that quarter-to-quarter.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I want to just to follow up, to make sure I was following the warehouse commentary correctly and the kind of piece
it together from last quarter. So, I think we were – you're up $3 billion in July during the last conference call. And it
looks like you ended up $1.6 billion this quarter. And so that came down at the end of the quarter. And then we're
expecting another $2 billion of potential runoff from there in the fourth quarter just on a seasonal kind of low point.
Am I following that math correctly, Dale?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
So, as Ken was alluding to earlier, we have – there's the escrow funds from a mortgage warehouse client are
bifurcated into two pieces. One is taxes and insurance, that's the one that we think is more attractive because it's
a little more stable profile; and the other was principal and interest. Well, principal and interest is on a monthly
cycle, but funds build up and then somewhere around the 20th, 24th of the month, they get spun out to the
government sponsored enterprises.
The other ones build up for six months, some even longer than that. And then they're paid to the taxing
authorities. So the preponderance of our portfolio comes from California. And so California taxes I think are due in
November or something like this. And so you're going to see that come down.
So, what you saw earlier was really just normal, typical behavior. And so, say, in the middle of the month, you're
going to have a higher number in principal and interest that then comes back down. So, even though that number
came down from where it was maybe in mid-July to the end of September, the actual balance trend is actually still
positive, growing, during that particular time.
We're just hitting a high point on the monthly [ph] sign wave (01:01:48) that you get on P&I payments. So, that
trend looks strong because of the balance from quarter-end to quarter-end looks good. What we're saying is the
balance from quarter-end to quarter-end for the fourth quarter is going to be down not because of P&I, which
looks good, but because of T&I and not because of client impairment; just simply because that's the cycle in terms
of how those funds are distributed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. I appreciate the clarification. And then I wanted to just ask on the spot loan yields. I think if I
remember in the slide correctly, it was 6.99% on the spot rate for the yield which I guess I wanted to relate that to
the residential portfolio. To kind of get towards that spot yield, it implies that you have to get more expansion in
that residential yield. And so how should we be thinking about residential loan yields going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I don't think residential loan yields are going to move much. I mean the CPRs on that stuff today are 5%,
kind of about the lowest anyone's ever seen. And so that's just kind of gently bleeding off. That said, this is kind of
the point on why we mentioned, hey, we have about $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion of loans, rolling off, repricing every
quarter. And so, that could come up now. A small piece of that is going to be residential, but the rest of it as well.
So if you take the residential – and those loans are again, are coming in that's something that begins with an 8%.
I mean, they're basically, look SOFR today at 3% to 3.5% of that. So, those run off and are being replaced at kind
of notably higher rates. And even the variable rate ones are being replaced at higher spreads because of maybe
uncertainty in the economy...

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. We're going to get out of the weeds here for a second. Are you signaling flat EPS for the fourth
quarter? Just, when I look at the guidance on slide 19, is that what you're signaling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we're signaling flat PPNR with some sensitivity to the gain on sale on the mortgage business,
depending on the stack up on rates that you're seeing here. That's what we're signaling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. So that's difficult for us to model. But you're saying PPNR, excluding that, it's going to be relatively
stable? Okay.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Ken – yeah, okay, okay. And then what's your level of confidence in loan growth returning in early 2024? Dale
mentioned the organic loan growth has slowed. But what's your level of confidence in getting that greater than
$500 million a quarter back in the run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, if you're talking about getting it back, say, starting in Q3 or towards the end of Q2, I'm confident about that,
yeah. We have enough channel to bring in that loan growth. I will say, subject to macroeconomic events, right.
Subject to the economy and what we see. So it's not loan growth for loan growth's sake. If we don't like the credit,
we're not lending against it. But everything being equal, we have a high degree of confidence in this company to
grow loans in excess of $500 million and loan growth will follow the deposit growth that we've laid out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Okay. How about as you look to 2024? I mean, it seems like you have a couple of quarters left, maybe one
or two left to do what you need to do on funding. I'm assuming that means that the margin starts – especially if the
Fed is done, I'm assuming that means the margin starts to lift in early 2024, which means PPNR also starts to lift
in early 2024. Am I looking at that the right way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So for us, we've got a rate increase in December which will carry into the first two quarters of 2024. At the end of
the second quarter, we have three rate decreases modeled in there the back end of the year. So you've got to
keep that in mind. But as we think about 2024 [audio gap] (01:07:39) as I said, with deposits following the $2
billion guide and loans growing at a moderate pace which is that $500 million, we see sort of the dexterity and
agility of the national business line framework and the regional growth gives us confidence in that balance sheet
construction going forward. So that's sort of what we're seeing along with stable asset quality as we go into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. I'm looking at the $8 consensus number. It feels to me like it's good. It puts you at 5 times earnings, but
your stock is down 8%. And I'm just curious if I'm missing anything when I think through your kind of medium-term
to longer-term outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'm also surprised that the stock is down 8%. We were very pleased with this quarter. And relative to other banks
that have reported, I thought we did fairly well. And we're not ready to give full 2024 guidance, but I think you can
take what we said directionally correct and model from there.
