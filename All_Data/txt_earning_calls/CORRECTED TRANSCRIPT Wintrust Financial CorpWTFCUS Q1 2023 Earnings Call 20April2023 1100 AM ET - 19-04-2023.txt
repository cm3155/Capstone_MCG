Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Thank you very much. Welcome everybody to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me are Tim Crane,
our President and CEO in waiting; David Dykstra, our Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer; Rich Murphy, our
Vice Chair and Chief Lending Officer; Kate Boege, our General Counsel, who's outside by the way, [indiscernible]
(00:01:52) but try, Kate, I'm not going to say anything bad. And Dave Stoehr, our CFO. So on a different approach
this quarter, some general comments from me, Tim will discuss operating results in detail, Dave Dykstra will
discuss other income and expense in detail, Murphy will discuss credit in detail, Tim Crane will talk about his
thoughts about the future, and back to me for some final thoughts and time for questions.
General comments, well, we've had record results, I chose the right time to semi-retire, but given the industry
challenges arose during the quarter, just like Lloyd Bridges in the movie Airplane, I picked the wrong quarter to
quit sniffing glue. Despite the turmoil in the banking industry, we had recorded record net income and PPP
earnings. The challenges we faced – that face the industry, our consistent conservative approach to banking also
thrived during the times. And as you heard me say, the concentration skill, we've always been old school and
Hollywood actors and, no, that's not changing.
I believe the current challenges in the industry open a lot of doors for us, just like in the past, industry meltdowns,
for example, Great Recession, our open door strategy result in record earnings while being one of the most
acquisitive companies in the country, pandemic, general results, [indiscernible] (00:03:22) pandemic PPP loans
were a real plus for us. There's only spillover into a ton of new clients. I think back to the Russian ruble thing, and
I always love it, smelling great because of our approach. And I expect we would continue to do the same.
Now, I'll turn over to Tim to talk about our results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Ed. Obviously, lots to talk about in terms of both the balance sheet and the recent industry
developments. It's important to note that many of my comments, as well as Rich and Dave's to come are
supported by slides that we've included in our earnings presentation that may be helpful.
First, with respect to deposits, deposits for the quarter were down 0.4% or $184 million, essentially flat in a period
where we often see some seasonal outflows. While we spent a great deal of time communicating with our clients
in the days after March 10th, and saw a significant shift in our deposit mix, which I'll discuss in a moment, our
overall level of deposits remained very stable.
In terms of additional detail, consumer deposits were actually up for the quarter, and the offset was primarily in
our CDEC group, deposits related to our 1031 real estate related exchange business. And we're down in our
wealth management area where we continue to see some movement to treasuries and the money market funds,
presumably for both rate and insurance reasons.
Except for municipal deposits, which are in almost all cases, insured or collateralized, we do not have any
significant deposit concentrations. Our average deposit account size is under $70,000. We don't have any
exposure to crypto deposit activity.
In addition, both our Federal Home Loan Bank and total overall non-deposit borrowings were unchanged in the
quarter. We didn't borrow from the Fed discount window, and have no intent to use the bank term funding facility.
During the quarter, again, we saw movement from noninterest bearing deposits to both our unique Wintrust
MaxSafe product, which provides customers up to $3.75 million in insurance for account holder, and other
3

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
reciprocal insured products. MaxSafe deposits increased by about $1 billion during the quarter, with another
several hundred million dollars, primarily larger deposits, moving to other reciprocal insured products.
Noninterest-bearing deposits at the end of the quarter represented 26% of total deposits, a return to near pre-
pandemic levels consistent with a more normal rate environment. These movements do not appear to be unique
to us, but they obviously increase the cost of deposits. For the quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs were 1.97%,
up 67 basis points. Our interest-bearing deposit beta through the first quarter was 36%. We expect the activities
post-March 10th will result in an interest-bearing deposit beta over the full cycle in excess of the 45% that we had
previously projected. Currently, we're assuming a full cycle number of approximately 50%.
At quarter end, fully insured or collateralized deposits totaled about 70% of total deposits, a number that
continues to trend higher. Loan growth for the quarter was about $370 million, on the low end of our range. Rich
will talk about loan growth, loan composition, and continued strong credit performance in just a few minutes.
With respect to the net interest margin, it was up 10 basis points to 3.83%. We're pleased with this result in light of
the late quarter pressure on deposit costs, and the negative impact of our hedging activities. While we expect
deposit cost increases and incremental mix change may continue, we believe given the current rate environment
and the continued benefit associated with the favorable repricing of our premium finance loans – as a reminder,
those were about a third of our loan book – that we'll maintain a margin of approximately 3.70% for the next
several quarters.
Given the assumptions around our balance sheet, we remain slightly asset-sensitive. An additional 25-basis-point
increase in rates if that were to occur with all else equal provide approximately $20 million in benefit in terms of
net interest income on an annualized basis. The strong earnings for the quarter produced a material increase in
our capital ratios. Total risk-based capital increased to 12.1%, CET1 to 9.2%. Both, we believe, are appropriate
on a risk-adjusted basis and should continue to expand. Tangible book value in the quarter increased materially to
$64.22 per share.
Just a quick note on securities and capital. The combined unrealized pre-tax securities losses, both available for
sale and held to maturity, at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $1.1 billion. If a regulatory rule change
occurred and we were forced to mark our entire securities portfolio, the bank would remain well-capitalized.
So despite the external volatility in the latter part of March and the prospect for evolving deposit related behavior
change, we continue to see very good pipelines and opportunities in the market and typical client activities. Dave?

David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. I'll cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories, starting with net interest
income. For the first quarter of 2023, net interest income totaled $458 million. That was an increase of $1.2 million
as compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of $158.7 million as compared to the first quarter of 2022. The
$1.2 million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the improvement
in the net interest margin that Tim talked about, partially offset by the impact of having two fewer days in the
quarter. The impact of having two fewer days relative to the fourth quarter was approximately $10 million. So in
other words, one day is worth about $5 million of net interest income to us.
The net interest margin improved 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.83%, a beneficial increase of 61 basis
points on the yield on earning assets and a 17-basis-point increase in the net free funds contribution combined
with the 68 basis point increase for the rate paid on the liabilities resulted in the improved margin. The increase in
4

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
the yield on the earning assets as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a 67-basis-point
improvement in loan yields and a higher liquidity management asset yield as the company earned higher short-
term yields on the interest-bearing deposits held at banks and its investment securities.
The increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter was
driven by a 67-basis-point increase in the rate paid on the interest-bearing deposits. It's interesting to note that
both the loan yield increase and the deposit costs increase were both 67 basis points changes during the quarter.
We continue to believe that our relatively short-term and asset-sensitive balance sheet structure can provide for
margin stability, as our premium finance portfolios, which comprise roughly a third of our loan portfolio should
continue to reprice upwards over the course of this year, which should substantially mitigate the rise in deposit
pricing.
Also, as we discussed on prior calls, the company has been entered into an interest rate derivative transaction,
specifically swap and collar contracts to protect the net interest margin in a falling rate environment. Our earnings
presentation deck has the details of those derivative positions, including terms and rates for your information.
The impact of those derivative transactions during the quarter was to limit the net interest margin expansion by 7
basis points. In other words, the net interest margin would have expanded by 17 basis points during the quarter
rather than 10 basis points if we had not entered into those contracts. We believe it is prudent in the current
environment to sacrifice some current margin expansion to mitigate a downside risk if interest rates were to
decline materially in the future.
Turning to provision for credit losses, Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $23 million in the first
quarter compared to a provision of $47.6 million on the prior quarter, and a $4.1 million provision expense
recorded in the year-ago quarter. The lower provision expense in the first quarter relative to the prior quarter was
primarily a result of less loan growth during the quarter and changes to the macroeconomic outlook related to
projected credit spreads and commercial real estate price index data.
Now, Rich Murphy will talk about credit in just a bit, but I should note that the current quarter net charge-offs and
the mix of classified loans remained relatively stable and very good and did not have a significant impact on the
level of the first quarter's provision for credit losses.
Turning to the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections, total noninterest income totaled $107.8
million in the first quarter and was up nearly $14 million when compared to the prior-quarter total of $93.8 million.
The primary reasons for the increase were due to an $8.1 million improvement in the gains and losses related to
the company's securities portfolio. The company recorded a gain of $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2023,
compared to a loss of $6.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The quarterly fluctuation was primarily
related to changes in equity valuations that affect a portion of our securities portfolio and not from sales of
securities.
A $2.4 million increase in fees on covered call options in the first quarter of 2023 relative to the prior quarter also
contributed to the increase and a $0.9 million increase in mortgage banking revenue as production margins
improved, which more than offset a slight decline in the volume of loans originated during the first quarter of the
year.
We saw mortgage application volume increase slightly during each month of the first quarter and are seeing
continued increases in loan application volume early in the second quarter, albeit still relatively small increases,
5

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
but this should provide support to the mortgage banking revenue in the second quarter. Additionally, for your
information, roughly 80% of the application volume is related to purchased home activity.
On the noninterest expense categories, noninterest expenses totaled $299.2 million in the first quarter and were
down approximately $8.7 million when compared to the prior-quarter total of $307.8 million. The primary reasons
for the decrease were due to salaries and employee benefit expenses decreasing by approximately $3.6 million in
the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Relative to the prior quarter, the current quarter
decline is primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation of approximately $9.7 million, largely
related to lower incentive compensation accruals.
The category also saw approximately $1.9 million of lower employee benefits expense due to fewer health
insurance claims during the quarter. These declines were partially offset by approximately $8.1 million of
increased salary expense, primarily due to the impact of annual merit increases that took effect in the first quarter.
Our advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 when compared to
the prior quarter. As we have discussed in previous calls, this category of expenses tends to be lower in the fourth
and the first quarters of the year. Advertising and marketing expenses are expected to increase in the second
quarter due to our marketing and sponsorship expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball
sponsorships, other summertime sponsorship events held in the communities that we serve, and marketing of our
branded deposit products.
Lending expenses also declined approximately $3.2 million due to lower overall loan origination activity
experienced in the first quarter. Offsetting these expense declines noted was a $1.9 million increase in FDIC
insurance expense, which was primarily related to the 2-basis-point increase in the assessed premiums that the
FDIC began imposing on financial institutions in 2023.
Other than those expense categories that I just discussed, all other expense categories in the aggregate were
down by approximately $1.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our efficiency ratio declined to 53%
for the first quarter from 55% in the fourth quarter of 2022, as expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate
with the increase in revenues. And our net overhead ratio was 1.49% in the first quarter and lower than the 1.63%
in the prior quarter due to slightly higher fee income and well-controlled expenses.
Looking forward, we expect fee income and noninterest expenses to increase somewhat as a result of the wealth
management acquisition, which was completed at the beginning of April. We would also expect mortgage
revenues and related expenses to increase slightly as springtime hastens the home buying season. Additionally,
as I noted earlier, the seasonal increase in marketing sponsorships will add to that expense category.
So, we anticipate slightly higher wealth management mortgage revenues and slightly higher expenses in the
future quarters. But depending on the mortgage volumes and balance sheet growth, we would still expect to
maintain a net overhead ratio in the 1.5% to 1.6% range that we have generally experienced the last two quarters.
So, with that, I'll conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance for the first quarter was very solid from a number of
perspectives. As detailed on slide 7 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $369 million or 3.8% annualized.
Loan growth was largely concentrated in two portfolios: commercial real estate, which grew by $288 million, which
6

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
was primarily draws on existing loans; and residential real estate, which was up $133 million. This rate of loan
growth is slower than what we have seen for some time and below our guidance of mid to high-single digits. We
believe this slower growth is attributable to several factors.
The first quarter is generally the slowest quarter for core loan production and is a seasonally slow quarter for the
commercial premium finance portfolio. Higher borrowing costs have forced borrowers to reconsider the
economics of new projects, business expansion, equipment purchases, and premium finance costs. And overall
business sentiment, which has dropped during the past few months.
However, we continue to see solid momentum in our core C&I and CRE pipelines. Disruptions in the banking
landscape continue to work to our benefit, as we have seen numerous quality opportunities from other regional
banks. Also, while commercial premium finance loans were down by $111 million in the first quarter, based on
historic seasonality, we would anticipate that this portfolio would show solid growth in Q2.
As noted in prior earnings call, we continue to be optimistic about loan growth in 2023, but would anticipate the
pace of growth may turn closer to the lower end of the guidance for a number of reasons. The Wintrust Life
Finance portfolio grew by $35 million during the first quarter of 2023, compared to $300 million in the first quarter
of 2022. The rapid increases in rates during the past year have significantly affected the pace of growth. We
would anticipate the slower rate of growth will continue in this high rate environment.
And increases in commercial line utilization, excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines, continue to flatten
during the first quarter, reflecting a more cautious business sentiment and higher borrowing costs. As a result,
while we continue to be diligent about and preparing for the possibility of a business recession, we believe our
diversified portfolio and position within the competitive banking landscape will allow us to grow within our
guidance of mid to high-single digits and maintain our credit discipline.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 15, we continue to see strong credit performance across
the portfolio. This can be seen a number of ways. Non-performing loans remain stable at 25 basis points or $101
million, equal to the total we saw in Q4. Overall, NPLs continue to be at historically low levels and we are still
confident about the solid credit metrics of the portfolio.
Charge-offs for the quarter were only $5.5 million or 6 basis points. And as detailed on slide 15, we saw a stable
level in our special mention and substandard loans, with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the
customer level.
Finally, as Ed mentioned, the granularity of our loan portfolio has always been a critical pillar of the Wintrust story.
This can be seen clearly on slide 7, where the portfolio has been built around commercial, CRE, premium finance,
and niche lending. Currently, commercial real estate loans comprise roughly a quarter of our portfolio. While we
closely monitor all elements of our loan portfolio, we are paying particular attention to this segment.
Higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease rates are cause for concern, particularly in the office category. On
slide 18, we have highlighted a number of important elements of our office portfolio. Currently, this portfolio totals
$1.4 billion or 13.6% of our total CRE portfolio and only 3.5% of our total loan portfolio. Of the $1.4 billion of office
exposure, close to 40% is medical office or owner occupied. The average size of a loan in the office portfolio was
only $1.3 million. We have only five loans in the portfolio above $20 million.
There has been significant concern about office properties located within the central business districts. Our CBD
exposure is limited to $358 million or approximately one quarter of the office portfolio. Half of this is in Chicago
7


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
and half of this is in other cities. The bulk of the portfolio is located in suburban areas in areas outside CBDs. And
portfolio performance today has been very good with no loans currently over 90 days past due.
We continue to perform portfolio reviews regularly in this portfolio and have stayed very engaged with our
borrowers. We are not immune from macro effects that challenges product type, but we believe our portfolio is
well-constructed, very granular, and should perform well moving forward.
As noted earlier, higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease renewals are having a meaningful effect across
the CRE space. To better understand how these issues could impact our portfolio, our CRE credit team has
performed a deep dive analysis on every loan over $2.5 million, which we'll be renewing between now and year
end.
This analysis, which covered 77% of all CRE loans maturing this year, resulted in the following: more than 60% of
these loans will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates; roughly 25% of these loans are anticipated to be
paid off or will require a short-term extension at prevailing rates; and approximately 15% of the loans will require
some additional attention, which could include a pay-down or a pledge of additional collateral. We have tentative
agreement on renewal terms with more than half of the borrowers in this final group.
Again, our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates, but we
have been diligently identifying any potential weaknesses in the portfolio and working with our borrowers to
identify the best possible outcomes.
That concludes my comments on credit, and I'll turn it back to Tim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich. Before Ed wraps up and we take a few questions, just a couple of comments. First, maybe the
events of the last three weeks of March serve as a good reminder that as much as people think of banks as a
commodity, we believe that's absolutely not the case. We continue to be uniquely positioned to take advantage of
disruption in the market. We frequently talk about that on these calls.
Relative to many of our larger peer banks, we provide a distinctly different experience. We provide a level of
service that our customers value, evidenced by the J.D. Power and Greenwich and other awards we received.
And we've stayed very disciplined with respect to credit and risk management even when some haven't. We have
a diversified mix of consumer and commercial businesses built on strong relationships.
Our model has really been all about being the best alternative to larger banks, and that opportunity continues to
exist today and in some ways more than ever. And so I'll pause there and Ed, I've got some wrap-up comments at
the end, but that's what I've got.

capacity as Chairman. Make no mistake about it, though, there's only going to be one CEO, that's going to be

to help continue this organization to go in the great growth it's had. I thank all of you for your support through the
ages. Other than the shorties out there, hope you continue to lose money on Wintrust.
I can assure you that Wintrust is in great hands. We'll continue to follow through and thrive, no matter the issue.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, it was great. Guys, I want to ask you a little bit about the margin, the 3.70% guidance. Maybe obvious, but
talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes and the factors that would drive it up or down from there. And
share with us what kind of interest rate and deposit flow assumptions that you're building into that outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Jon. It's Tim. Obviously, the deposit mix has been one of the changes that's put some pressure on
the margins. The other, as Dave mentioned, is kind of the hedging activities that we think will provide good
support for the margin in a lower rate environment. We're getting back to a DDA mix that's similar to pre-

pandemic. And so the hope is that, that migration slows, but that's certainly one of the things that we're watching
pretty carefully.
And the other is our opportunity to grow. We think we've got really nice loan opportunities in the market right now
and working hard to use our 15-charter model to grow deposits and to take advantage of some dislocation in the
market. So those would be a couple of the factors. Going forward, the hedge expense is a little bit higher in terms
of the 7 basis points goes to something like 15 basis points. But again, we think that's a prudent investment at this
point.

David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We put a deck – in the slide deck, we put a presentation about the swaps that we added during the quarter. But
since they were only on for part of the quarter, there was only a partial hit. So that 3.70% sort of includes going
from 7 to 15 basis points....

David Alan Dykstra A

...on those derivative positions. So that's part of the equation too, but we noted this last quarter, too, and I noted it
in my comments, but we still have a fair amount of asset data out there, too, to offset some of the deposit
pressure that we saw. I mean, the main decrease there is really the sort of the mix shift and then people moving
into the interest-bearing deposits from DDA. But we do have $13 billion roughly of premium financed loans that
still repriced over the course of the year. And as that repricing occurs, that will substantially offset the deposit
repricing that we expect to continue a little bit here in the future.
So we hope to hold it there, sort of where it was at the end of the quarter, a little less than we thought because of
this deposit mix, but we think we're positioned well. And as Tim said, we really think our positioning in Chicago is
wonderful. We are Chicago's bank. We win all these awards for good customer service and we get those awards
because we give good customer service. And if we go out in this environment and sell our products, we think we
can grow deposits and fund this loan growth that's out there. And there's a lot of things in the mix. but we've

always been able to manage through it before. So we think that 3.70% number we can hold and hold through the
rest of the year, assuming something really dramatic doesn't happen to the yield curve.
[indiscernible] (00:29:14)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's in the rate assumption of the forward curve. Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Pretty much, Jon. We're kind of thinking we'll get one more here at some point in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Rich, maybe for you on loan growth. Dave alluded to that as one of the keys to holding that. You talked
about slower utilization. Is that pre or post March 8? And how dramatically have things changed in terms of your
pipelines and demands since March 8? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, utilization, I think, really has been almost the entirety of the year. I mean, we've just seen that
utilization kind of just flat. We anticipated it would come up a little bit more back to more historic norms. But I think
the higher borrowing costs really have put a chill on that a little bit. Again, it's not down dramatically, but just not
recovering to the levels that we had seen historically.
In terms of overall loan demand, as I talked about, I think we have a big tailwind with our property and casualty
group because we can already see the fundings that are going to be coming here over the course of the rest of
this year. But I think the thing that is most encouraging is that our core pipeline, C&I and CRE, both are at very
good levels. And again, I'm not necessarily sure if it's the pie growing or – but my suspicion is we just continue to
see opportunities coming out of large banks, other regionals where they're just pulsing in and out of the market.
The ability to get a timely answer has really been an issue. And our teams have been very quick to respond, and
we're just seeing continued opportunity in that space. So those are the things that I would point to as being most
opportunistic about.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
As far as the – thinking about the quarter here, the interest rate hedges looks like you maybe added a couple of
here in early April, puts you close to about $6 billion in notional value. Will you go much higher than that? Do you
have a limit as to how high you want to go? Or is this sort of a – kind of like your overall strategy, take what the
market gives you here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think a little bit of the latter, David. We'll kind of see where the curve goes here. But as you can see from the
interest sensitivity slides that we include in the deck, we're getting close to the point where we're more neutral
than not. So, we think these last couple were nice adds. We caught the market at a good time and if rates start to
drift downward, we've got a little bit of insurance that will help us here. So, again, opportunistic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, you talked about the mix getting closer to where you were pre-pandemic. Now, most of the last
15 years, we've been in a zero interest rate environment outside of, what, 2018 and 2019 really. Can noninterest-
bearing deposits drop materially from here? Go back to pre-GFC. 15 years ago, the average for the industry was
12


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
almost half of what it's been since then. Can we go back that low or is there structural changes that won't allow
noninterest-bearing deposits to go down to 15% to 16% for the industry? How do you see that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think, for us, the structural change has been the growth of our commercial businesses. And so they carry
with them DDA deposits related to paying for both treasury services and excess. So I would hope that we don't go
back that low and that we've got some very material differences in terms of how we looked pre-2008 or 2010.
But clearly, the events of the second half of March have everybody to looking at their deposits very carefully. And
so, those conversations continue around the bank, but our treasury results continue to be good. So more and
more of the balances here are used to pay for treasury and other services.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty of KBW. Your line is open, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Echo the nice words towards Ed.

Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In terms of the – of course, Tim or Dave, maybe on the margin, the 3.70%, I think [indiscernible] (00:34:40) the
next couple of quarters. Maybe more a medium term question. If the forward curve plays out and you get cuts
next year, like how much downside from 3.70% do you see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, it depends on how steep you think it's going to drop, I guess. You can look at our – like our hedges,
but we think we're fairly balanced as far as our deposits on our loans go. We've really mitigated the upside and
the downside. So we give that sensitivity in the press release. But like the derivatives, if you look at that, we
probably average out in the – on the swaps in a high-3% range. And so if rates came down 150 basis points, then
those would actually start to contribute to the margin. So probably a little bit of pressure down 150 basis points,
and then after that, we hold on.
But in the prior cycle, when the pandemic hit and rates dropped dramatically, as you know, our margin fell into the
mid-2s. We think this margin would stay in the 3s. So we think we've mitigated some of that downside risk, but I
guess, it depends on the shape of the curve and the slope of it, but we're hoping to hang onto it fairly substantially
with a little bit of pressure if rates drop dramatically until the mortgage could kick back again to offset that.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Maybe just two follow-ups. I think in the past, you talked kind of high-single digit expense growth. I
appreciate the color for next quarter, but just given the changes in the environment, is that still like a reasonable
zip code for a full year? And then also, can you help us on the covered call trajectory? Obviously, you're pretty
active there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We'll have to see whether the regulators do anything dramatic that would change. But barring that, I don't
think we have a different outlook for our expense structure this year. We're pleased with this quarter. There are
some unique attributes that kept it lower like the health insurance claims were down a little bit, et cetera, but – and
mortgages are sort of at their low point as far as things go. We hope mortgages actually pick up here, which will
increase the expense base but we'll have more revenue, yeah, there, too. So that's not a bad reason for the
expenses to increase. But we still hold on to that for a full year.
There will be some increase, as I said, in the second quarter with the acquisition and the marketing and
[indiscernible] (00:37:36) health insurance claims will probably normalize, et cetera. But we sort of focus on the
net-net because as wealth goes up on the revenue side, the expenses go up, too, and as mortgages goes up on
the revenue side, expenses go up. And so it's hard to peg that expense number specifically. So we're still
targeting that net overhead ratio and it sort of takes into account the fluctuations of those revenue streams going
up and down with market conditions.
But, yeah, I don't see anything dramatically structurally changing here right now. It's really – it's the deposit cost
side of the equation that had a little bit of impact this quarter with the sort of the structural mix shift there that
happened, this whole situation sort of woke up the sleeping – hibernating bear as far as people looking at their
rates paid on deposits. And I think we've seen a substantial part of that move already. So I don't expect it to have
a similar shift this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great. And how about the covered call outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It sort of depends on where rates are at, but usually helps protect the downside rate environment as we invest.
The volatility at the beginning of this year – the covered call fee income, if you go back over time, this was a little
bit of a higher level than we'd seen over the prior four quarters. But there was higher volatility and the fee range is
based on the volume of securities that you write calls against, but also volatility. We saw much higher volatility. So
I would expect that to be down a little bit in the second quarter.
As we just said, we've been retaining a lot of those securities of liquidity just to be cautious early in the quarter. So
we'll see how it plays out the rest of the quarter. But I imagine that's down a little bit, but there'll still be some.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire of Jefferies. Please go ahead,
Casey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Just one follow-up for me. The ramp scenario that you guys highlight, credit cards down 1%. Just
curious what kind of deposit beta you guys anticipate and mix under that kind of scenario, which is obviously
pretty good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think – I'm not sure I understand the nuance of your question maybe, Casey. But we're assuming
that we're going to get probably to a 50%-ish range for the full cycle here. And so sort of depends on the timing of
those cuts. But as you can see and kind of the progression of those numbers in I want to say table 7, Dave, right,
we've narrowed our asset sensitivity position dramatically over the last four or five quarters here. So if I'm not
doing a good job answering your question, try again here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
No. That's right. So it's a similar pace on the way down as it was on the way up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Fall will be fast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. Down would be a little bit faster than on the way up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q

Yeah. Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A

...we make 1.7% on the upside under the ramp scenario, but only 1.3% on the downside. So, a little bit faster cuts
in deposit rates on the downside. I don't have the exact data for that at my fingertips, but a little bit faster.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. Just one more. I think I know the answer, but just wanted to check. With loan growth a little slower
here, any appetite for share buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We don't plan on it right now. We certainly have an appetite because we think – we all believe we're undervalued
here. But I think we'd like to see how this plays out a little bit. As Rich said, the loan growth was a little slower this
quarter, but pipelines are more higher at the end of the first quarter than they were at the end of the fourth
quarter. There's good loan demand out there.
So, we will play this out and see how that goes. We'd rather reinvest in the business and take advantage of this
disruptive market like we've done in the past, and go raise deposits, and bring in new clients and expand the
franchise. So, I think we're going to see how that plays out first. So, that's always been our goal is to grow the
franchise and take advantage of disruption.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just kind of thinking about the deposit growth outlook from here. It sounds like you guys had the nice inflows year-
to-date with the MaxSafe products. So curious how much of that occurred post the bank failures that we saw in
early March and just kind of how our deposit flows trending quarter-to-date and just kind of the overall outlook for
core deposit growth over the course of this year within the context, so maybe kind of what you're seeing in terms
16


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
of opportunities to add new relationships in the wake of some of the M&A-related disruption that we've seen in
Chicago lately?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. There were a couple of questions in there, Nate. One, with respect to MaxSafe, we were growing deposits
prior to March 10, but clearly that activity accelerated the demand for sort of insurance-related products. And
MaxSafe and the other reciprocal products that can handle even larger amounts got a lot of airtime and a lot of
popularity. So the majority of the MaxSafe growth occurred in March.
We continue to think we're really, really well-positioned, though. And so, this is the time of year we're kind of
wrestling some tax outflows as well. We think we're kind of weathering those just fine. Quarter-to-date, as Rich
kind of inferred, the loan growth is pretty good, the deposits remain stable, and we've actually paid down some of
the home loan borrowings. So, we think we're in a pretty good place here and we're very focused on growing
deposits and continuing to fund the loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of the balance sheet size from here and specifically the earning asset base, it
was kind of stable quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of a reasonable expectation to assume for the next couple of
quarters as you just take securities cash flow runoff and redeploy that into kind of mid to low-single digit loan
growth or how you guys kind of think about kind of overall earning asset growth from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. We sort of like where our securities positions are at. We would expect the balance sheet to grow. I mean,
we're going to out and market our deposit products in the communities, and our consumer deposits grew during
the quarter. And we expect that to continue to go on in the middle market space, we're strong in and with the
pipelines pull, we expect to bring in new customers. So our expectation is that we will grow the balance sheet
through deposits, and that translates into loan growth and not just run the securities portfolio down to fund that
growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:45:51) we won the J.D. Power Award again this year, three out of four years we won it. Another
eight [indiscernible] (00:46:03) awards this year, saying our products are better than the big guys. We don't have
to sell here. Plus, our positioning as local bank and, we have some real neat ideas about helping people move
their accounts. It's a pain in the neck to move your primary account. And we've got some great ideas out there
that we're instituting. And again, the charters we have, we're going to offer a teaser rate in the lower – in our
smaller locations, not cannibalize. So I think we're in great shape in that regard. We've got to go through it. We
always do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. That's helpful. And if I could just ask one more on the recently closed Rothschild acquisition, any kind
of guide rails that you guys can provide in terms of kind of the fee or expense impact. Or just kind of what you
guys expect to have in terms of the pre-tax margin from those assets and team joining?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Initially, expenses might be a little higher because – as we transition it into ours, they've got some duplicate
systems until we convert and the like. And so there'll probably be some integration expenses, but that number is
probably in the second quarter, somewhere in the $7 million to $8 million range with some of the transitional
integration costs and fees. Obviously, we will make a margin on that. We haven't disclosed what the fees are yet,
we just – I don't necessarily want to give away what our pricing is on those assets that we acquired, but I think
you can, sort of ballpark it pretty well with that background.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, is the pre-tax margin just similar to what you guys currently earn on Great Lakes Advisors, that's sound
kind of a good proxy, Dave?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would think that their business would – their asset managed business would be very, very similar to ours
and so on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Again, with the frontend implementation expense though, so a little bit of time to get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, but we can create leverage combining the systems. It was a – it's a nice add on to the assets under
management and will give us leverage. So it might take us a couple of quarters to squeeze all of the integration
stuff out, but we're very excited about the acquisition, very excited about the team that we're bringing on, and look
forward to continue to have that be a growth area for our fee income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

questioning on the Rothschild. Just on the expenses, you said $7 million to $8 million, but some of that's

transitional. I guess, could you help us think about as you – once those transitional costs are out of the run rate,
what you think the go-forward run rate specifically to Rothschild acquisition will be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
$4 million to $6-ish million, something like that. Again, we're a whole two weeks into this in terms of our
implementation activities. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. It just depends on how we grow that business. And if like – if we can grow that business more, then there's
a little bit more expense that'll go with it, but $5 million, plus or minus.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to circle back on the swaps. I appreciate the detail on
slide 22, so I can kind of try to work through that myself. But I did just want to ask if you could clarify for us, like,
how much of the – in the 3.70% margin at quarter end, how much was – were the swaps negatively impacting that
just in terms of basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's about 7 basis points. And we would project, since we added some in the first quarter, that that number would
go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. But that's 7 basis points for the full – for the quarter.

Timothy S. Crane A

Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And then I just want to ask just one last one or, well, two, just on the NIBs. You guys aren't unique in this sense
that the NIBs have been pressured. But I did just want to ask, like, do you have a good sense for like when the
tide kind of could stem there? Like, are you, kind of, close to what you would think would be the level that your
customers need to keep from an operational account perspective? Are you expecting to see more headwinds on
a noninterest bearing going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think hard to say. I mean, again, we're growing the amount of DDA deposits that are required at
the bank to pay for services, and we're adding commercial relationships. So is there going to be more migration? I
don't know. We clearly think we've talked to most of our largest clients over the last several weeks, in some cases
more than once. But it's kind of hard to say. And I don't think we're an outlier. I think we're kind of seeing what
everybody else is seeing here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, our gut would sort of say it's stabilized that there's an initial. If people paid attention to their bank
accounts all of a sudden, and realize that there's some interest bearing monies they could move away or throw
into MaxSafe or whatever.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think that we've probably seen the bulk of it. We actually think it's probably stabilized, but your guess is as good
as mine as far as what the industry may do. But we do think that they do need this base level of accounts there to
pay for fees, and operate their businesses. And that's our best guess right now is it's stabilized but.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Yeah, I understand. It's tough. And then the last one I had was just Rich, I wanted to just follow-up
on the detail you gave on the on the CRE analysis, particularly as it relates to the 25% that are anticipated to
either be paid off or require a short term extension at prevailing rate. So I think the prevailing rates part is the key,
right. Like, you obviously, you think that in the short term these borrowers could support a higher rate. But it
sounds like just the way you phrased it that you don't necessarily think these are credits that you would want on
balance sheet for – from a longer term extension standpoint. So could you help us think through what's going on
with that 25% or you say, yeah, you can afford it, but we don't necessarily think we want to keep you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think that's not the case. So those are really – it's a more construction loans, things like that where we have
financed, and have a mini perm, and long-term, fixed rate loans typically are not where we want to put a lot of
those assets, and there are better alternatives out in the market. So those – that's just part of where we fit into the
spectrum in CRE. So these are – that's what we typically see all the time.
Our runoff on CRE is substantial, so we would anticipate that that will continue to be the case. And those – these
are loans that are stabilized, and ready to go, and we anticipate that'll move out without a problem.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So it's really that last bucket, the 15% that require additional attention where you're spending more of your
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Exactly. That's our focus right now are those that because of the market dynamics we talk about rising rates and
pressured leasing activity that they're not at our required debt service coverage. And so they're going to have to
figure out how to go through paydowns, or additional collateral, or something, we're going to have to figure out a
better strategy...

Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, we're already in agreement with – of those identified loans, we've already identified, sort of, the path
forward for better than half of them. And generally speaking, because I think we are very thoughtful about client
selection, we should be able to reach agreement in the great majority, if not all.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No problem.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Rulis of D.A. Davidson.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back of the optimism on the pipeline. Could you remind us what that
actually is as you entered the quarter versus where it was at the start of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We haven't disclosed that, but generally in the past, it's been running in the last few quarters, just for
commercial and commercial real estate, not the like the premier finance, and the niche businesses there are, the
residential real estate, but just the commercial and commercial real estate. I think our growth pipelines have
generally been in the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range and I think we're more in the $1.5 billion to $1 6 billion. And
now that doesn't mean those are all going to close, that's the pipeline, and timing isn't always one year, but the
fact, I look at that more as a barometer as to how is loan demand shaping up. And so it has increased in the first
quarter.
Now, whether that all comes true or not is – I'm not saying that that's the case. But generally, our pipelines are
good indicator of demand and future closings. So up a little bit, but still relatively stable. It's not like it went from
$1.2 billion to $2.5 billion, but it inched up a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And the other thing is that, as Dave pointed out, that's of course CRE and C&I. That doesn't include the leasing
portfolio, which we've seen really good activity in so far this year. As we also talked about in the – in my
comments, the commercial premium finance group where we're seeing fairly robust growth through the rest of the
year.
So – and earlier on, somebody may have said that our guidance has changed, it hasn't changed. We just had
indicated that with a slower first quarter and just where the economy is in general, we would anticipate that it's
going to be to the mid or bottom end of that range of mid to high single digits. So just a point of clarification there.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Right. Yeah, that's helpful, those last comments. You sound optimistic. I think you're kind of maybe hedging
that a bit, just macro and a slow start. But so, again, the guidance is mid to high, and maybe you're going to hug
the mid for now, but kind of continued update is helpful. Just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And Rich mentioned this. One of the wild cards, obviously, is what our competitors are doing. And that's a little bit
hard to determine over the last month than it typically is, so just another factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yes. Fair enough. And just kind of related front, my other question just sounds like you're getting some
opportunities organically, but I wanted to check back in on the M&A side and your thoughts, obviously, a volatile
environment, but also opportunity potentially. So any thoughts on looking at whole bank or you look at more of the
like what you've done on the wealth management side? Any thoughts on the acquisition front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Right. Yeah. As you recall, the last two have been nonbank, the Wealth Management acquisition as well as about
a little over a year ago, the Allstate Agent Finance. We've talked about, a fair amount of, sort of, exploratory
activity that really hasn't turned into much because it's been tough to come to agreement with sellers. But we think
that maybe opening up a little bit here, we're getting a few more inbound phone calls, and some more exploration.
We'll continue to be opportunistic if they make sense. But we're also disciplined. And so we'll see what happens.
But probably activity kind of picking up a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I would expect it to continue to pick up as this whole cycle hits those $1 billion to $5 billion banks, and they have
lots of problems and issues, and kind of, ready to throw the towel in, and we, as Tim said, activity has picked up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And congrats, Ed, and look forward to the future. Yeah, thanks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger of Hovde Group. Your line is
open, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hi. Thanks, guys. Most of the questions have been asked and answered. So, I appreciate all the color. But I was
curious if we can just think like kind of 10,000-foot view here. Wintrust has really never had a long-term growth
problem. You guys are in perpetual growth mode, which is good. The deposits have been pretty tight to get
across the industry especially deposit loan was was going down in quantitative tightening. The cost has gone up.
So, just in general, do you have any internal red lines in terms of loan-to-deposit ratio? I mean, if growth kind of
reaccelerates, which is kind of alluded to here, where would kind of be the internal red line that we – yeah, we
need to get more deposits regardless of cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I don't know about the regardless of cost, but we think there's deposit opportunities out there. We've tried to
be pretty disciplined through this cycle as rates have moved up, and we've not gotten ahead of what we believe to
be the loan growth opportunities, but we're going to be working pretty hard on deposits. And we've said before,
we don't want to be 100% loan to deposit. We probably don't want to be 95%. So I think you'll see us working very
hard to grow deposits to try and match the loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. And then when you just think kind of economically speaking, I know you guys were a bit ahead of
the curve in terms of kind of saying that inflation is not transitory, when you guys position today, it seems like
economically we're slowing down, and the Fed is likely to probably cut sometime in the next 18 months or so. Is
there any areas that intentionally tape – break tapping in terms of growth or excuse me, loan growth or new areas
you're kind of avoiding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. I don't – I mean, Rich can chime in here too. I don't think categorically there's anything that we're saying we
either will or won't do, but we're obviously monitoring the rate impacts on our clients. And for many of them, down
is good, but we'll see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I know I agree with what Tim just said. I – one of the lines that we use a lot around here with our lenders is
we never want to be the bank that jerks the wheel. We think that ultimately that does a lot of institutional harm by
saying, we're not going to do that, we're not going to do this because it just makes [indiscernible] (01:01:57) much
more difficult to get back into it when you want to. And our general thought is just be really thoughtful about who
your sponsor is, who your customer is, what the structure of the deal is, how the deal is priced. It's just we've
been at this for a long time and we just really want to focus in on that.
There's – office is a great example. Would we do another office deal? Absolutely if it's structured the right way.
We've got the right tenant mix, and we've got the right borrower, and we got the right collateral structure. So it's
just – we are trying to be very thoughtful. I think as we talked about here, the granularity of our portfolio, and the
24


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
way it's structured allows us that flexibility. If I had a portfolio that was 50% CRE in most of that office, I feel a lot
different. But right now, we are just trying to be opportunistic, and also be really thoughtful about keeping dry
powder for our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Appreciate the color. Ed, congratulations with the great franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Tim Crane for closing remarks. Sir?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thank you very much. As I hope you can tell, we continue to think we're very well-positioned coming off
sort of atypical March timeframe here. And we're going to be working hard to grow deposits and take advantage
of the opportunities available to us. Ed's going to get mad at me, but I do want to take one second just to remind
everybody that coming off a record quarter, and well-positioned to the future is really a function of Ed's leadership.
And many of you on the call know Ed personally, and I hope as he transitions into a different role, that you'll have
a chance to catch up with him.
But in 32 years, he's turned Wintrust into Chicago and Milwaukee's bank, with several market-leading national
businesses. And he's done it in a way that's been fun for employees, good for our communities, appreciated by
our customers, and we hope rewarding for those that have been invested in our bank. So, Ed, on behalf of the
whole team, I just want to say thank you and wish you well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Tim. I'll be around.
