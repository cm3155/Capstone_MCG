All right. Let's jump into the business of the day. As we noted in this morning's press release, we were pleased
with the continued rebound in the economy from the pandemic-induced slowdown. We continue to see improved
customer activity across all sectors of the economy. Notably, while not back to pre-pandemic levels, we're seeing

improvements in the leisure and hospitality sectors. While nonaccrual and criticized loans increased from prior
quarter, loss emergence remains subdued, leading us to recognize a further moderate release from the allowance
for credit losses.
The balance sheet continues to strengthen, as both capital and liquidity grew from already elevated levels,
positioning the bank to continue to be a source of strength for our customers. We continue to make progress
towards the fourth quarter close of the People's United merger. And we were pleased with the overwhelming
shareholder support of the combination.
Looking at the results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.41 for the second
quarter of 2021, improved from $3.33 in the first quarter of 2021 and $1.74 in the second quarter of 2020. Net
income for the quarter was $458 million compared with $447 million in the linked quarter and $241 million in the
year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of
1.22% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 11.55%. This compares with rates of 1.22%
and 11.57%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets
amounting to $2 million or $0.02 per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Also included in the
quarter's results were merger-related charges of $4 million related to M&T's proposed acquisition of People's
United Financial. This amounted to $3 million after tax or $0.02 per common share. Results for this year's first
quarter included $10 million of such charges, amounting to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.06 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as
well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-
related expenses, was $463 million compared with $457 million in the linked quarter and $244 million in last year's
second quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.45 for the recent quarter, up from
$3.41 in 2021's first quarter and up from $1.76 in the second quarter of 2020.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity of 1.27% and 16.68% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.29%
and 17.05% in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release
contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Now, let's take a look at some of the underlying details in our results. Taxable equivalent net interest income was
$946 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $985 million in the linked quarter. A decrease in PPP-
related income accounted for approximately half of the quarter-over-quarter decrease in net interest income as
the first round of PPP loans continues to wind down. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 2.77%,
down 20 basis points from 2.97% in the linked quarter.
Higher levels of cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve continued to contribute pressure to the margin, which we
estimate accounted for 7 basis points of the decline from the first quarter. Lower fee amortization from the PPP
loan portfolio, both scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition from forgiven loans, contributed about 6
basis points of the margin pressure.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
The impact of interest rates, primarily lower income from our hedge program partially offset by a lower cost of
deposits, accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. All other factors accounted for some-4 basis points of
margin pressure. Compared with the first quarter of 2021, average earning assets increased by some-2%,
reflecting a 13% increase in money market placements primarily cash on deposit at the Fed and a 6% decline in
investable securities. Average loans outstanding declined just under 1% compared with the previous quarter.
Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter. Overall, commercial and
industrial loans declined by $668 million or 2.4%. Dealer floor plan loans declined by $859 million, reflecting the
well documented auto production and inventory issues experienced by the industry. Due to the late first quarter
timing of round 2 originations and delays in forgiveness of loans over $2 million in size, average PPP loans
declined by less than $50 million from the prior quarter. All other C&I loan categories grew slightly over 1%.
Commercial real estate loans declined by about 0.5%, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. We continue to
see very low levels of customer activity.
Residential real estate loans declined by 2%. We've seen little opportunity for additional buyouts of loans from
Ginnie Mae servicing pools as delinquency and payment trends continue to improve. Absent those, the ongoing
runoff of acquired Hudson City mortgage loans continues at a moderate pace. Consumer loans were up 3%,
consistent with recent quarters, as growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans has been outpacing
declines in home equity lines and loans.
On an end-of-period basis, total loans were down 2%, reflecting the same factors I just mentioned. PPP loans
totaled $4.3 billion at June 30, compared with $6.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. Average core customer
deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, and CDs over $250,000 increased
over 3% or $4 billion compared with the first quarter. That figure includes $2.6 billion of non-interest-bearing
deposits.
On an end-of-period basis, core deposits were up by just under $700 million. I'll note here that the repeal of the
prohibition of paying interest on commercial checking deposits has led us to reconsider the need for a Cayman
Islands office. It held no deposits at the end of the quarter.
Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $514 million in the second quarter, compared with
$506 million in the linked quarter. The recent quarter included $11 million of valuation losses on equity securities,
largely on our remaining holdings of GSE preferred stock, while the prior quarter included $12 million of such
valuation losses.
Mortgage banking revenues were $133 million in the recent quarter, compared with $139 million in the linked
quarter. Revenues for our residential mortgage business, including both origination and servicing activities, were
$98 million in the second quarter, compared with $107 million in the prior quarter. Lower gain on sale margins
were the primary driver of the decline. In addition, residential mortgage loans originated for sale were down about
5% to $1.2 billion compared with the first quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $35 million in the
second quarter, compared with $32 million in the linked quarter.
Trust income rose to $163 million in the recent quarter, improved from $156 million in the previous quarter. This
quarter's results included $4 million of seasonal fees arising from tax preparation work we undertake for clients as
well as the result of growth in assets under management in the wealth and institutional businesses. Service
charges on deposit accounts were $99 million, compared with $93 million in the first quarter. The primary driver of
the increase were customer payments related activity.

Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible
assets and merger-related expenses, were $859 million. The comparable figure was $907 million in the linked
quarter. Salaries and benefits declined by $62 million to $479 million from the prior quarter. Recall that the first
quarter's results included $69 million of seasonal salary and benefit cost. Our deposit insurance increased by $4
million to $18 million during the quarter, primarily reflecting higher levels of criticized loans, which factor into the
FDIC's assessment calculation.
Other costs of operations for the past quarter included an $8 million addition to the valuation allowance on our
capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Recall, there was a $9 million reversal from the allowance in 2021's first
quarter.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses
from the denominator, was 58.4% in the recent quarter, compared with 60.3% in 2021's first quarter which
included the seasonally elevated compensation costs.
Next, let's turn to credit. As I noted at the start of the call, we're pleased with the signs of spending and revenue
trends for our customers as the overall economy continues to improve. That said, some industries are improving
more rapidly than others and the supply chain issues and pressures on costs go beyond just the automotive
sector.
The allowance for credit losses declined by $61 million to $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. That
reflects a $15 million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses, combined with $46 million of net charge-
offs in the quarter. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding declined to 1.62%. That
ratio was little changed from 1.65% of loans at the end of the prior quarter.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 19 basis points for the second quarter, compared with
31 basis points in the first quarter. The allowance for credit losses at the end of the quarter reflects our
assessment of credit losses in the portfolio under the CECL loss measurement methodology, which includes our
macroeconomic forecast.
As we've previously indicated, our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest
drivers being the unemployment rate and GDP. Our forecast assumes the national unemployment rate continues
to be at elevated levels on average 5.4% through 2021, followed by a gradual improvement, reaching 3.5% by
mid-2023. The forecast assumes that GDP grows at a 7.4% annual rate during 2021, resulting in GDP returning
to pre-pandemic levels during 2022.
Non-accrual loans increased by $285 million to $2.2 billion or 2.31% of loans at the end of June. This was up from
1.97% at the end of March. We expect to disclose an increase in criticized loans with our second quarter 10-Q
filing. This reflects the prolonged recovery in certain sectors of the economy, notably hospitality and healthcare.
M&T's commercial loan grades reflect the performance of individual properties with limited consideration of
property values or guarantor ability to sustain cash flows from other sources. Notwithstanding those increases,
loss emergence on troubled loans continues to be moderate. Interest reserves are healthy, sponsors remain
supportive and collateral values are well within our underwriting assumptions. The allowance for credit losses
continues to reflect our ultimate loss expectations. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue
interest were $1.1 billion at the end of the recent quarter. And 96% of these loans were guaranteed by
government-related entities.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.7% compared with 10.4% at the end of
the first quarter and which reflects lower risk-weighted assets and earnings net of dividends. As previously noted,
while the People's United merger is pending, we don't plan to engage in any stock repurchase activity.
Now, turning to the outlook. As we reach the halfway point of the year, the cautious outlook we conveyed on the
January and April earnings calls has been well aligned with what we're actually seeing. The fiscal and monetary
stimulus programs, along with the vaccination programs, have clearly brought a turnaround in economic growth
and employment. But the downside effects from these actions continues. Excess liquidity in the system has
suppressed loan growth, particularly commercial loans for M&T in the broader industry. Customer deposits are at
all-time highs and grew faster than our ability to deploy them into assets that earn above our cost of capital. The
fundamental aspects of our outlook haven't changed.
Total loan growth, roughly flat on a year-over-year basis, excluding the PPP loans, with pressure on C&I,
especially dealer floor plan and CRE loans being offset by growth in consumer loans. Net interest income, down
low-single digit percentage from full year 2020. Low-single digit growth in total fees. We see the potential for a
slowdown in mortgage banking in the second half, offset by stronger trust income, payments-related fees and
commercial loan fees.
Expenses for the first half of the year have been mostly in line with our expectations with year-over-year growth
largely attributable to expenses directly tied to revenue growth such as Entrust and to higher corporate incentive
accruals coming as a result of improved overall profitability compared to last year. As these trends continue,
together with costs associated with the reopening of the economy and costs incurred in preparation for the
People's United merger, we expect there to be a little more pressure on expenses in the second half of 2021.
The credit environment continues to improve along with the overall economy. But some segments are recovering
more slowly than others. We're encouraged by the progress we're seeing in our hospitality portfolio with respect to
bookings and cash flows. But that sector's return to normal will lag the overall economy.
Lastly, the planned merger with People's United remains on track. And our estimated time line for approval by the
regulators, closing and integration remains unchanged. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject
to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes
in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually
unfolds in the future.
Now, let's open the call to questions. Before which, Erica will briefly review the instructions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just – if I could just follow-up on the outlook for expenses being pressured in the back half. When I look at
second quarter, we grew about 7% year-over-year. Give us a sense of how we should think about it. Like, should
back half be higher than first half levels in terms of what we saw in expenses? Any color around that would be
helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, sure. I guess, when you look at the quarter comparison in the second quarter versus second quarter last
year, that was when the economy shut down and everything stopped. So, you're in for a larger expense increase
there in that quarter, looking at a year-over-year basis. When we think about the whole year and where we'll go
for the second half, the things that we're looking at is we're looking at some increase in fee-related expenses as
we continue to see those fee categories grow. We're looking at, as I mentioned before, continued increase in our
incentive accrual based on the performance of the bank. And so, you recall that, last year, we reduced the
incentive paid to our senior folks based on the performance of the bank.
And then, the other place where you'll see some growth is as we continue to make our investments in technology
and prepare for the People's integration. So, we'll probably see some expense pressure in the third quarter. We'll
call out what's related specifically to the merger because some of those will either be onetime or they could, in
fact, be expenses that will start maybe a quarter earlier than we might have thought as we prepare for the – for
legal day one and for the conversion.
But overall, the expense growth that we saw this quarter, we wouldn't be running at that high of a rate for the
whole year, certainly not excluding the impact of the People's merger. I'd be thinking more in the, I don't know, 3%
to 5%, taking into account the corporate incentives as well as the growth in some of the fee businesses.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, just on a separate topic. René, last quarter, you provided some color around
the hospitality book. I'm just wondering if you've seen any improvement in terms of the debt servicing for these
borrowers. And I understand you don't expect credit losses stemming from this portfolio. But how will that inform

your ability to get back to sort of [ph] season (00:23:22) on reserve levels as you think about the next few
quarters? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, sure. I guess, the way we're looking at it and thinking about it is, when we look at the criticized portfolio,
we're really focusing on the stand-alone cash flows of each of the properties in each of the – each of those
specific, I guess call it, pieces of collateral because, with many of our relationships, our clients will have multiple
properties. And so, we look at each property and we assess its ability to cash flow. And that's what affects the
criticized balances. When you look at actual losses, just because they're struggling, many of them are actually still
earning interest and accruing interest because the sponsors have outside sources that they're bringing to support
the deals.
And then, the other thing we're looking at is we keep getting updated appraisals on loans and properties that we
have both in criticized and particularly in nonaccrual. And what's been a pleasant surprise is, when we look at the
recent approval – appraisals that have come in, they've been very strong. We've seen valuations that I believe
were on a fully as is basis that are above – well above our loan cost and on a stabilized basis that are maybe
down 10% from the original appraisals.
And so, when we think about the loss content in the portfolio, which is reflected in our allowance, we feel quite
comfortable with what's there. The question, obviously, will be the timing on when the cash flows get to a point
where we would see them as not criticized any longer. We are seeing improvements in occupancy rates in the
hotel portfolio across the board. But we're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels there mainly because business
travel hasn't resumed or seeing good performance in leisure travel, but not as strong yet in business. And so, as
those vacancy rates come down and revenue per available night – or available room comes up, we'll see those
assets go from criticized back into performing. And then, that will support further reductions in the allowance.

Actually, I'd love to stay on the whole reserve question – or topic for just a second more. Obviously, you – the
amount of reserves that you released this quarter is very small, I mean, certainly relative to what we've seen at a
number of other banks. I know you can't necessarily comment on how you differ from other banks or – but I am

kind of curious, any color you have on – like, what assumptions that you're making that might explain the
differences in your – sort of your limited reserve release versus everyone else? Or maybe it's not assumptions at
all. It really is like this big criticized portfolio that you're talking about. Any color would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. No. Happy to go into some of the details there. I guess, a couple of broad thoughts to start. The CECL
methodology is a lot more penal on consumer books than on commercial books because they tend to be longer
dated. And our institution, as you are aware, skews more commercial. That's one. It also is – has a big impact on
credit card portfolios. And credit card at M&T is not a huge part of our book of business. And so, when you look at
some of what was being done last year in reserving, what you saw was much larger additions to allowance than
you would have seen at M&T because of those mix differences. And so, now, when we're going in the other
direction, the releases are also higher for those same reasons.
And so, when you look inside our portfolio – and just to give you a little flavor on the allowance, it's obviously – it's
a collection of the different asset classes and the loss expectations in those assets. And so, if you think about
C&I, the C&I provision, there was a little bit of a release or recapture because there was a decrease in the loans
outstanding because of the auto floor plan, right? And so, that was as much a function of a decrease in assets as
it was the loss rate on the assets.
Within the real estate portfolio, we continue to have a loss assumption that's pretty much unchanged. And there
was a slight uptick there because of the increase in – or the size of the criticized portfolio. If you look in the
mortgage book, it was a decrease, again, because of the reduction in the assets as well as the continued great
performance of home prices, which affect the model and the loss expectations. And so, there was a decrease
there.
And then, in the other consumer portfolio, it was actually an increase because of the growth in balances offset a
little bit by strong used car prices, which brought the loss rate down a little bit. And so, there's different pieces in
each of the portfolios that will move the allowance either up or down. It could be because of economic factors. It
could be because of the balance. But those are some of the dynamics that are happening underneath. And
hopefully, that helps give a little bit more color to what's happening with the allowance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
It does. That's perfect. Thank you. And then, just maybe a follow-up question. In terms of the securities portfolio, I
certainly understand your rationale for not wanting to invest in very low yielding securities at this point. At what
point might that change or – and how low could the securities portfolio go before you feel like you need to invest
at least something? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, sure. I was waiting for this conversation. I got to listen to René last time on the same subject. When you
look at where we sit today, I'll talk about the securities portfolio, but also just some of the other parts of the bank.
We just talked about the reserve and where the reserve sits, relative to CECL, day one.
When we look at our underwriting and our losses or expectations, to me, we are adequately reserved, if not
maybe a little bit more, and that's future potential. You look at our capital ratios at 10.7%. We're probably going to

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
print near the high of the peers in terms of that ratio. And we'll hold on to that until we do the merger. That's
untapped potential. And I see the securities portfolio the same way. And so, we've been allowing that to run off. I
think what we'll – you'll start to see is as we start to think about maintaining it where it is and then look as we
prepare to merge with People's.
And if you – what's on our mind as we think about how and when to deploy that excess cash, it's a combination of
just replacing some of the cash with securities in our own book but what the combined balance sheet is going to
look like. And so, People's will bring a higher percentage of securities and cash, which will balance us out a little
bit. And they'll also bring a bigger on-balance sheet consumer mortgage portfolio as a percentage of their assets
because they've tended to be an originate-and-hold shop where we've been an originate-and-sell.
And so, the combination of those two factors when we combine the portfolios will start to bring down some of our
asset sensitivity. And based on that combined portfolio, we'll start to think about how we want to deploy that cash
into what types of securities and what type of durations we might want to add. So it could be through the
securities portfolio itself with mortgage backs, it could be just retaining mortgages and getting the same exposure,
but having it on the balance sheet in an HTM as opposed to an AFS type of portfolio.
And so, those are the things that we're looking at. And we'll look to do other things we can to optimize the cash,
looking to reduce borrowings. We'll continue to reduce time deposits, which will get some additional ones with
People's. But I think, as we look forward, our belief is that the deposits are probably going to stick around a little
bit longer than we might have anticipated, which is affecting our thinking about deploying and the duration that we
want to assume and what percentage of the cash we want to put to work. But I think we're probably at a point
where we start to see that securities portfolio level off. And we'll be selective about jumping in, but we'll probably
keep it roughly where it is.

Just a question on the margin front. Wanted to see if you can – baked into your net interest income expectation
for a low-single digit decline in 2021, how should we think about margin trajectory underlying that going forward
from here? Obviously, on an underlying basis, clearly, the People's deal would impact that, but wanted to see if
you can elaborate a little bit on the stand-alone margin expectation? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. It's a tricky one, John. And so, when I think about the net interest income, the reason I've been explicit and
we've been explicit about talking about that dollar number, as opposed to the margin, is there's a lot of things that
are going to bounce the margin around that don't affect the dollars, right? So first and foremost is cash. And we're
still in a place where each extra $1 billion of cash compresses the margin by 2 to 3 basis points, but it actually
adds a nominal amount to net interest income.
The other thing that bounces the net interest margin around is just the pace of forgiveness on the PPP loans. And
when you look at the first – or the last four quarters, we've really seen the bulk of Round 1 PPP loans forgiven.
And so, when you accelerate that origination fee, obviously, that affects the net interest income and the margin,
but isn't necessarily repeatable.
And so, when we think about the full year guide for net interest income down low-single digit, factored in there is
the earning assets, which we've talked about where we think those will be. And if you go underneath and look at
the actual loan spreads and deposit costs, those are pretty stable. And that portfolio is producing a pretty stable
stream of net interest income. And the movements are generally caused certainly in the NIM by cash, by the pace
of PPP and then, ultimately, the hedge portfolio that we've talked about, I think, for several quarters now that it's
out there.
The notional amount outstanding hasn't changed. It's still around $17.5 billion. But the effective yield is coming
down each quarter. And so, that will put a little bit of pressure on the net interest margin and, ultimately, net
interest income. But as I at least look through the next couple quarters on a stand-alone basis, I think net interest
income is roughly around where it was this quarter.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Not a Bills fan, but got to acknowledge it. And then, just separately, on the loan growth outlook for the relatively
flat expectation for the year, can you just talk about when do you see an inflection in balances as we look over the
next couple quarters? Is an inflection – in the near term, can you see an inflection in the back half as consumer
offsets the continued declines in C&I and CRE?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think you'll start to see it, but it's going to be nuanced and it's not going to be obvious. And the reason it's
going to be that way is there's two portfolios that we have that are going to cause a top line decrease in loans. So
first and foremost is PPP, which is well documented, right? And we know we've got now $4.3 billion at the end of
the quarter that's going to run off and will depend on the pace of forgiveness. But there's reason to believe that

that will happen in the next three or four quarters. And then there's also the Ginnie Mae buyouts that we've added
on to the balance sheet to use up some of that excess liquidity because we like the duration and the yield on that.
And as the economy continues to improve, it's our expectation that we will actually – those will become
reperforming and they will get packaged and sold back as securities. And that will bring down those mortgage
balances, but obviously will drive some fee income.
And so, when you look underneath the portfolio, back to some of the trends that we had talked about, ex-floor
plan, C&I was actually up modestly and we did see a very slight uptick in utilization rates of C&I lines in the
quarter. And we will see production come back in the auto sector, and we'll see some of those floor plan balances
growing again.
Just for context, our current line utilization in the – or in the auto floor plan space is about half of its long-term
average. And so, that by itself is worth a couple billion dollars. And so, we'll see that start to come back. We think
it will be really first quarter of next year.
And then, when you look in the real estate space, not surprisingly, there's not a lot of activity going on. And,
usually, what drives some of the CRE growth and declines is just activity in assets changing hands. And when
that happens is both a positive and a negative, we see payoffs because some of our clients sell. But we also gain
assets when construction projects come online or come due and/or when our clients are out looking at assets and
growing their portfolios.
And so, right now, that's pretty subdued and expect that the CRE balances will be kind of flattish, maybe slightly
down as we work our way through. And then, the big growth is in the consumer portfolio. When I say big, that
sounds more grandiose than it is. It's consistent growth in the auto floor plan – or auto indirect as well as recfi and
– auto and recfi, sorry.
So it's there. I like the trends that we see. The spreads are still holding up. The returns in the business we're
booking are solid. And so, we don't feel a need to chase it but need to be there to support our clients with what
their activities are. And it will largely reflect the economy.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Darren, wanted to follow up and ask – to a point about the eventual resecuritizations on the Ginnie Maes, I was
wondering if you could just help us understand how big is that book in the loan book now? And if you're fee guide
for down low-single digit contemplates getting some of that resecuritization income back into fees this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, if you look at the Ginnie Mae portfolio, let's call it, $3.5 billion to $4 billion, that will ultimately get
resecuritized and sold. The pace is a little bit unknown right now. As the foreclosure moratoriums keep getting
extended, that gets pushed out. When we gave the original guide about fee growth in low-single digits that
contemplated some degree of gain on sale coming from that portfolio, that's been pushed out a little bit. One of
the things that happens on the other side, though, is as long as those assets sit on our balance sheet, we're
accruing interest income. And so, that's helping with the net interest income.
And when we look at the potential gain on sale, it will move the percentage growth in fee income maybe a
percentage point and it would be towards the fourth quarter of the year, not likely much before then, just given
what we're seeing and the time it takes to get those securities considered reperforming and available for sale. So,
it will be back-end loaded and start to spill into 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. Understood. And just a follow-up question. It's great to see the Trust business continuing to rebound up
another 4%. I'm just wondering. Can you just talk through just some of the underlying growth drivers in Trust? And
do you have the – what the fee waivers were this quarter and if you expect that those would have peaked and
maybe we get a little bit of held back on those going forward, given the IOER changes? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Let me make sure I got all these. So, I'll start with Trust and then I'll talk about the waivers. So, we're really
pleased with how things are progressing in the Trust business. There's really two main drivers of the Trust fee
income in the last few quarters. Our wealth team has really done a great job with leveraging the changes that they
made to their platform to be out and growing new customers, which is very encouraging. And then, for the existing
customers plus the new ones, everybody is benefiting from the capital markets and the growth there.
And another piece of our Trust business is we manage assets on behalf of retirement plans. And as we manage
those assets, it's a great business because, each month, employees contribute more to their plan. We're signing

up new employers and the market's been growing. And so, the combination of those three things is driving growth
in assets under management, which is leading to top line.
Keep in mind. This is where I say we're seeing expense growth that, in many cases, we're a fiduciary of those.
We're not the underlying asset manager. And so, there's a sub-adviser fee that doesn't get netted against the
Trust fee income. It's in the other expense line. And so, as we grow those assets under management, we like the
returns in that business. And we like the profit it adds. But it does cause expenses to go up at the same time. And
so, that's why we want to say there's expense growth related to fee growth. That's one of the big drivers.
When we look at the waivers in the funds, it's in the neighborhood of, call it, at the high end, $15 million a quarter
is where we are today. And what it will take to get back in there, we probably need – I think we need Fed funds up
probably closer to 50 basis points before you see that start to materialize as opposed to the first 25. So, this
would be another one of these things when I look forward and I think about what the potential is for the bank in
addition to the things we talked about with cash and capital and the provision, obviously, the waivers is another
one that can turn around. So, lots of latent potential. We just need to unlock it.

As PPP balances wind down, is there an opportunity to grow your small business lending into other markets
outside of your traditional footprint, perhaps by partnering with other financial technology players or doing a bolt-
on type deal like we've seen from others? More broadly, the question is, I guess, just any color that you can give
on the extent to which you're considering these kinds of moves across any of your business lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. And great question. Small business is one of the cornerstones of M&T and who we've been for years in the
communities that we serve. I think the number one opportunity that sits in front of us is People's. We mentioned it
on the announcement of the deal. And the more we get to know our new colleagues at People's and the
geographies, we continue to be excited about the upside there and that bringing our brand of small business
banking to that franchise is really exciting. And we have been watching with great interest what's been happening
with nationwide small business lending. And I have the benefit of – I used to actually run that division in a prior
career here at M&T. And we've seen people come in and out of that business a lot.

And one of the things that always excited me in that business was when People's announced they were getting in
because it's tough. And one of the things that's really important to remember about small business is that small
business loans are okay business, but the real value is in the deposits. And the small business franchise is
actually self-funding. And so, one of the tricks – and when you talk about nationwide small business lending, what
we're watching is not the ability to give out money because that's easy, but the ability to make sure that you risk
rate it, that you take care of fraud which we saw some fraud in some of the PPP situations and then ultimately
your ability to win the whole relationship.
And so, if you think about M&T and our approach to banking, it's always been full relationship banking. And one of
the keys is having – we've always talked about the operating account of our customers, whether it's consumers,
whether it's small business or middle-market companies. And that's a little bit of a tougher proposition on a
nationwide and remote basis. But it's something that we watch. And fortunately, we had a very strong PPP
showing. And we were able to win some new relationships in our footprint. And for now, I think we'll focus
primarily on capturing the upside that we see in the new markets that come with the People's combination.

I thought for a minute they just dropped me off with that long delay, but I'm glad you picked up. A couple of
questions for you. We all – and you referenced it in your prepared remarks about floor plan lending and what's
going on in the auto industry and the supply issues in other industries as well. The question is this. Autos in
particular, you won – there are some stories that have been written recently that maybe the auto dealers may
follow what they're doing today into the future, meaning keeping a lower inventory and having higher margins. So,
maybe they sell fewer units, but the margins are higher – that may be a way to go. Are you hearing anything like
that from your guys on the front line who deal with the auto dealers that the normal inventory levels and the
normal floor plan lending will come back or maybe it will not come back?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Gerard, it's a great question and it's one that comes up often. It tends to come up a little bit more in other
business circles than with the dealers. I mean, they obviously – they love the situation that we're in right now
because of the – how quickly the cars are moving off the lot. The thing that you got to keep in mind especially as it
relates to the auto business is a lot of the production is pushed by the manufacturer. And while we do a lot of floor
plan with the dealers, generally, the new car production is floored by the manufacturer. And the manufacturer will
actually have incentives and will buy back cars that don't sell. And so, there's what's on the dealer's lot and what
they'd like to do and then there's what the manufacturing industry or part of the value chain wants to do.
And I think the last SAR, if my memory is correct, printed around $15 million and it averaged about $17 million
pre-pandemic. And so, that's a lot of production that's not there right now. And one of the other elements of the
production that happens is it goes from the manufacturer to the dealer and some of the unused inventory ends up
in rental agencies. And obviously, that was an industry that early on was hit pretty hard by the pandemic but
seems to be coming back. At least, if any of you have tried to rent a car lately, you'll find, one, it's difficult; and,
two, it's really expensive.
And so, I think as some of that production comes back, you'll see it move its way through the lots and back into
the rental car companies. So, probably more insight or information than you wanted in the response. But I don't
think it will stay this way because I think there are other forces at play that are unique to auto. It's a different world
in refi, where the manufacturers don't have that same power and the dealers themselves have more control over
inventory and the lots. And obviously, that sector has been through a big change through the pandemic as well.
But I think we will see a rebound in auto floor plan lines. Will they get usage – I should say, will they get all the
way back to where they were? I guess that remains to be seen. But it will be a function I think of the ability of the
manufactures to ramp up production.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. I appreciate the insights. Coming back to your comments about your average balance sheet and you
talked about the deposits at the Fed, your securities, et cetera. I don't know if you're able to do this. But when you
look at your spread, I think this quarter was 2.71%. Your margin was, of course, 2.77%. And you look at the
different categories of asset yields. How far away is the current market, your incremental loan that you make or
the incremental security that you purchased to the actual averages that you're showing in the third quarter? Is it a
10, 20 or 30 basis point difference on the incremental new asset production versus what your averages are
showing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, when you look at – when I look at roll-on and roll-off margins, what we've seen for probably the last six to nine
months is roll-on margins have been better than roll-off margins. And so, that bodes well for the portfolio over the
long run. But what we've also been seeing in the last few quarters is the spread or, call it, abnormal spread, I don't
know, is coming back closer to what it was pre-pandemic. And so, you'll see over time spread which is really the
piece that matters to most of us coming back to pre-pandemic levels, but hopefully not below. But in the last little
while, what we've seen is roll-on better than roll-off.

I'm cautioning a little bit because when I think about the press release and I think about the page in the press
release that talks about yield and particularly on C&I, there's a lot of movement in there right now because that's
where all the PPP fees are rolling in and out of. And so, that's why we're getting some wild swings in margin
there. And then, when we look at the CRE yield, that's where some of the hedge would be.
But when you take all that stuff away and just look at what's actually in the portfolio, the yields and – I'm sorry, the
spreads over the last year have been a little bit better than what they were going into the pandemic. They're
trending back there. And so, I would think that, over time, our long-term average yield or spread would be similar
to what it was pre-pandemic. And as we start to deploy some of that cash, hopefully, into things other than
securities in – but into supporting customers, that we continue to see a net interest margin that in the long run
prints in the top quartile of the peers as has been our history.

Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. So my questions are tech-related. So what's your outlook for your tech budget over the next, say,
three to five years? In the past, you said tech cost is around low-double digits of revenues. But given the
challenging rate environment and the pending People's deal, I was just wondering what you think it will be post-
merger. And then what are the incremental investments in light of the comments you had for the second quarter?
And then as a follow-up, I'll just give that now, what's the mix of this budget in terms of run versus change the
bank? Before the pandemic, we kind of estimated it was around 60-40 as you focused on reducing customer
friction and improving processes. Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Okay. So, I guess, I'll just start with what we saw in quarter-over-quarter. When we look in that software and data
processing line, there's two elements there. One is contracts that we have where we pay a fee based on volume.
And so, as some of the data processing volumes increase, so will that fee. And that's one of the drivers.
And then the other one in there is software licenses. And what we tend to find is the first quarter is a little bit light
on that and it tends to catch up as the year goes on. Some of the licenses will grow as we prepare for People's
because we'll be buying additional licenses for the People's employees, whether it's for commercial loan, RMs,
whether it's for the branches or staff employees. And you might see that a little bit in advance of the merger. And
those would not be considered one-time expenses, but they would have been contemplated in our due diligence.
And so, you'll see some of that.
And then the other thing that happens is, as you shift more of your technology into ASP or cloud-based
environment that you pay more in kind of monthly or quarterly fees versus the upfront investment cost. And so, it's
a little bit of a shift. And so, that impacts the growth of the overall tech budget, right, that you'll have a higher tech
budget if you're kind of building your own software versus buying off-the-shelf. The difference is it costs you a little
bit less upfront, but then you've got the tail of the ongoing software licensing costs.
And so, when we look at our tech budget and how it's grown over the last several years, it's been high-single digit
compound annual growth rates. When you look over the last five years, there's times when it moves up and we
invest a little bit more, and times when it levels off. But I think that's a pretty good estimate of where we've been
and likely where we're going.
And the focus is across build the bank and run the bank. It's 60-40. I think that's a good number and way to think
about it. Whether it's 60-40 run versus 60-40 improve or build can shift in time. Some of the things that you're
investing in or we're investing in include data, data quality, data warehousing, cybersecurity, risk management
things which, I guess, are build the bank, but could be considered run the bank, depending on how you qualify
them. But they're just part of being a larger institution.
As we've noted, we're focused on things that improve the customer experience, whether it's been the mobile app,
whether it's been improving the interactions that happen in the call center, whether it's providing better technology
to the branch teams. We made some big upgrades to our cash management system, we've made big upgrades to
our loan origination systems to try and help the commercial RMs and make their lives easier.
And so, it's across those types of investments that you're seeing us spend our dollars. And I think tech budgets
are just part of banking. They're going to be there. It's hard to separate technology from banking these days. But
that doesn't mean it's the only part of banking, as we'll reemphasize that we've always been a bank in our
communities where our folks and the personal touch and relationship management matters and the technology is
there to complement that approach and to make our teams that much more effective with clients.

Yeah. Just a quick one on capital. I know this may be a better question for the next earnings call. But just given
what you're seeing today and your higher capital levels, do you think you'll be in a good position to get a lot more
aggressive with the buyback once you close the deal? The capital ratios will still be pretty robust at that point, so
just curious if you're looking to get more aggressive following the close?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I guess, I would – more aggressive, that gives me a little bit of agita, but we certainly are – will be –
continue to be active and prudent stewards of capital. My first hope is that we go back to the conversation we
were having before about loan growth and that we continue to grow customers and grow balances, and we use
that capital to deploy it for – in the sake of our customers.
That said, when you look at the things in front of us with, hopefully, deploying some of that cash and seeing some
releases of provision and get the synergies, the cost savings out of the merger, we're going to be creating more
capital. And that gives us a great opportunity to go and do buybacks.
And so, we'll go through and put the two banks together. We'll put our forecast of loan growth together and uses
of that capital. We'll consider the dividend and where that is within our capital governance. And then, what we
can't deploy effectively, we'll give it back to you guys. And so, I think, just based on where I sit and where our
ratios are right now, it's safe to say that capital deployment will be in our future.

Would you say that the chances are better than not that you wrap up the buyback that you have out there by
CCAR next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, since we announced the buyback in January and we got approval from the board, but we didn't actually use
it because we announced the deal.

And so, I don't think we could use that whole thing up before CCAR next year because we'll be submitting that in
April of next year. And so, between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, to be able to use up that whole
allotment would be pretty difficult, but we'll – go ahead.

I was just thinking through the first half of next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Even through the first half, that would start to get tough. But like I said, we'll be back to you guys with some more
detailed thoughts on capital deployment as we get through legal day one and get the two banks put together, at
least, on paper and we can get a look at the balance sheet and confirm the forecast. But I think it's definitely safe
to say, as I mentioned before, that a ramp-up in the rate of capital deployment compared to certainly in the last
few years is in front of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

Sounds good. Maybe just one quick one on expenses, you guys addressed this a little bit earlier. But just trying to
tie this back to the guidance you gave earlier this year for flat to less than up 1% expense growth for the year, ex
the deal. I know you factored in some fee growth into that guidance as well. Are you still thinking that that
guidance works at this point, ex the deal? Or has the revenue performance been better than what you thought at
that point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. I guess, I think there's a couple of things. Some of the revenue performance has been a little bit better. And
then, it's more overall bank performance has been better, right? So, when we were contemplating our accruals for
incentives at the start of the year, we were expecting not as quick a rebound in the economy and maybe a little bit
higher charge-offs than what we're actually experiencing. And so, as we work through the year and we see better
performance at the bank, we tend to set our accruals as a percentage of the bank's net income. And as the net
income is increasing, we're accruing a higher amount for incentives. And so, if you go back to that original guide
of flat to 1%, ex the People's and the other things, we're probably more going to run 1% to 2%, ex the People's
deal.

Okay. Great. And one last one on deposits. I hear you loud and clear when you say you're expecting deposits to
stick around for a while. But I was just curious if you've seen any increased spending, whether it's amongst
consumer customers or business customers of deposits in recent months. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting to see the deposits. We are seeing people spending but it's not seeing – we're not – it's not
showing up as a decrease in the balances. What's interesting is I've started to get back out again as we reopen
the economy. And lucky for Gerard's question, I had spent some time with some of our dealers, but a couple of

our other customers and they had received PPP loans. And I'm going somewhere with this because it was
interesting to me that they had just gotten forgiven. And I said, oh, well, what are you going to do with them? Do
you have the money left? And they said, we have every cent still. And I said, why? You got that to pay for these
expenses. And they said, oh, we did that out of our normal cash flow. We just adjusted our operations.
We didn't want to spend the money until we actually had the loan forgiven in case we didn't get it forgiven. And
so, that gives you a little bit of an insight into some of the mindset of the type of customers that we have, one; but,
two, that those dollars are still sitting there and available to be spent. And so, I think we'll start to see those move.
But we need to continue to see movement in the economy. And from any of the customers that I've spent time
with and talked to, there's obviously some supply chain challenges in certain sectors.
The biggest supply issue is talent and available workers. And I think that's the next thing to go is to get more folks
back on the employment rules and then we'll start to see I think some more of that spending and demand for the
cash out of both the consumer and the business deposit accounts.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Hi, Darren. Welcome back.

Hi, Peter. Thank you.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Just two quick housekeeping questions. Last quarter, René mentioned that there was about $90 million in swap
income. And I was just wondering what it was in the second quarter and maybe the outlook for the second half of
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. You said you had a couple. Is that your only question? Or do you have another one?

Well, I – just the other on PPP...

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
How much is left in terms of amortized fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, in swap income for the quarter, it was down about $14 million. And as we mentioned I think a couple of calls
ago that the total for the year was going to be closer to – for 2021, close to what it was in 2020 but kind of peaking
in the fourth quarter last year, first quarter of this year and then declining each quarter from there. It looks like they
will be down, kind of, round numbers, call it, $10 million a quarter. The rest of the way, this was a bigger quarter,
just because of the nature of some of the swaps that went on and off, but no change to that guide.
And when we look at PPP, we look at PPP round one, the bulk of the origination fee has now gone through and
been captured in the income statement and through net interest income. But PPP round two, while the
forgiveness portals are open. We haven't really recognized any forgiveness on those yet. And so the whole
second round of balances and the origination fees associated with them are still hanging out there. And round
numbers emphasize around maybe $100 million of income to come in. And hopefully, we'll start to see it in the
next quarter. But the good news with it is it either amortizes in every month or it accelerates. But you don't lose it.
And so, that's out there and that's also factored into our guide about net interest income being down low-single
digits year-over-year.

Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Darren.
