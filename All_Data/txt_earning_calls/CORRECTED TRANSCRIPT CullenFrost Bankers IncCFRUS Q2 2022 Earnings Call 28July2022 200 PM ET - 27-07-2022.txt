Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. I'll review the second quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will provide additional comments, and then we'll open it
up for your questions.
In the second quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $117.4 million or $1.81 a share, compared with earnings of $116.4
million or $1.80 a share reported in the same quarter last year, and $97.4 million or $1.50 a share in the first
quarter of this year. Our return on average assets and average common equity in the second quarter was 0.92%
and 13.88%, respectively.
These results in our overall growth show that our company is well-positioned to succeed in what's been an
unusual and evolving environment. Our loan growth was strong. Average loans, excluding PPP, in the second
quarter were $16.5 billion or 13.2% higher than the average loans of $14.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021. It
was good to see our growth exceeded our typical goal of high-single-digit increases.
In the second quarter, we booked 28% more loan commitments than the same period last year. All segments
were strong, with C&I up 25%, CRE up 37%, and consumer up 31%. In addition, we saw new loan opportunities
continue to increase. They increased 10% from a year ago and increased and un-annualized 9% on a linked
quarter basis. So the overall flow is good.
Looking at our weighted 90-day pipeline, it was up 9% from a year ago. On linked quarter basis, it's fairly flat,
down 2%, as increases in commercial and consumer segments offset a reduction in the near-term pipeline for
commercial real estate. Average deposits in the second quarter were $44.7 billion, an increase of 16.9%
compared with the second quarter of last year.
And as much as we focus on loan growth, we were very pleased with our growth in deposits because it's through
deposits that we build long-term relationships as we offer attractive value propositions that customers can trust.
Growth in our consumer business continues to be strong. Our net addition of 7,242 consumer households in the
second quarter was an all-time high for us and represented an 8% increase from the same period a year ago.
Consumer loan growth was also strong on a linked-quarter annualized basis. Average consumer loans grew by
20.6%, led by increases in consumer real estate. Our success here was driven by our HELOC, home equity, and
home improvement products. Also, our pipeline for these loans continues at record levels.
Now, regarding our expansion efforts, in Houston, we see the momentum continuing as newly opened branches
mature. At the end of the second quarter, we stood at 109% of deposit goal, 122% of new household goal, and
185% of our loan goal. Our Dallas expansion is admittedly in its very early innings. However, I'm encouraged that
the preliminary results are similar to our Houston success with 165% of deposit goal, 220% of loan goal, and
235% of new household goal. We're making excellent progress towards launching our mortgage product. And we
expect to begin a pilot program toward the end of this year. And as you know, we're designing the entire process,
from start to finish, to originate and service mortgage loans, in keeping with the great Frost customer experience.
Despite uncertainty about the broader economy, we've seen no signs of increasing loan delinquency. Our overall
credit quality remains good. The June 30 total for delinquencies, excluding PPP, was $61.4 million or 37 basis
points of total loans. Total problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, totaled $429 million at the
end of the second quarter, and that was down from $447 million at the end of the previous quarter. Once again,
we did not report a credit loss expense in the second quarter and net charge-offs for the second quarter were
$2.8 million compared with $6.3 million in the first quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter were 7 basis points of average loans, and below our typical
long-term level. Non-accrual loans were $35.1 million at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from $49
million at the end of the first quarter.
I was glad to see the great work of our energy team, rationalizing our concentration in our energy portfolio. Energy
loans represented 5.9% of loans at the end of the second quarter. And I'm happy to declare that we've reached
mid-single digits.
Finally, after more than two years of working with over 32,000 PPP borrowers, we've helped better than 98% of
them with forgiveness. Our team's worked on the last few hundred PPP borrowers who haven't yet begun the
process, and we're committed to helping every one of them get across the finish line. And I couldn't be more
proud of our team and the efforts that they've made in helping our customers and the business.
You may remember that I've described our efforts in this area as historic and heroic, and while I hope we don't
ever encounter another historic challenge like that any time soon, as I mentioned earlier, we've got strategies and
systems in place to allow us to succeed in all economic environments.
And I should point out that Frost employees do heroic deeds every day. I continue to hear from customers who
get help from our bankers in sorting out their final finances after a spouse passed away, or who got financial
planning that enabled their kids to go to college, or who simply just had a pleasant interaction with the bankers,
while they were having an otherwise lousy day. For us, those interactions are just doing our jobs in accordance
with Frost philosophy to our customers. Those are heroic acts. I'd like to thank our people for being a force for
good in people's everyday lives.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter
was 2.56%, up 23 basis points from the 2.33% reported last quarter. Higher yields on both loans and balances
held at the Fed had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage. The increase was also
positively impacted, to a lesser extent, by higher volumes of investment securities and loans and a lower relative
percentage of earning assets invested in balances at the Fed as compared to the prior quarter. These positive
impacts were partially offset by higher deposit costs.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $18.1 billion during the second quarter,
up $964 million from the first quarter average, as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the
quarter. We made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately $1.8 billion, which included about $1
billion in treasuries yielding about 3%, $400 million in agency MBS securities with a yield of about 4%, and about
$400 million in municipal securities with a taxable equivalent yield of about 4.7%.
Our current expectation is that we would invest an additional $3.2 billion of our excess liquidity into investment
purchases through the remainder of the year. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was
2.87% in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter. The taxable portfolio, which averaged
$10.3 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, had a yield of 2.04%, up 14 basis points from the first quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $7.8 billion during the second quarter, down about $363
million from the first quarter and had a taxable yield of 4.04%, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. At the end of
the second quarter, 76% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF-insured. The duration of the
investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was 5.6 years, up from 5.2 years at the end of the first
quarter, primarily related to the extended duration on lower coupon mortgage-backed securities.
Looking at loans, average loans for the quarter were $16.7 billion, up $288 million from the first quarter, or 1.8%.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the average growth in the prior quarter would have been $446 million or 2.8%.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was 4.04%, up 30 basis points from the previous quarter.
Looking at deposits on a linked-quarter basis, average deposits were up $1.8 billion or 4.1%. Public fund
balances, which can be seasonal, had a negative effect on the linked-quarter growth as those average balances
were down $400 million. The linked quarter growth has come primarily from growth in average interest-bearing
deposits, which were up $1.4 billion or 5.5%. The cost of interest-bearing deposits for the quarter was 22 basis
points, up 14 basis points from the first quarter.
Regarding total non-interest expenses, we continue to expect total non-interest expense for the full-year 2022 to
increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits over 2021 reported levels. Increasing our minimum wage to
$20 per hour in December of last year, combined with continued market salary pressures, our expansion efforts in
Dallas and Houston and expenses associated with the rollout of our announced residential mortgage product are
the primary drivers of the growth in non-interest expenses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8%. And our current expectation is our full year effective tax
rate should be in the range of about 13% to 14%, but that can be affected by discrete items during the year.
Regarding the estimates for full-year 2022 earnings, our current projections include a 50-basis-point Fed rate
increase in September, followed by a 25-basis-point increase in November. With those rate assumptions, we
currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of $7.85 for 2022 is low.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Wanted to start, so given such a low loan-to-deposit ratio and plenty of liquidity to fund loan growth, what was the
thought behind driving such strong growth in interest bearing deposits in the quarter, or were these primarily just
coming from new markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steven, it's – as much as anything, this is a cultural decision and it's one that's based on experience to – I mean,
we've – a big part of our value proposition really, I mean, it rests on three things, that everyone's significant for us
that would give a square deal. It'll give you an excellent set of fair price, and we're safe, sound place to do
business for employees and customers.
And as corny as it sounds, we're just giving our customers a square deal. As we've seen interest rates move up, it
just makes sense for us to recognize that if we're going to have a value proposition that customers can trust, like I
mentioned earlier in my comments. And we saw this happen back in 2017 when we saw the Fed rates raise a 100
basis points back then, we were focused on the too big to fail pricing because that's who we compete with more
than anybody else. They haven't moved at all.
And we just we just got behind. We started to see some movement in deposits at that time. And interestingly, that
was kind of when we sort of cracked the code on more consistent core loan growth. And it just wasn't the right
time, number one, for a balance sheet to show that nothing is – I just really felt like we were losing trust and the
industry was losing trust when they just sat there as and people read that interest rates are going up all the time.
So I'm not saying we couldn't have a lower rate and get away with it, if you will. But just that's not the way to do
business. And so, it's really just focusing on being fair with the customers. And we just feel like the value of those
deposits are continuing to increase and certainly the relationships are going to make your money on a long-term
basis.

Jerry, any thoughts there on prices?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. I think you've got it, Phil. I mean, that's exactly what we're doing. I think you're right, if – we don't have to
increase and I'll put that in air quotes, but I think we certainly believe that it's the right thing from a culture
standpoint to be increasing these deposits. And as Phil said, in 2017, we were a little slow in raising rates. We
kind of fell behind and certainly felt like by mid-July when the Fed had raised rates 100 basis points, that we were
behind and actually we're starting to see some of our deposits leaving the bank. And as we all know, it's a lot
more expensive to bring the new deposits on. So we just felt like this time will be a little bit more ratable as we
move along as rates increase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steven, the thing is to – I mean, look, you can read the newspaper and we can – believe, we know what's
happening because that's what everyone is saying, but we don't know where rates are going and we don't know
where inflation is headed or what the Fed's been doing. [indiscernible] (00:17:53) but if we just change our
business, do it the right way as we go along, we're not going to have to go into any big dislocations like we did in
2017 when we – that was pretty tough for our shareholders for us to have chuck all that down at one time. And we
just – it's all about just being disciplined as we move on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
It's interesting because many peers are allowing deposits to run off this quarter, right, and their loan to deposit
ratios are going up fairly materially. So here you're holding it pretty steady. So if we follow that strategy forward,
how should we think about deposit betas through this cycle versus where you were the last time rates moving
higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steven, I think what we said last quarter and I would say the same thing today, going back to the last cycle, say,
2016 through 2018, our betas were about a 30% on interest-bearing and, say, 20% on total. And that's sort of
what we're assuming right now for full-year 2022. We've got that same sort of beta. We don't have that today
given the increases were a little bit lighter than that. But then our projection is, that's what we built in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. Then final question, it's good to hear the new markets continue to trend well above goal,
particularly for loans and new households in Dallas. Was the goal too low? I'm curious why you're coming in so far
ahead of the goal. Thanks.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, when we started the program and we talked to our board about it and talked to each other about it, I
mean, our goal was based upon what we had achieved for the 40 locations that we had opened prior to starting
that strategy.
We went back 8 years, and we said, look, this is what we've done on average. And we said, if we can do that, that
strategy was successful, and we said, if we can do that that will be successful. It'll result in a great return for
shareholders. So we've set that up as sort of – and that's what we want to do.
And I kind of wanted to keep it the same as we moved into Dallas, because I think it kind of gives a context for the
performance in those markets. And so, could we use a different number? Yeah. We could. But we know what this
one means. We know where it came from. And we're going to go there. I will say, Steven, that honestly, I don't
think there's any reason why Dallas shouldn't be better than Houston in terms of its success, because, as you
know, two-thirds to 70% of this business and – of the business in the pro forma is commercial business. And
Dallas has as good a commercial market that is really well diversified and full of middle market and small
business, with a little bit less energy concentration as Houston. And as great as Houston is, I think the business
demographics around Dallas could be even better.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please proceed with
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to touch on expenses. I think I'm doing the
math right. If I annualize the first half of the year, looks like you're growing at about 10%. So would imply a
deceleration in the back half of the year. Understanding that a lot of expenses related to Dallas have been
occurred and obviously wage inflation, stuff like that. But is that kind of the right way to think about, is that the
expense growth should kind of slow as they move through the back half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that's right. I think a lot of the dollars that we put in are built into the base. But we moved our increases for
most of the organization to May. So really, even in the second quarter, you don't have the full effect of all of our
increases. So I think that for us, the fourth quarter is typically the highest and it's unusually high given we pay a lot
of our incentives in that quarter. And so, there's a lot of true of this going on, obviously, that the volumes that
we're seeing this year have been pretty strong. And so, I would envision that as we go through the year, we're
continuing to increase those incentives.

So I think that if I were you, I would stick with my full-year guidance and then just kind of take the next two
quarters. But really don't want to slice the cheese too thin and I'll just kind of stick to that full-year guidance that
says just look at 2021 and grow that on a low double digit growth. And I think you'll you're kind of be kind of what
we're projecting currently based on what we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I think at the outset you mentioned that the pipelines were down
about 2% sequentially. I mean, it looks like the period end ex-PPP growth slowed a little bit this quarter versus
last quarter. Any rationale for that? Is it a function of pay-downs? Is that customers being a little less active? A
combination of both? And I think you had previously talked about kind of a high-single-digit ex-PPP average
growth for the year. Is that still kind of in the realm of expectations? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I don't I don't want to read too much into the weighted pipeline number, that was fairly flat, down 2%,
because if you look at the C&I piece of that and this is on a non-annualized basis, it was up 4% on a linked-
quarter basis, right? So we multiply that times 4, 16%. So I don't know if you want to do that or not, but I mean, it's
this positive.
The consumer weighted pipeline is up a non-annualized 62%. And it was really the fact that it was commercial
real estate that was down and non-annualized 13%. So – and we closed so many commitments. We were – our
commitments were up 27% on a linked-quarter basis, non-annualized. I mean, that's putting a lot through the
pipeline. And so, if it goes down, somewhere it's a little weaker and really it's mainly in the commercial real estate,
I'd like to believe it's more because we're reloading on that.
And as I look at the opportunities that I talk about, I think I talked about them, they're up like 9%. That's un-
annualized on a linked-quarter basis, were up 10% on a year-over-year. That tells me that we're still on a growth
basis, seeing deals and we're seeing growth in that. So we're going to keep our eye on it. But the tone that I get,
Michael, from our officers is that it's still good and we're still seeing lots of opportunity.
You're seeing some I'd say, I want to be careful the words I use. You look at real estate, particularly some kinds of
real estate with the higher rates and uncertainty in some areas you can see still good deal flow, but some
beginning to slow some. And I'd say, obviously, office for sure, maybe a little bit of industrial on the investor side. I
think single-family housing is, it's not, it's not slowing really much, but it's – I think we expect it to, I think our
borrowers expect it to. But they're also saying that's probably good cause they can really not keep up with the
pace today.
But you're still seeing really good growth in multi-family for really good economic reasons. You're seeing really
good growth in retail. Just for example, you've seen some good growth in owner occupied. So the tone is still
good. But the other thing I'll say is things are changing. The fed try to slow things down. And, I think in Texas that
we are a we're a little different in terms of the activity we're seeing in terms of in-migration with individuals and
businesses. So I'd like to believe we can be a little bit more – a little bit better than the general economy. But,
anyway, I've rambled too much on that, but that's kind of what we're seeing.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Just first question may be around credit was obviously – credit is not an issue, but just wanted to get a sense
of how far down do you think the loan losses can go before you begin provisioning. And just give us a perspective
of where you think the steady state reserves ratio looks like if we start seeing some signs of a slowdown or even a
potential recession over the next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, what I'd say is that – and we had this last quarter, we have it again this quarter, there's been quite a bit of
color in the in the 10-Q. But your part of our assumption as we work in our CECL model is the probability of a
recession. And so, included in our overlays are is an assumption, a 30% assumption that there might be a
recession. And so, we stress our portfolio accordingly. And that's kind of what we're at a 1.44% reserve coverage
right now, which I think is pretty strong. And when you look at that, that discussion in the 10-Q, I think you'll see
kind of what we were alluding to. I mean, as Phil mentioned, there's a lot of nuances going on in the economy
right now, a lot of uncertainty. But really what's happening in our cases is giving some sort of probability to a
recession.
Where can it go? I guess it's CECL. We – when this was adopted, we were probably at 1%. I don't I don't foresee
that we bring our reserve coverage, all things being equal and credit quality being great, I don't see the reserve
ending at 1%. But I think for now, we certainly feel extremely comfortable with where we're at from a reserve level.

Should the economy, all of a sudden, we get through this and feel like things are continuing to improve, I could
see that reserve coverage continue to continue to decrease.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just a separate question, Jerry. I wanted to, one, confirm the $3.2 billion number of securities
was a net number as opposed to gross; and just talk to us, was the 10-year yield is now at [ph] 269 (00:29:28),
who knows whether – and how much further the Fed has to go. Talk to us on the other side of this. If we do get
into a period of Fed rate cuts next year, how are you thinking about protecting the margin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. What I'll say for now is that – and what we're looking at and it's something that we visit about all the time,
right? And right now we're staying pretty consistent. Our purchases, we've said, would be 70% treasuries and
15% municipals and MBS securities. And we've been pretty consistent with that. We've moved around a little bit.
We might accelerate things, but it's something that we're continually talking about.
And what we're doing is really buying in the three- to five-year. That's really what we're looking. It's where we saw
the most value and where we made the bulk of our purchases. We'll continue to have those conversations and
we'll look at risk and reward and see what makes sense. If we think that it makes sense to add duration, if we
think that rates might go down and we want to protect some of that, we could do that. Obviously, we still have
plenty of liquidity. I think this morning we were close to $13 billion still even after all the purchases that we've
made.
So we'll just – it's something that we continually visit with. And I think that we've been pretty transparent and we're
continuing to look at derivative products. We haven't done anything yet. We'll look and see if something makes
sense for us we've done it in the past, but at this point we haven't put our toe in the water and, we'll just continue
to do that. I will say that given the conversation earlier on deposit rates, our deposit rates are much higher than
most, right? And so, in an environment where you see rates going down, we've proven that we can bring rates
down as well, right? We've been through a long rate cycle. You followed our performance through a pretty low
long period of zero interest rates. So we've proven we can take our rates down and that given through the – our
value proposition to our customers, we really haven't lost deposits during that sort of time period. So we do have
that as well, which some of our peers would not have if they're not raising rates.

Hey, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So if you look at cash to average earning assets that finished the quarter at about 27%, you put another $3.2
billion of cash into bonds. It feels like by the end of the year it could be closer to 20-or-so percent. Longer term,
where would you like to run cash to assets? Does that get down to 5% or is that too low? Longer term, what level
of cash would you like to have on the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm looking at Phil and I'm kind of laughing because every time our balance is at the Fed decreased from $13
billion to $12.5 billion or something, he's calling me and asking me what's going on. In all seriousness, you
followed us for a while, we've tended to be more conservative on our levels of cash, but we've been all over the
board. And obviously we feel very comfortable and confident in alternative sources that we would have available
to us. I think that off the cuff, if you said 5% feels kind of low to us right now. But – so I would say something in
that 5% to 10% is what we think about it and just see where we go from there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, I know last quarter we talked about spread income ex-PPP potentially growing on a high-teens
basis. But I mean, after you look at the increase in margin and spread income that you guys enjoyed in the
second quarter, it feels like that's too low. It feels like [indiscernible] (00:33:33). And any refresh on how you're
thinking about Fed income year-over-year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I guess, I would – what I would say is, yeah, the environment today is different than where we were a
quarter ago. I think our assumption at that point, the rates that we have in there now, given the rate hikes that
we've seen in June and July, our assumptions are I think rates will end up the year higher, 125 basis points. So
yeah, certainly given what – given that sort of an environment, yeah, a mid-teens sort of growth in that – in net
interest income is, it would be would be too low.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. And then, just finally on deposit balances, you've seen a lot of deposits shrink this quarter for some of your
peers, but you all saw some nice growth. I know you increased deposit rates. But do you think that you'll see any
sort of deposit outflows over the next year or so, or are you guys really hoping to keep growing the core deposit
base?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
I hope we keep growing. I mean, that's really what we've been focused on. Yeah. I was just thinking about the
question that Jerry answered and got asked about, interest rates and protection against interest rates, I mean, I
think we've done a pretty decent job over time of coming up with ways to manage that. But we really don't want to
be defined by that. What we're more and more defining ourselves as is a company that is focused on growth. And
if we're accessing great markets and we are – we're making the investments to grow in those markets and we get
any kind of rates at all, I mean, Fed could cut rates, but maybe they cut into zero, maybe not.
But we think that our job is pretty clear. It's just continue to grow the business. That means growing deposits,
which is really where the value of any banking franchise is, growing asset classes, and we've got the opportunity
to do that. And with products we've got, we've got the new mortgage product that we're going to be bringing up at
the end of the year. Direction of rates are important, but as Jerry said, we've got some flexibility because we have
been diligent in moving rates along with movements up. And – but I just tend to think that the more important thing
for us to be focused on is can we continue to show this organic growth by accessing these markets and proving
that we can take share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I would definitely be in the 22%. I wouldn't – I guide you more to the 20s and the high-teens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Low-20s. Okay. Perfect. And then do you happen to have the spot rate for interest-bearing deposit cost at quarter
end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't have it on me right now. I think A.B. is on. So we'll have him reach out to you, Dave, with that number. I
don't have it on me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. That's totally fine. I appreciate that. And then just a clarifying point, the $3.2 billion in securities purchases
you have for the rest of the year, that's in gross purchases, right? So growth would be somewhere $2 billion, $2.5
billion if you haven't had the maturities for the back half, that'd be great. But yeah, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So we've probably got – yeah, we probably got another $700 million, $700 million that would that would...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...it would be falling back to us. So that numbers is gross. Yeah, you're somewhere in the $2.5 billion range net.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And then, I guess, for the positive trends, those were very solid this quarter, was very impressive. Was just
curious if you had a component of that growth that came from Houston and Dallas versus the rest of the
franchise. And I know you'd mentioned expecting high single digit deposit growth for 2022. Are you still thinking in
that range or do you think that maybe you could do a little bit better just given the better first half results?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm still there. I think, Phil – you heard Phil talk, I think we're optimistic that it can be better given continued new
growth. I think that as rates go up, there'll be more and more pressure, obviously on us, especially on some of
those larger deposit balances.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So, yeah, I mean, that's what we're projecting. If it can be higher than that, we'll definitely be happy. But I do think
it's riskier the higher rates go on, especially on those larger accounts. And Dave, what was your other question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
With regard to the expansion, I think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Oh, yeah. On the expansion, so one thing that I'll give you year-over-year, I'll say they contributed 1% towards the
growth in average deposits.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with
your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Just one follow-up question, Phil, I guess, outside of things that you are doing and then the strength
in the market, how are you seeing competitors behave, one, in terms of just the risk appetite, are you seeing
competitors loosen the underwriting box? And then you mentioned you obviously go head-to-head with the largest
banks in your markets. Have you seen the bigger banks pull back a little bit given some of the capital constraints
they're facing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Ebrahim, in talking with our people in preparation for the call, there may be some marginal improvement in
structured competition. Not much, but I did hear one of our teams mention how they had won a deal on our
16


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
traditional underwriting which they seem surprised to do. I mean, we do that all the time. But I mean, this
particular instance, it seemed like they were pleased to see that.
So I'd say it's beginning to be a little bit more structurally sound, but that's not pervasive. I probably hear as many
stories or more stories of where you're seeing competition continue to increase. Maybe beginning to see a little bit
more competition on the C&I side as opposed to just the commercial real estate side. But it's still competitive. But
things are slowing a bit, I think, in the real estate side. I remember some conversations we had with builders who,
in some of these really hot markets, were expecting to see a 10% price change or reduction really by the end of
the year in certain residential markets. And the point they made is that's fine. It may be a slowing that will help us
catch our breath. We've had, I think, times to bill go from 120 days to 210 days or something like that. And they've
also got such wide margins, historically high margins. They've got plenty of room to fade that. And so, I don't think
it would be unwelcome in some ways to see a little bit of moderation in that market. We've heard that as well.

Hey. Jerry, can you give us a little bit of help on the trust in investment management and deposit service charges,
what you're thinking there? They're a little better than I thought it would be. But just give us some thinking on what
you see there for an outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. I guess, for the quarter, I'll be honest, on the trust in investment management fees, I was pleasantly
surprised that we ended up what we did. And what we saw was that we had a good month and – excuse me, a
17


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
good quarter in oil and gas fees, they were up about a $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, so – compared to second
quarter last year. So they really were able to offset a decrease that we saw in investment fees which were down
$1 million and I think our – excuse me, yeah, about $1 million, state fees down another $1 million.
So I don't – I would expect that given all the volatility and what's going on in the markets that we'll see some
pressure on that investment line item. We have continued to grow our managed accounts in that business. I think
we're up 5% in numbers of accounts compared to the second quarter last year. So I know there's a lot of focus on
trying to grow the business, but we will- we are feeling some pressure given the volatility in the market.
On deposit service charges, it's interesting. We've made, in my opinion, some changes that have really been I
think made a lot of sense for us and for our customers on overdraft fees when we instituted overdraft grades, and
then here recently in June, what we did was previously to get that $300 overdraft, you had to have a direct deposit
of at least $500 a month. And after our retail team did some work, we felt like that was punitive to some of our
customers, given the fact that not every employer pays the direct deposit.
And so, we lifted that in June and we're saying that's probably going to cost us $2 million. So we haven't seen the
impact of that, this additional change that we made. And then, we've also eliminated our NSF fees, which were
about $1.5 million if I remember correctly. So we'll see where that line item is going to see some pressure going
forward. But really, a lot of our growth as Phil has talked about the number of new accounts that we've been able
to bring on, where we expected some of those – some pressure on that line item, it's really been offset by
increases of numbers of transactions just given the increases in the number of customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. That kind of segues to my next question. Just the 7,200 in the new households all-time high. Is that how
are you doing in your legacy markets on that. And how – how much of that is driven by the new markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jon, one thing I'd guess I'd offer up to you is, if you look at just account openings from traditional branches which
you can include everything, which is mostly legacy, right? Account growth year-over-year from traditional
branches was 9.2%. So I'd say we're doing pretty good.
And I think it all revolves around a lot of things that are working for us. I think our value proposition is solid. We
give people square deal and great service. I mean, you don't always have to be looking over your shoulder, oh,
gee, I wonder what my banks paying anything, or are they paying anything on the deposit to me. We put in a lot of
work every week. Jerry's looking at the market where you go – we're talking to our lines of business. We're trying
to figure out what's fair. It's just a lot of things working for us. And our branch experience is, I think is unparalleled
in terms of what we do, not just the way people are treated and dealt with, but just the physical facilities are
beautiful and they just create a great experience.
So the other thing I talked about this last time, really think it was interesting what happened with this location that
we opened up in the west part of San Antonio that's a legacy market. There was one we've been in 154 years.
And the growth we've seen in that particular location was literally multiples of what we did in our best Houston
location in the first six months, let's say, of its life. It's already at 24 – yeah, it's already $24 million in deposits in,
six, seven months. I mean, so and that's just the legacy market where you open the location. So there's
something going on that I hope we can continue to leverage. And then, I feel good. I feel good. I feel good about
the way the whole business is operating and how we're moving forward just running a business.

the quarter. But you used the terms unusual and evolving in your...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...opening comments. And I've asked this on other calls, but there seems to be a disconnect between credit
quality that we're seeing from the banks and then what we see them to – see and read about every day. And
what's your take on where we're evolving to? Are you worried about it? Is Texas different? It sounds like you're
not seeing erosion in your loan book, but just any big picture thoughts on whether the market's right or you're right
or where are we going?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it's a great question, Jon, and I'll tell you a disconnect that we are sort of seeing is, yeah, when we talk to
customers, on Main Street, I mean, there's not a lot of talk about slowing. You know, there's not a lot of talk about
recession. There's talk about where am I going to get the next person to hire? What on earth am I going to have
to pay them? And what's the next bubble in the supply chain? And how can I get the capacity to the warehouse,
what I can get so that I'm ready to move forward when I can get the other parts of the supply chain that I need. I
mean, I think Main Street is those are the things that they are dealing with and how they feel about their business
is different than when they go home at night and sit on the couch and watch the news and hear discussions about
the economy, at least in the markets that we're operating in.
Now, there are some that as admittedly are slowing. If you're dependent on developing a deal that's two years
away from being finished and you don't know what rates are going to be or what the economy is going to be.
There's some slow there. There's some slowing more circumspection there. But the economy is strong here and
you know, I'm not too worried about its direction right now, but it is unusual and evolving because the Fed's
increasing rate 75 basis points at a time and we'll see what impact that has over time.
