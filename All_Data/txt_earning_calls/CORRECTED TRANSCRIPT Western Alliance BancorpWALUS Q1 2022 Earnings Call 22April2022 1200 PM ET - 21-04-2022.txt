Good morning, everyone. Besides Dale sitting alongside of me, Tim Bruckner, our Chief Credit Officer is also here
today as well. So we had solid performance this quarter as the company passed the $60 billion asset milestone
and we're excited by the business opportunities before us. For the first quarter, WAL generated total net revenues
of $555 million, net income of $240 million, and EPS of $2.22. We remain one of the most profitable banks in the
industry with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.64% and 23.9%,
respectively, which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels in the quarters to come.
Balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly loan growth of $2 billion or 21.2% annualized, and deposits
rose by $4.5 billion, or 38.7% annualized, as we continue to effectively attract and deploy liquidity. Excluding PPP
runoff, loans grew $2.2 billion in the first quarter with residential loans increasing $2 billion. Healthy commercial
loan demand continued, but this quarter witnessed seasonal runoff of our warehouse lending loans by $640
million caused by mortgage supply constraints associated with lower inventories industry-wide.
Western Alliance diverse loan drivers continue to propel growth in the regional banking division, up $533 million;
tech and innovation, up $131 million; and hotel franchise finance, up $158 million. The flexibility of our national
commercial bank franchise provides material opportunities to grow both sides of the balance sheet and in the
event of an economic slowdown, allows for alternative growth avenues by product and geographic mix, unlike
many of our competitors.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Asset quality continues to remain stable, as total non-performing assets modestly increased $19 million to 17
basis points of total assets, and net charge-offs were only $200,000. As the economic environment continues to
evolve, we believe that our deliberate strategy to responsibly grow the national business lines, where we possess
specialized sector and underwriting expertise and in low to no loss loan categories, which now comprise 53% of
total loans, will allow us to maintain a superior credit risk profile to the overall commercial banking sector.
Regarding AmeriHome, mortgage banking revenue increased $2.5 million quarterly to $78 million as gain on sale
margin compression and lower production volumes were offset by a rise in loan servicing revenue. As discussed
at the time of acquisition, the natural macro hedge between servicing income, rising MSR valuations and declining
gain on sale margins was on display this quarter. Additionally, AMH continues to unlock value as an emerging
commercial bank, leveraging our ability to efficiently deploy liquidity into low credit risk held-for-investment assets
with attractive yields.
AmeriHome continues to demonstrate the unique opportunities to unlock value as a bank-owned mortgage
business such as $4.9 billion in low cost custodial deposits, $2.5 billion in EBO loan purchases, $370 million in
warehouse referral loans already generated to date and residential loans purchased through their correspondent
loan business. These opportunities drive additional value for AmeriHome that cannot be matched by other
standalone mortgage companies.
Dale will now take you through the financial performance.

Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $240 million, EPS of $2.22 and pre-provision net
revenue of $307 million. Total net revenue of $555 million has increased 65% year-over-year, but declined $5
million during the quarter, primarily due to certain non-interest income items. Net interest income modestly
declined $1 million during the quarter to $449 million as strong held for investment loan growth of $2 billion was
impacted by two fewer business days in the quarter and interest expense on our credit linked notes issued in late
December.
Overall, non-interest income increased (sic) [decreased] (00:05:51) $4 million to $106 million from the prior
quarter, driven primarily by $6.6 million mark-to-market losses on equity securities and a smaller benefit from
credit guarantees of $4.9 million from the prior quarter, which was partially offset by a gain on sale of municipal
investment securities.
As Ken noted, mortgage banking-related income increased $2.5 million quarterly as lower production volume and
a decline in net gain on loans originated and sold was offset by a rise in loan servicing revenue as rising interest
rates and falling prepayment speeds benefit MSR valuations net of hedges and servicing income. Gain on sales
revenue fell by half to $37 million while servicing revenue jumped to $41 million. Mortgage prepayment speeds fell
as new mortgage rates rose at the fastest rate in [ph] 40 years (00:06:39), making refinancing uneconomic and
thereby extending the lines of our servicing assets. This is the natural hedge of the mortgage business and why
we manage the business for total mortgage revenue.
If we had rapidly increased the value of our servicing rights we manufactured in the quarter, we would have
booked a higher gain on sale and lower servicing income in lockstep. Finally, non-interest expense increased
$10.8 million in the quarter, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 44.1%. Q1 expenses have historically run modestly
higher and we expect this is the high watermark for this ratio and declining in 2022.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Turning to our net interest drivers, investment yields increased 26 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.77% as
rates rose and as prepayments fell on residential mortgage-backed securities, reducing purchase price premium
amortization. Near quarter-end through the securities sales and reinvesting, we moved over $1 billion in securities
to 100% re-pricing beta without a give up in yield that will increase sensitivity in the current quarter.
On a linked-quarter basis, loan yields declined 5 basis points driven by a greater proportion of residential loans
and lower prepayment and PPP fees. Yields on loans held for sale benefited from rising mortgage rates and
increased 10 basis points to 3.14%. The end of quarter spot rate for HFS loans was 3.73%. Total cost of funds
increased by 2 basis points from the prior quarter to 27%, primarily due to the credit linked notes transactions
entered into in December, demonstrating the strength of our deposit franchise to raise low cost, the key sources
of funding, interest-bearing deposit costs remained fairly flat at 21 basis points, while the balances grew $2.3
billion during the quarter.
Net interest income of $450 million was 42% higher year-over-year but declined slightly from the prior quarter.
Overall, average earning assets increased $1.2 billion or 8.5% annualized. Net interest margin was relatively
stable at 3.32%, down 1 basis point from the prior quarter as our strong deposit growth led to a greater proportion
of earnings assets being held in cash and lower loan yields due to residential loan growth. This excess cash
provides us with optionality to deploy into higher yielding loans in future periods.
After the recent 25 basis point move by the Fed, our asset sensitivity has increased from last quarter, driven by
increased liquidity, as deposit growth exceeded loan growth by $2.5 billion and variable rate loans moved above
their floors. In a rate shock scenario of plus 100 basis points over – for the next 12 months and on a static
balance sheet, net interest income is expected to rise 6.8%. Using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet,
we expect net interest income to grow over 25% over the base rate. And to a 200 basis point rate shock scenario
on a static balance sheet, net interest income is expected to rise 15.4% and a multiple of this impact when
balance sheet growth expectations are also incorporated.
Given our first quarter net interest income run rate of $450 million or $1.8 billion per year, we should see at least a
40% increase in net interest income in the shock plus 200 bps scenario or $720 million annually, which the market
projects will see on an accelerated rate increase trajectory later this year. An important driver of this projected
increase in net interest income is due to moving off of our rate floors. The rate floor schedule shows that 84% of
our loans will be off their floor with a 100 basis point increase in rates, which should happen by the second FOMC
meeting to be held in mid-June. And they become completely irrelevant in the third quarter. I would note that
these floors served us well to sustaining net-interest income for two years during the pandemic.
Our efficiency ratio increased to 44% from 41.8% in Q4 as certain seasonal expenses outpaced net revenue
growth. Non-interest expense rose $11 million from the last quarter due to lower loan origination cost deferrals
and higher seasonal expenses in Q1. Again, at 44%, we believe the efficiency ratio will decrease through
successive quarters this year.
Pre-provision net revenue was $307 million for the quarter, a 52% increase from the same period last year. This
resulted in a PPNR ROA of 2.1%, a decline of 13 basis points compared to last quarter, primarily driven by
balance sheet growth outpacing PPNR. This continued strong performance and leading capital generation
provides us with significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, manage capital actions and meet
credit demand.
Balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased $2 billion or 5.2%
to $41 billion, and deposit growth of $4.5 billion brought balances to $52 billion at quarter end. Mortgage servicing

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
rates balances grew $250 million in the quarter to $950 million as no MSR sales were completed during Q1. As
we expect, this asset will continue to benefit from a rising rate environment.
Goodwill and intangibles increased $63 million, primarily due to our acquisition of Digital Disbursements in
January. Tangible book value per share decreased $0.71 or 1.9% over the prior quarter to $37.13 primarily due to
fair value losses on available for sale securities recorded in all other comprehensive income. Tangible book value
increased 12.4% over the prior year.
We continue to generate consistent organic loan growth from our national commercial business strategy, and are
seeing balanced demand between regional banking divisions and national business lines. Loans held for
investment grew $2 billion in the quarter with continued strong growth in residential real estate. However, drivers
of loan growth this quarter in particular, net C&I growth was negatively impacted by $228 million in PPP loan
payoffs and a $640 million decline in mortgage warehouse balances where lower housing inventory or higher
rates held back the typical seasonal upturn in purchased home volume. Given current pipeline strength, especially
a note finance and MSR lending businesses where the team is onboarding new AmeriHome clients, we still
expect mortgage warehouse balances in aggregate to be flat year-over-year for 2022. Mortgage warehouse has
already rebounded $270 million quarter to date.
C&I growth benefited from healthy contributions of our regional banking divisions of $209 million and other
national business lines of $223 million, especially in tech and innovation, restaurant franchise demands. CRE
investor and construction and land also contributed $320 million and $250 million of net loan growth respectively.
Our national commercial franchise provides optionality to deploy liquidity by business mix and geography.
Turning to deposits, we continue to see broad base core deposit growth across our diversified channels that will
generate stable, low cost funding in different rate environments. Deposits grew $4.5 billion or 38.7% annualized in
the first quarter, driven by increases in non-interest bearing DDA of $2.2 billion, interest-bearing DDA of $1.3
billion and savings and money market of $1.3 billion. These were partially offset by a decrease in the most
expensive category CDs, $238 million. Non-interest bearing DDAs comprised 45% of our total deposit mix.
Our specialty deposit franchise continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to support
loan growth with deposits from HOA up by $632 million, settlement services increased $308 million, and tech and
innovation up by $158 million. Settlement services have successfully incorporated digital disbursements into the
franchise and has already begun benefiting from synergies through expanded relationships and new affiliations
with claims administrators and law firms.
Our asset quality continues to remain stable and total classified assets and special mention loans as a
percentage of total loans are lower than they were in 2019. As the economic environment continues to evolve, we
believe, our deliberate strategy to responsibly grow national business lines where we possess specialized sector
and underwriting expertise in a low to no loss categories which now compose 53% of total loans will allow us to
maintain superior credit risk profile to the overall commercial banking sector.
Special mention loans remain relatively stable on a proportion of total funded loans at 85 basis points. Total
classified assets rose $64 million in Q1 to $365 million or 60 basis points to total assets due to the temporary
impact of the Omicron variant. Quarterly net losses were negligible for the first quarter. Our total loan ACL
increased $11 million from the prior quarter to $301 million as the provision exceeded losses. In all, total loan ACL
for funded loans declined 1 basis point to 0.73% at quarter end. Adjusting for the $5.4 billion loans that are
covered by credit linked notes were ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party, the ACL coverage ratio
rises to 84 basis points.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Given our industry leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic
growth and maintain well-capitalized regulatory ratios. Our tangible common equity to total assets of 6.7% was
bolstered by net income and 1.3 million shares issued at $408 million in proceeds under the ATM, but also
affected this quarter by negative fair value marks on available for sale debt securities. Our CET1 ratio was
essentially flat at 9%.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, our tangible book value per share declined $0.71 to
$37, primarily reflecting the adverse AFS market quarter end. While rates have continued to rise in April, the rate
of increase we witnessed in the term structure in the first quarter of the yield curve should subside later this year.
Given our robust capital generation, we still expect that 2022 will again be a year of tangible book value growth.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken to conclude with closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I was very pleased with Q1 results and the management team's ability to adapt to the changing interest rate in
economic environments. Loan growth was strong. Deposits grew more than double that amount. Credit remains
solid and clean, expenses are balanced for both near-term efficiency and long-term investments, and net interest
income sensitivity increased as variable rate loans are projected to rise above their floors.
AmeriHome's first quarter results remain consistent with our overall pro forma guidance that we gave at the time
of acquisition, which was $2.02 and we are tracking above this. The composition of that performance is more
skewed towards net interest income, which is consistent with our expectations, but more pronounced with rising
rates. Deposit growth and loan growth from AmeriHome have both exceeded our expectations and taking on
greater significance in this rapidly rising rate environment. Going forward, we expect mortgage banking revenues
to be in line with Q1 levels, and any disruption to this may be made up with balance sheet growth.
For the remainder of the year, we continue to support our full-year $9.80 EPS for loan and deposit growth
expectations remain at $2 billion per quarter, with a bias to the upside. Our loan and deposit pipeline bolstered by
client confidence gives us reassurance that our balance sheet will continue to grow in a safe, sound and
thoughtful manner.
We have modeled six rate hikes in 2022, starting with 50 basis points in May and then 25 basis points in June,
July, September and December. Admittedly, this is conservative. Net interest margin is expected to grow
throughout the year, lifting net interest income sequentially as loan growth provides incremental revenue support.
Net interest income sensitivity has climbed substantially from the prior quarter. It is our expectation based upon
the projected forward yield curve that nearly all of our variable rate loans with floors will be in the money next
quarter further giving support to PPNR progressively increasing throughout the year as our efficiency ratio
declines.
The bank asset quality remains solid. We've not seen emerging delinquencies or defaults within any segment.
Our base economic model is for a slowdown, but not a recession. And then lastly, capital, we believe our internal
capital generation can support up to $4 billion of loan growth without returning to the equity markets.
At this time, Dale, Tim and I would be happy to take your questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, maybe Ken, Dale, just going back to your earnings outlook for $9.80 unchanged from last quarter, just
talk to us around how the trajectory of NII, as you mentioned, right, I think the market's pricing in maybe a 50
basis points hike in May, June. So, you should have meaningfully more rate sensitivity on the asset side coming
up for the back half of the year. Just wondering, Dale, if the forward curve plays out as expected, what does that
mean in terms of year-over-year NII growth? And what's the offset in terms of why your EPS outlook didn't change
and move higher? Is it just because you're assuming lower mortgage earnings? So, I would appreciate if you can
address both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I think as Ken mentioned he gave the rate scenario that basically reconciles to the $9.80. What we
show on slide 7 is a more accelerated rate path, which is perhaps more in line with what expectations are from
the FOMC actions. So, between both of those, we can get to $9.80 based upon a more gentle rate path forward
than maybe what we'll see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I'm pretty optimistic about what you're going to see in the next three quarters in terms of net interest income
growth. And I think it's going to be some of the largest quarter-over-quarter increases that this company has
posted organically in its history. And so, yeah, you could say that the $9.80 – again, I keep telling you, the $9.80
is the floor is what we said last quarter and we feel very comfortable with the $9.80 and we'll go from there and
we're going to update – we'll update in the middle of the year our EPS guidance.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Got it. And a follow-up, Dale, just talk to us around one, my sense is you expect deposit growth, so the level of
deposit growth and what you're assuming in terms of deposit betas as we go through the rate hikes and just mix
shift moving from NIB to interest-bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, our deposit betas ran in the 40s on money market accounts last time. We think we're going to be in that
same area this time around. Interest-bearing checking is about 10 points lower than that. Again, we think that
that's probably going to be somewhat similar. I can make arguments for why it could be more accelerated. But
then with liquidity away, it could actually be a little bit lower than that.
Regarding earnings – ECRs, those were in the 20% range last time. We think those are likely to be accelerated in
terms of what we're looking at. But even from there, even going into the 30s, we think that, again, you can see
that with a lot of our loan book, 57% variable, that that is going to have a yawning yield relative to a more muted
expansion of cost structure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Let me just add a couple of points there to Dale. One, we kind of feel our geographic and product and national
business segments provide growth through diversified channels. And that's, again, what gives us a great deal of
comfort to say deposit growth $2 billion floor. And as you can see, what we just did this quarter, we feel very
comfortable with the $2 billion. We also feel very comfortable that AmeriHome continues to attract and bring in
deposit growth, which we always expected, and you're seeing that as well.
As it relates to maybe deposit pricing pressure near term, that's been relatively muted for us. And only a handful
of clients have been looking to recalibrate their pricing. And I think Dale might have said this on the last call, but
we're going to hold back repricing deposits until many of our clients have gone past their floors. And we're trying
to link those two together. So, just a little more color on the deposits for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dale, had a question on the efficiency ratio. You're talking about it being
the high watermark here in this quarter with gain on sale flat. What does that mean? I mean because the MSR
reval, if we strip that out, that would obviously launch it higher, so in the high 40s. So, what are the steps to get
that efficiency ratio back to that low 40% besides a stable gain on sale? If you can just give some color there,
that'd be helpful.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Well, so we – I mean, it's going to be much more muted growth relative to the revenue line. So, as we indicated,
we have a lot of kind of first quarter charges. This has always been the case, kind of stepping out, in terms of
incentives, rewards, just general compensation, all those reviews are effective in February. FAS 91 costs were
also – deferrals were lower in Q1. We don't have much of a deferral when loan growth comes from residential. We
expect a broadening out in terms of loan growth activity in Q2 and beyond, and that will result in more deferrals of
those costs kind of going forward.
So, I mean, seasonally, I think you can see this as well. It's a little murky for 2021 because in the second quarter
is when we acquired AmeriHome and AmeriHome had an efficiency ratio in the – at 50. So, pulling that in pulled
us up a little bit. I think it's notable that we brought them in and our efficiency ratio on a combined basis is where it
was before we acquired AmeriHome on a standalone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Casey, the simple calculus is that we expect net interest income growth, total revenue growth to grow at a much
faster multiple than expense growth. And so, while we manage our efficiency towards the low 40% range, we are
also mindful of all the investments that we need to make in this company and we are doing that in order to
become a $100 billion company unimpeded. So, we continue to invest in risk management and technology. We
have people, new hires, the education and the training of the recently hired. We continued to build out and
improve settlement services and business escrow services. And these two businesses present great opportunities
for us to increase franchise value, and it also carries with it a low cost funding.
So, we've got that going on plus several new initiatives in the loan and deposit areas which we hope will help us
towards 2023. And then we've also looked selectively at regional expansion and new business development hires.
So, that's all embedded into that efficiency ratio. And the fact that the revenues are growing at a, I'll say,
geometric pace versus the expenses that are growing more asymmetrically allows us to lower the expense
efficiency ratio for the year while simultaneously making all the investments we need for the out years. So, we're
in a good position doing that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And just following-up on the loan growth, the broadening out in the more traditional C&I. You
guys have talked about a 30% cap on resi. If the commercial side comes in a little lighter, is that 30% cap on resi
still a hard cap or could you potentially take that higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, let me describe it. I mean I think we saw that as more of a benchmark guidepost or whatever, someplace to
kind of reflect. And what that reflection is going to consider is where do we see our capital position, where do we
see our interest rate risk profile, what opportunities are going to be in front of us in terms of other credit
opportunities. So, I could see us going through 30% so long as all those other criteria are met. And I think that's
the case this time. I think it's notable.
So, in the first quarter, yeah, we did put on $2 billion of residential and those are basically 30 year fixed rate
mortgages. But that was matched by a little over $2 billion of non-interest bearing DDA. On top of that, we had
another $2.5 billion of deposit growth in – deposit types with betas in the 30s and 40s that is now either sitting in

100% increased betas on what we did in our securities book or in cash, again poised to take advantage of a
higher rate environment, which we think is imminent.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. Just last one for me, the Cash It launch, I think you guys talked about that last quarter being
starting up this in early 2Q. Just wondering if some updated thoughts there and if you could – any visibility on
what kind of deposit balances that might generate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, it's in beta testing. We've brought in a few clients and we're working on it. And what we do with all our
national business lines is we put it through beta testing and we're slow to roll out. But once we feel comfortable,
we then put our foot down on the accelerator. And so we're not there yet. And so, any of our deposit growth
projections do not have anything coming from this initiative. And as we get more comfortable, the initiative will
provide more details as we go forward throughout the year.

Let's see. Did I miss it? What was the MSR fair value market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we had MSR or servicing revenue was $41 million in the first quarter. It's been lower in the fourth
quarter and other periods. And I think if you look at our balance of $950 million and what would be an expected
return just on servicing alone, that would have been about $16 million. So we're saying $16 million was kind of
normalized. What we didn't do is we were maybe a little slower to increase the value of the servicing rights we
were creating as we bought, aggregated and presented loans to the GSEs. We did this because we thought it
was actually going to be increasing in value in the fourth quarter, and we didn't see that.
And I think we've talked about this before, Brock, but initially what happened was even though rates were rising
and you would typically see an extension of CPR lives, it was a little bit like I'll call it last call where everyone said,

So, if we had done that earlier, what we would have had in the first quarter earnings, instead of showing $41
million of servicing revenue and $37 million of gain on sale, that number, the gain on sale number would have
been higher and the servicing revenue would have been down. And I put that – our core earning rate was $25
million – $16 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Let's unpack there. So, if I look at – so, one question is, do you intend to build above the $950 million level
in MSR or are you a seller going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I might note that we actually contracted to sell $209 million of servicing rights in the second week of April. And
that would hold this basically flattish to the $950 million level. We do think that within certainly these lower
coupons that, they're not going to get any better than they are. And so liquidating them can make sense. So, I
don't expect our MSR number to change considerably from where we were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Just to add that the sale of the MSRs that we just did also came in at a higher valuation than what we
marked the MSR at the end of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Yeah. I guess we're all struggling with what that line. What mortgage revs could look like, assuming, for
example, a positive mark in Q2 just because of where rates have risen and, maybe a stable servicing number.
Could you speak to that? I know you give guidance that you expect mortgage revs to be relatively flat, but just
kind of boil that down a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Let me speak to it a little bit and also take you back to our thought process at the acquisition. So again, we
think the total mortgage servicing revenues, that's how we look at it or banking revenues, I should say, are going
to remain relatively flat, which is at or near Q1 levels as we go forward during the course of the year. If those
revenues should fall somewhat short, we believe we'll be able to make that up in net interest income in the
deposit growth we are seeing and the MSR loan growth we expect during the course of the year coming from
AmeriHome.
And the reason why I want to bring this up and bring you back to the acquisition is I think it's real important to
remember why we did the AmeriHome acquisition. We didn't see it as a mortgage company that we bought for
three multiple on a forward basis. We wouldn't have bought AmeriHome for a three forward multiple. That did not
interest us. But when we sat with their management team and we saw the number of revenue streams that could
be created inside of the bank that could get a much higher multiple, we really concluded that we're buying a
emerging bank at a three multiple, and that got us very excited.

And as you can see now, as mortgage revenues in the industry are falling short on the production side because of
volume and of course of compression on the margin side, we're one of the few mortgage companies that can
actually are segments that can actually generate offsetting revenues coming from deposits and coming from loan
growth. And also being able to generate loans to go into our book, held for investment to soak up this extra
liquidity we have. So, just wanted to bring you back to why we did the deal and what – we have a number of
levers here, and therefore, we don't get hung up solely on the mortgage banking income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Brock, I mean, I looked at where we're going to see in terms of the rapid expansion of net interest income based
upon the rate environment and the liquidity that Ken mentioned. And I do think that with a stable revenue from
mortgage, direct mortgage operations, gain on sale and servicing revenue combined, that number is going to
continue to be dwarfed by what we're going to see on net interest income for the combined bank, including what
we get from the enhanced deposit growth that we've had from AmeriHome buyers.

Dale, I wanted to follow-up on the ECR deposits. I think at last quarter they were around $11 billion. Did that
number remain relatively stable? And will the cost of those deposits continue to manifest themselves in non-
interest expense as opposed to interest expense? Just curious if that's kind of where you're going to keep those
going forward. And I assume that's not part of your kind of new interest rate sensitivity guidance in those tables or
is that included in there as well?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Yes, to all three questions. So, it is about the same number. Approximately half of our DDA is subject to these you
know cash ECRs. That number we think is going to be essentially kind of fairly stable going forward. And know
that the cost of that is not shown in our net interest income pickup as you indicated, it doesn't show up but it will
continue to show up in deposit costs in non-interest expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And so you said those deposit betas are typically run in the 30s?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Last time they ran in the 20s, but we're projecting they're going to be in the 30s this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just as my follow-up. It feels like the loans held-for-sale at least on average held in better
maybe than you initially thought. It sounds also like the spot rate is up fairly significantly. Can you kind of speak to
that line item and kind of what you guys kind of foresee coming there as you kind of think about managing
liquidity, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think that balance is going to be fairly flat kind of going forward. As you indicated, it is very sensitive, those
things role every three or four weeks, that rate was 3.73% at the end of Q1 and up from what the average was
just in anticipation of rates rising, you saw LIBOR and other rates climbing along the way. So, yeah, but that –
what we see right now is we saw our cash increase a little bit. We do think we're going to get a broader base and
more significant loan quarter this quarter. And we'll see, I believe, effective deployment of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And just one more on the cash. You kind of said previously you might wait to deploy some of that into the
bond portfolio if in fact deposits do run ahead of loans until rates maybe stabilize or move higher. Is that still your
thinking or just kind of curious, have you changed your mind on the cash management?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I mean you did say that our bond portfolio climbs in the first quarter, that was mostly toward the end of
the quarter.

It's actually grown further this quarter already, but those purchases have all been in, basically AA securities, 100%
re-pricing beta off of SOFR. And so, we think that as you're going to see the duration of the securities book fall
down a little bit here as well in Q2.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The gain on sale that we took last quarter was well timed and we've taken an extra – we've took the gain and then
we took the liquidity and reinvested it for higher returns. So, we like that trade that we did.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. I just wanted to get a little more clarification on activity analysis for NII. I'm just curious, what the
growth balance sheet assumption for that was, is it kind of assuming the $2 billion in loans and deposit growth.
Just wanted to clarify that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, our internal growth assumptions are stronger than the floor that we've indicated. We're saying basically, kind
of, at least $2 billion on loans and deposits each. And we think we've got kind of the pipelines and the products
array to be able to do that. I don't have a number to tell you, but they are greater than that. I think it's notable that
Ken mentioned that we expect to be able to do this without having to touch the capital markets growing up to $4
billion per quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then all that being said with the current interest rate environment and the forward curves, is it possible

It's not something we want. If we have the efficiency ratio dropping and dropping, we'll look to – and efficiency
ratio to me is just the exhaust fumes from the business and how we allocate our capital and liquidity. And quite
frankly, we probably allocate – I put more money into the expense line for other investment projects that we have
on the board, but have yet to begun to fund. And so, I think instead of getting it below 40%, we would take a
longer time horizon, which has served us very well in this company, and look to continue to work on the growth
projections for 2023 and 2024. That's how we would use the money.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, could you give us update on the non-QM transition with AmeriHome and if
you could quantify potentially any benefits for that this year and maybe next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, AmeriHome continues to generate non-QM and Jumbo loans for us. Probably today's rates are in the 4.75%
area, maybe a little more – a little higher than that. Probably the last time we talked, I think we're saying they were
doing about $200 million a month, they're probably up to now a little over $300 million a month, and we expect
that to continue to climb throughout the year.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Sorry to beat a dead horse on the mortgage question, but as we look out to the second
quarter and assuming the first quarter MSR valuation adjustment was kind of maybe overstated, maybe it was a
bit of a catch up, as Dale you may have alluded to from fourth quarter and rates not moving up quite as much. So,
if the valuation adjustment is lower this quarter, could you just help me understand or maybe position what the
offset would be on the mortgage banking line to kind of keep that number flat sequentially? Is it kind of volume-
driven or what are the other moving parts that are going to hold them flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I appreciate that. No, it'd be rate driven on gain on sale. So, what happened is – so we have independent
third parties, two of them that we go to and they value our mortgage book, our servicing rights book. And they
were both indicated that we were low on our valuation. And we also get broker quotes in there. And so we raised
that valuation and that resulted in, late in the quarter, a larger servicing revenue than would have otherwise been
the case.
16

(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Now, going into the second quarter, we take these now higher basis points of value from MSRs and we put them
into basically the MSR manufacturing model. And so now when we do a deal and then we sell it to Fannie or
Freddie, we're recognizing a larger gain on sale at the time and posting a larger mortgage servicing right. And so,
now if we sell those MSRs going forward, we're going to recognize a smaller gain.
So that number is going to be lower and in lockstep, gain on sale revenue will be higher.
As Ken indicated, we did the sale already, haven't closed it, it closes the next month for about 20%, 22% of our
mortgage servicing rights book at valuations above what we had marked them to. So we've taken that again and
said, you know what, they're still low on valuation. Now, that is into the machine that produces the value for MSR
valuations and gain on sale and so that is still higher again. So you're going to see that gain on sale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, not to beat a dead horse from this side, if there's any disruption to our forecast about mortgage banking
revenues, it'll be offset by the growth in net interest income that AmeriHome brings. Certainly the deposits and the
loans they bring in this environment, a higher rate environment will mute or offset any of the disruptions in the
mortgage revenue lines if it occurs at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Right. And I think we get that from a holistic perspective, but obviously more difficult on our side to kind of pull out
those parts. If I can just ask one more question on the loans held for sale. I thought I had recalled from last
quarter that the, kind of, where the last quarter's average was about where you wanted it. So, in terms of – and
you're saying now that where the quarter was this quarter is about right. So, I'm just curious if that was a change
in your thought process, because I assume you could have extended the dwell times a little bit to keep that
average higher if you wanted to, but just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we had this, we thought, a pretty cool little trick, whereby we could hold these loans longer and
basically earn the coupon rate on the loan for what is effectively only a four-week investment. So instead of
getting at the time 15 basis points, held the cash with the Federal Reserve, we're getting something north of 3%. I
would just say that maybe somebody caught on to us and the pricing dynamics for that trade have changed. And
so, we're using it less.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So, where the balances are now is kind of the sweet spot...

Just a couple of questions here. This is a crazy question. Can you talk a little bit about regional banking and
what's going on there in terms of loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
A little bit harder for us to do that. And the reason why is, a lot of our competition for new clients, we go up against
the large regionals and the money center banks and we like doing that. And more times than not, we can win that
with a higher price and greater service. But a lot of small regionals, we don't see, they're not really competing
against us as much or we're not competing against them. Average loan sizes for us have risen and as we moved
upscale to be with stronger or more liquid clients, we've just kind of left some of the regional banking in the dust.
The only place we really see them is a little bit in our metro C&I book, we'll run into them, but that's not a huge
growing book of business for us.

Okay. Dale, a question for you, this is kind of the opposite of the question I asked last quarter, but would you guys
talk about the $9.80 EPS – $9.80 plus EPS guide. Last quarter, I asked you about what it means for the first
quarter, but if you reverse that, it suggests an exit rate, that's $2.75 or higher for the year. I guess the question is,
are you blushing that kind of an exit rate for the year, which makes us more comfortable for 2023?
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's – like you said, I think that your area is where you're going to end up to do that. And with
the rate sensitivity, the rate rises that were – are I think right in front of us, we get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

hostile rate environment for mortgage, you're saying that the accretion numbers, the earnings numbers that you

Good Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at the cost structure for AmeriHome, is it based on kind of total added revenues to the bank or is there a
component of variable comp to the gain on sale, revenues and [indiscernible] (00:52:48)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
You faded out there a little bit, but I think I got the gist. Are we adding a cost structure to AmeriHome for
producing the banking related, traditional banking related net interest income? The answer would be, no. That's
being handled – AmeriHome is providing the leads and helping win the business. And then we have the
infrastructure on the traditional commercial bank side to absorb that business. And if we add – and if we have to
add people, it would be added on that side of the house where the expertise is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then how about on the gain on sale business, is there a variable component to that business? And with
gain on sale revenues coming down, should we expect a likewise reduction in some of their home costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Again, for some reason it's a little cloudy in what you're asking, but I think I got it. Yes, there is a variable
component of expenses there. AmeriHome has decreased its people count from the time that we bought them,
also decreased their people count expectation from the time that we bought them. And they run a pretty low cost
shop. So they're very quick to size up appropriately for the volume and the margins that they generate. We're very
confident that they move pretty quickly there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. About 60% of their costs are variable based upon kind of the volume counts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just lastly, in regards to the ATM that was exercised again this quarter, can you just remind
us if there's anything left on that program?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. The ATM has about 1.5 million shares in capacity, in itself. As we indicated, we think we can, kind of, grow
without it. I mean, in the first quarter we did take on some goodwill. And so, we had – covering that was the
reason, otherwise [ph] we wouldn't need to do it then (00:55:00) either. We also grew our mortgage servicing
rights, which are a little bit of a capital hog, but we think it made sense based upon valuation. But going forward
we don't see either of those kinds of things. It's back to the kind of the basics of the balance sheet. And that
balance sheet can handle more than $2 billion worth of loan growth per quarter without touching any external
capital sources.

Yeah. So I'll say, we do a loan pipeline meeting every week here and the loan pipeline is busy, active, clients
have not exhibited a reluctance to slow their growth plans, although they are mindful of the economic backdrop. I
am out with clients quite often, and they are still optimistic about their business, but as I said, mindful of the
economic backdrop. The beautiful thing that we have set up with AmeriHome is we can always bring in residential
loans to offset our liquidity. We are targeting our residential growth to be about 50% of our total loan growth.
And back to your question about loan growth, I think between the geographic and the business segment mix that
we have established in this company, we feel very comfortable with the growth guide that we gave and that
growth guide continuing into 2023. So, very active pipeline these days, so we're very comfortable, where the
future's taking us.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, our dependence on residential growth, which picked up during the pandemic, I think you're going to
see that wane here as these other channels become more robust. And frankly, capital call was a big player, and
we see capital call is maybe being an area of more accelerated growth in the near-term along with other
technology.

Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's all I had. Appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Just to follow-up on that comment, Dale, in terms of the growth in capital call and other tech, just maybe
stepping back, it seems like the innovation economy has gotten a bit of a karate chop lately what makes you so
confident about those segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Brock, I'm going to take this. This is Ken. First, a lot our capital call line and subscription line business is
really not to the innovation economy. It's more to the traditional brand name, PE firms and hedge [indiscernible]
(00:59:02) – basically PE-derived firms that you would know, and they are very active, they are raising lots of
funds. I was with one about that, three or four months ago and basically said to me, we can't get enough credit. I
was down at the lenders – the finance – the Fund Finance conference down in Miami a couple of weeks ago, and
again there too, just a huge demand for subscription lines and capital call lines. So, we're feeling optimistic about
that channel for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And another segment, warehouse have seen some really rough numbers across the sector here with little
recovery expected, you mentioned that quarter-to-date, there's been a pickup. Is that sign of the marketing effort
through AmeriHome gaining traction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, first, when we came into the year and we gave a $2 billion loan guide per quarter, we said we expected
the warehouse lending group to remain flat for the full-year and we still expect it to be flat for the full-year. We're
hopeful that it rises, but we are doing a lot of cross-selling. We've got a lot of loans now in underwriting from
AmeriHome's client base. And that's on the warehouse lending side and also on the MSR financing side as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks for the second round of questions.
