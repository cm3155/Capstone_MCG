Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Salvatore J. DiMartino
Executive Vice President & Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino. Thank you for joining the management team of New York
Community for today's conference call. Today's discussion of the company's first quarter 2022 results will be led
by Chairman, President and CEO, Thomas Cangemi; joined by Chief Operating Officer, Robert Wann; and the
company's Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto.
Before we begin our discussion, I'd like to remind you that certain comments made today by the management
team of New York Community may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements we make are subject to the Safe
Harbor rules. Please review the forward-looking disclaimer and Safe Harbor language in today's press release
and investor presentation for more information about the risks and uncertainties which may affect us.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Cangemi.

Thomas Robert Cangemi
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2022
performance. In addition to Robert and John, also joining on the line are Sandro DiNello, President and CEO of
Flagstar; and Lee Smith, President of Flagstar Mortgage.
In addition to our earnings release this morning, we announced that NYCB and Flagstar mutually agreed to
extend our merger agreement by approximately six months to October 31, 2022. In conjunction with the
expansion, both banks amended the merger agreement to provide that the combined company will operate under
a national bank charter. Although we recently received New York State DFS approval and we are very much
appreciative of this, both sides truly believe that a national bank charter is an appropriate charter for the new
organization.
Under the revised agreement, the necessary regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger will come
from the Fed Reserve and the OCC. Despite the expansion, the benefits of this transformational deal remain the
same today as it did when we announced the deal one year ago. The merger of our two great organizations
provides many benefits, including geographical and product diversification. It also accelerates our plan to
transform our business model to a multifaceted commercial bank [indiscernible] (00:02:30) strong, sustainable
financial performance and capital generation.
Additionally, it dramatically improves our overall funding profile and interest rate positioning. The combination of
our two balance sheets will create a pro forma balance sheet that is asset sensitive and significantly deposit
funded. Over the past 12 months, both sides have worked very closely together to get us into a position to close
the deal once regulatory approvals are received. We have a detailed integration plan in place. All major systems
[ph] have been determined (00:03:00) and my leadership team has been appointed. Both sides are ready to go.
And importantly, the deal still meets all of our financial metrics despite the change in interest rates and in the
mortgage business. We still forecast double-digit earnings per share accretion, while tangible book value

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
accretion is now expected to be 7% to 8% on day one, double what we envisioned when we initially announced
the deal. Having worked together over the past year, we feel very confident in our cost savings assumptions. And
while we have not modeled or assumed any revenue synergies, we know that there are multiple revenue
enhancement opportunities. More importantly, we are still not assuming any financial engineering such as
buybacks and balance sheet repositioning in our accretion numbers.
Turning now to our first quarter results. For the first quarter of 2022, we reported diluted earnings per share of
$0.32 a share, up 10% compared to $0.29 a share for the first quarter of 2021. We're extremely pleased with our
results this quarter as we reported, continued growth in loans, net income, earnings per share, and deposits as
well as lower operating expenses, margin expansion, and continued exceptional asset quality.
Turning now to the details of our quarterly performance. I would like to start off with the exceptional deposit
growth we reported for the quarter. Since I was appointed CEO on January 1st of last year, there's been a
significant cultural shift in our approach to bringing in deposits. During 2021, we embarked on a number of
initiatives designed to increase our deposits and lessen our reliance on alternative funding sources that are less
traditional in the commercial banking space such as wholesale borrowings. As a result, since year-end 2020 to
today, total deposits have increased $5.5 billion or 17% to $38 billion and core deposits have increased $8 billion
to $30 billion.
During the current first quarter, total deposits rose nearly $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
This was driven by growth in our Banking as a Service business as we continue to gain traction, add staff, launch
new initiatives in this area. Total BaaS-related deposits were $5.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a significant increase
since we started the business from scratch 12 months ago. BaaS-related deposits fall under three categories:
BaaS deposits tied to our fintech partnerships totaling $3.8 billion so far, government BaaS deposits of $709
million, and Mortgage as a Service deposits of $923 million.
Last year, we won several mandates for our Banking as a Service business. More recently, we were selected by
the Bureau of [ph] the Fiscal Service (00:05:46) as a financial agent for the US Treasury's prepaid debit card
program. This is a big win for us, and we should begin to see benefits materializing from this relationship later this
year. We also continue to make significant progress in garnering deposits from our borrowers. Total loan related
deposits rose $427 million during the first quarter to $4.4 billion, up 11% sequentially. This compares to growth of
$475 million for all of last year. All in all, since we began focusing on the source of funding early last year, we've
gotten over $900 million of incremental loan-related deposits, up 26% since year-end 2020.
In addition, earlier this year, we relaunched our direct-bank channel, MyBankingDirect.com. While it was just
rolled out in March, early receptivity has been very positive. We have an active pipeline of additional opportunities
that should benefit our deposit gathering initiatives, including those focusing on BaaS type of fintech companies.
Now moving on to loan growth. After $2 billion in loan growth during the fourth quarter of last year, total loans
grew by $1 billion during the first quarter to $46.8 billion, up 9% annualized on a linked quarter basis. Once again,
the majority of the growth was in the multifamily portfolio, which increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $35.8
billion, up 13% annualized compared to the previous quarter. Loan demand in the multifamily category continues
to be driven by increased refinancing activity, as the outlook in 2022 continues to call for higher interest rates,
higher property transactions and less competition from both other banks and GSEs.
The specialty finance portfolio of $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter was down $168 million compared to the
prior quarter. This was largely the result of one pay off, otherwise, the specialty finance portfolio would have been

relatively unchanged. At March 31, 2022, the specialty finance portfolio had $5.7 billion in total commitments, up
2% compared to year-end. Of that amount, 71% or $4 billion are structured as floating rate obligations.
With the recent increase in treasury rates, we've also increased our lending rates on multifamily loans several
times during the past quarter and we'll continue to do so as market rates increase. Our current multifamily pricing
is in the 4.5% to 4.75% range depending on the type of credit. That is about 100 basis points to 125 basis points
higher than at the end of last year. It's very important to note that we have approximately $8 billion of multifamily
and CRE loan that come up on their contractual maturity date or option repricing date over the next two years. So
borrowers have to act within that timeframe.
Despite the increase in rates, we still continue to have strong originations and a growing pipeline. Loan
originations continue their strong pace into the first quarter. Total first quarter originations were $3.5 billion, up $1
billion or 39% compared to the first quarter of last year. First quarter originations exceeded the previous quarter's
pipeline by $1.3 billion or 59%. Of the first quarter's originations, 42% were refinances in our portfolio, 34% were
refinances from other banks portfolio and 23% were due to property transactions. Speaking of the pipeline, the
pipeline heading into the second quarter of 2022 was a strong $2.5 billion compared to $2.2 billion last quarter, up
14%. Of this amount, 68% of the loans in the pipeline represented new money to the bank.
Moving now onto asset quality. Our credit trends in asset quality remains exceptional and continue to rank among
the best in the industry. Nonperforming assets totaled $70 million or 11 basis points of total assets as of March
31, while we charged off a mere $2 million during the quarter. Our delinquency trends continue to improve with
loans 30 to 89 days past due declining $33 million or 49% to $34 million compared to December 31, 2021. Lastly,
principal only loan deferrals declined 41% to $282 million compared to the previous quarter, and we continue to
have zero full payment deferrals.
Before proceeding, I'd like to provide an update on the New York City real estate market. The residential real
estate market in New York City has improved significantly. The rental market is currently facing strong demand
and low inventory levels as discounts and concessions expire, and rental prices approach new records.
Manhattan's median rent in March was at the highest level on record, although vacancy rate remained below 2%
for the fourth consecutive month. In Brooklyn, the median rent exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time
while new lease signing and [indiscernible] (00:10:26) reached a 10-year high.
Moving on to the income statement. First quarter net interest income rose 4% on a year-over-year basis.
Excluding the impact from prepayment, net interest income rose 8% on a year-over-year basis to $321 million. In
addition, excluding merger related expenses, first quarter pre-provision revenue increased 6% on a year-over-
year basis to $212 million. Turning to the net interest margin. Our margin for the first quarter was 2.43%.
Excluding the impact from prepayment income, the first quarter NIM was 2.35%, up 3 basis points on a linked
quarter basis and in line with our expectations.
On the expense side, we continue to be pleased with our expense discipline. Excluding merger-related expenses
of $7 million, operating expenses for the first quarter were $134 million, up $2 million or 2% on a year-over-year
basis. Our efficiency ratio remained below 40%. For the first quarter of the year, it was 38.65%. At yesterday's
meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.17 per share dividend on common shares. The dividend will be paid
on May 19 to common shareholders of record as of May 9. Based on yesterday's closing price, this translates to
an annualized dividend yield of 7%.

Lastly, I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to achieve another exceptional
quarter. With that, we would be happy to answer the questions you may have. We will do our very best to get to
all of you within the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or during the week.
Operator, please open the line for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Morning, Tom. I guess, first question, just in terms of the margin outlook, in light of the deal timing getting
pushed out, so two questions there. One, any additional clarity around when this deal could close? Is it – is there
a chance it still closes in the second quarter or should we be thinking more about 3Q or maybe even fourth
quarter given the extension date?
And secondly, tied to that, what does that mean for the core margin with the Fed expected to hike maybe 100,
150 basis points in the second quarter? I went back and saw – looked at like 2017, your margin went down 50
basis points year-over-year, fourth quarter 2017 over 2016. Just give us a sense because that's going to be a
concern around what happens to NYB margin in light of the Fed actions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, let me just point out the big picture view of us and Flagstar coming together, [ph] they're (00:13:31)
asset sensitive or liability sensitive. I would say, we're probably less liability sensitive today than we were when
we cited that move. So we take a very significant asset sensitive bank like Flagstar, and we consummate the
merger this year. This will have, in my opinion, a very positive position in a rising rate environment going into
2023. So we're very appreciative of the balance sheet coming together with unique positioning, us being slightly
liability sensitive and Flagstar being asset sensitive. So collectively, when we come together, going into 2023, it
will positioned well for that rising rate environment.
That being said, I'm going to defer to Mr. Pinto on the short-term guidance on the [audio gap] (00:14:13). John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. For the second quarter, we expect the net interest margin ex-prepays to be flat to Q1. And we have a
couple of things going on in the quarter. We – as we've talked on our last calls, we have the full benefit of the
hedge rolling off – that rolled off in February. So we have some – we [ph] are flat for (00:14:31) the second

quarter. And then depending on what happens with interest rates, we'll see what happens in the third and fourth
quarter. There'll be some pressure on the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And, John, what are you assuming for Fed to do in the second quarter as part of that flat margin guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
50/50. 50 basis points in May, 50 basis points in June.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And, Tom, any thoughts around the timing of the deal, like is the OCC approval in that process, will
it be – will it by default push it out into later in the year or is there a likelihood the deal closes in the second
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we were very clear in our press release this morning that we put out on October 30 data out there, and we're
comfortable with that timeframe based on where we are in the regulatory process. We can't really dive into
specifically but, we're hopeful that we will meet that timeframe. And we feel that's a reasonable timeframe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one last question, maybe for Lee. Gain on sale, reset lower, I don't think totally surprising in the
first quarter for Flagstar. We didn't see any expense offset. Would love to hear, one, where do you think gain on
sale goes from here? And is there anything on the expense side that you can do that offsets that revenue that
we've seen over the last couple of quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for that question. So, yeah, margins are obviously under pressure given the excess capacity in the
system at the moment. We've gone from a $4.4 trillion market last year and right now they're forecasting a $2.8
trillion market. So, people are working to remove that capacity. But until it's gone, it's going to put pressure on
margins. What I would say, when you look at our margin, we were down 43 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A
big piece of that was the EBOs. We had $26 million of gain on sale benefit in the fourth quarter and we had $5
million in Q1. So, when you look at that reduction of 43 basis points quarter-over-quarter, 23 basis points was
because of the EBOs. And then you had about 11 basis points mix and volatility and 9 basis points was
competitiveness, and that's just waiting for that excess capacity to exit the system.
In terms of what we've done from a cost point of view, remember, 70% to 75% of our mortgage costs are variable
or semi-variable. So, we have that flexibility, but we have taken additional actions. We've rightsized that
infrastructure. And unfortunately, we've had to layoff 358 employees in two waves, one at the end of March and
one at the end of April. And then a further 62 employees have attrited that we haven't replaced for a total
reduction of 420 since 12/31. To put that into perspective, that's a 20% reduction in our total mortgage employees

since 12/31, or 25% of our mortgage operation staff. In terms of what impact that has from a dollar point of view,
we think it will save us about $4.4 million, $4.5 million in the second quarter. And then going forward from Q3
onwards, it will be about $6 million in savings.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Hey, good morning. Just a question on the Banking as a Service deposits. Can you speak to the rates that
are currently being paid on those and your expectations for betas as the Fed moves? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm going to just take it in general. We've been very successful with this initiative. And our focus on dealing with
our fintech partnerships, in particular dealing with government opportunities, the typical depositor relationship
there is zero cost for that type of relationship. That should kick in as more programs come to place and Treasury
Department starts rolling out new initiatives. And as the government starts to deal with the various agencies and
how they're going to distribute card-like programs, we will get the benefit of zero float there.
As far as the other deposits, it varies. Mortgage as a Service is typically tied towards LIBOR either plus or minus a
spread. And then when you look at the fintech partnerships, they can go from zero to as – to LIBOR less some
type of spread, depending on the relationship. We were very fortunate in the quarter to win a very unique piece of
business. We are one of the few banks – I think it's one of six, to deal with fiat-based stablecoin exchanges that
we hold reserve accounts for. That is a new initiative of ours as we focus on stablecoin. This has been a very
successful venture for us and we continue to look at that as opportunistic.
At the same time, we have a significant amount of partnerships that we're working on onboarding and we're
building staff around that [indiscernible] (00:19:52) true fintech partnership of Banking as a Service for a lot of
these challenger institutions that have banking operations, but they're not an FDIC-insured institution. So, we are
working as the bank provider and the Banking as a Service provider for those types of initiatives, but they do vary.
And the goal here is that, that coupled with a significant push towards getting our fair share of deposits from our
customers on the loan side is our strategy for the future. And it's been very successful since last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And if I could add one more. I think you said in the prepared remarks, tangible book accretion is going to
be 2x what you thought. Can you help with where you believe CET1 will shake out and kind of remind us what
either if that's your binder or which one your binder is? Thanks.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say [indiscernible] (00:20:39) the Flagstar transaction closing were probably higher on a Tier 1 capital
perspective, probably hovering close to 11%. So, I think maybe John Pinto could add some more color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Originally, we anticipated a Tier 1 common equity ratio to be 10.4%. So just given the growth in tangible
book, that will be slightly higher. So, it'll probably be just under 11% right now is our estimate.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you give more color on the decision to go the route of the national bank
charter? And you said you received NYSDFS approval. Was the FDIC a roadblock in getting this deal approved?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I'm not going to comment on any agency. I will tell you that we truly believe that with the national banking
platform, and where we're heading the bank in the future that the OCC charter is the way to go. So, clearly, we're
much – very much appreciative of DFS approval. And I'm not going to comment on any other regulatory
discussions there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. But what – can you go into the decision to switch to the national charter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I just did. As we – and I do appreciate the question, and it can be sensitive on the commentary, but we went
through a journey through this process. It's now a year through the approval process. As we went through this
process, we feel very confident that the business model is focused on a national mortgage banking platform and a
national commercial banking platform that will be more inclined for an OCC charter.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Tom, will there be any additional costs or oversight with this type of charter versus previous?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would say in general, well, it's probably going to be very similar to the structure with respect to costs. I think the
efficiencies of the mortgage banking business, there may be some savings on licensing and things of that nature
and complexities around states and municipal deposits and things of that nature. But overall, it would be
immaterial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And in terms of the Fed and OCC now, has that process been ongoing, or are you now just starting that
process with them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Steven, you would assume that the Fed has had our applications since May of last year, so they're very
familiar with the process. We gave a relatively short window to get this closed, which is October, which is two
quarters from now, six months. And we're confident that, that's the adequate timeframe to achieve these approval,
based on where we are in the approval process.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, finally, so if I look at New York Community, right, the company has made a lot of progress in 15
months' time. Since you've been CEO, you're changing a lot on the funding side. We know the market, at least at
the moment, it's not a fan of the mortgage banking business. And if you look at Flagstar's 1Q results, you can get
a sense [ph] why we're (00:23:41) talking about gain on sale margins compressing so much. And here you
extended the merger agreement. I'm not suggesting you should have called the deal off, but can you walk us
through, so you made the decision to extend. What does this give you that you couldn't have accomplished on
your own? Like why did it make sense for NYCB shareholders here to extend the agreement? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Steven, so again, we're not going to waver from our original discussion. We put the deal in front of both
Sandro and I, we looked at this opportunity. We had an opportunity here to look at the mortgage business with full
knowledge that 2022 will be dramatically less than it was in 2021. We modeled down 55%. So, I would say what
we know of the company right now based on their forecast, we're right in line what we expected. This is not a
surprise.
With that being said, the deposit rich franchise and transforming this company into a full service commercial bank
from a traditional thrift model is a catalyst. We've done so much work around what the opportunities on revenue

diversified and a national footprint. We believe we feel very strongly about the transaction. As I said in my opening
remarks, we're very confident on the financial merits of the transaction. It's a well-structured transaction. We're

very comfortable with the mortgage business. We know the mortgage business. But more importantly, we
anticipated a substantial drop.
And if you look at what the history of what Flagstar has done from transitioning their own balance sheet, they're
well along the way becoming more of a full service commercial bank. They've moved well past that 50% of their
balance sheet, which is commercial banking assets. So, we're in a path to accelerate the transformation under
new leadership at NYCB to combine into a very well thought out way to take a traditional model, which could take
a decade to transform into a much accelerated path. So, we truly are – feel confident that this is a significant
opportunity to really change the financial metrics of this company towards shareholder value with a well-rounded,
diversified balance sheet with a vision of a unique commercial banking model.

Tom, on the deal accretion comment you made, you mentioned you still see double-digit EPS accretion for the
deal. Are you still in line with that 16% you've been talking about previously? And then, if you are in line with that,
can you just talk about what you're assuming for that mortgage revenue and the warehouse book size you're
baking into that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Dave, let me be clear. I'm not going to give guidance for 2023 and 2024. When we put the deal together, this
was a double-digit accretive deal. Correct, the number was 16%. We don't have 2023, 2024 guidance and there's
not a lot of guidance [indiscernible] (00:26:28) what we see with Flagstar right now that's public. So, when you
look at the numbers on a spot basis, our tangible book value is more than doubled on the accretion side to 8%
approximately. We believe this is a double-digit accretive deal. We don't have public guidance, but we're very
confident that putting these companies together without any liability reshuffling, without any buybacks, without any

financial engineering, we have a very well-structured transaction that can create good shareholder value and

Okay. Maybe just going into the deposit growth, you had solid deposit growth this quarter, and I know the Banking
as a Service piece contributed to that. Can you maybe just size the amount of deposits at those customers that
you onboarded this quarter that maybe haven't yet come on to the balance sheet at this point, if you're still
bringing those in? And then, it sounds like you've got more customers that are coming in later this year. Can you
just maybe size the pipeline of those customers that you're seeing coming in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, look, we were very cautious when we had our change of strategy about a year-and-a-half ago. And
obviously, on the loan side, we're being very cautious. But it's a lot of hard work and it's a mandate. It's a cultural
mandate. And we're doing great work there, up 26% since we started that initiative. And I was very cautious on
giving the Street specificity around how much we can take from what's ours, which is our deposit to our
customers. Well, it's been successful. That's been moving very well. That is a passion at the board level all the
way down to the line, so that's moving very nicely for us. That's how we do business going forward.
And on the BaaS side, where we continue to onboard some great people, especially in the [ph] middle where
(00:28:04) to get the onboarding efficiently. Our team is all geared up and we have an online pipeline. That's a
very unique opportunities. As mentioned – I mentioned, we're now one of the – one of – I think, one of six banks
approved, one of the largest fiat-based stablecoin provider in the world. That's a significant win for the company.
It's small now, but that could grow very nicely. And at the same time, we have a number of initiatives. So I would
say, you're going to see continued deposit growth every quarter. That's the goal. I'm not going to tell you we're
going to be up $3 billion every quarter. But the good news is that as we bring in this excess liquidity and we price
it accordingly, we feel that we could be competitive and we have some really good talent that we brought in as
part of our digital platform.
We've brought someone in very talented who ran $100 million book, and there's a lot of relationship opportunities
out there that we think we can tap, and we're going to be very creative on the technology side. There is a need for
a bank of our size versus some of the smaller banks that are under $10 billion that truly emphasize their capacity
on [indiscernible] (00:29:03). So we're focusing on more funding opportunities. So eventually, we believe that
these relationships will tie into other lines of businesses, hopefully on the lending side and more importantly, on
the fee side. So this is a strategy that we're focusing on.
We mentioned a little bit about My Banking Direct. My Banking Direct over the long-term will be our digital
platform. And we're going to roll out a full service digital challenger bank as an alternative solution for customers.
And hopefully, it could be a solution for the [ph] underserved underbanked (00:29:32). But we have a lot of unique
technology and have a strong team of new hires that are working with us to gather that business. So, it's a focus
of the bank. We had some great success. On the government side, it's been very successful. We won about I
think three specific deals last year, and those deals will start to kick in over time and they're both fee related. And
those types of transactions are zero-cost deposits.
Now, a lot of the other stuff on the mortgage side is where we want to get significant benefit when you tie into
what Flagstar does as a business model. Being a substantial wholesale provider for mortgage warehouse, they
have tremendous relationships. Collectively, they're not looking for that liquidity. We will come in and be the

Banking as a Service partner. So, I think there's a real great opportunity there as a Banking as a Service partner
for mortgage. So, Mortgage as a Service is [audio gap] (00:30:21) initiative. We have about $1 billion book going
into the consummation of the deal. We think that number can expand dramatically. They run around $6 billion as
Flagstar standalone, but that number can significantly increase.
Maybe Sandro can give some color on that opportunity that they don't go after right now because of the lack of
desire for balance sheet purposes. Sandro, maybe you want to add some color there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Tom. Thank you. Look, as you saw in the Flagstar numbers, our balance sheet shrunk a little bit in
the first quarter principally due to the lower available-for-sale balances as well as the lower warehouse balances.
And while they're still substantial, they are less than they were a quarter ago. And so we're not pursuing those
opportunities that Tom has referenced and I think it's an opportunity that's very, very significant in the billions of
dollars relative to the additional deposits that can be brought in through our warehouse customers, as well as our
MSR partners. So, I think that's very significant.
And it's one of the reasons why, at Flagstar, we've been able to adjust to a changing market. You look – if you
look at our guidance, what you see is that the model that we've been building is beginning to work. And it's
showing that it does work in both the rising and falling interest rate market. When rates were low in the last two
years, our mortgage business thrived and we reported record earnings. And now that interest rates are rising, we
are seeing our non-origination businesses really beginning to thrive. As you saw in our earnings deck, our margin
hit a new high of 3.19% in March, all-time high. And we're guiding to that expanding to almost 3.60% in Q2 and
with it continuing to increase throughout the year to average close to 3.60%, closing out the year, maybe, north of
3.70% in December.
And our MSR investment, which has always performed in an outstanding fashion, has had a much higher return in
Q1, particularly in March, as we eased our hedges and saw a nice valuation increase. So we're guiding to an
elevated return on our MSR for the year. And as you [indiscernible] (00:32:34) we don't have any delinquent
commercial loans. So we're pretty confident about the credit quality and we will be keeping an eye on expenses
and keeping them in the range where they currently are.
So, while the mortgage environment is difficult, we have right-sized it. And despite modest expectations for gain-
on-sale for the year, I'm really quite optimistic that our full year results will be very strong and Q1 will play out to
be a transitional quarter given that the velocity of the increased mortgage rates in the quarter was the highest in
something like 40 years, and we really didn't see the benefit of the Fed's actions until mid-March. So, I think all of
these things, together with the liquidity opportunities that we bring to the balance sheet for an efficiently priced
deposits, when you put these two organizations together, as Tom has already suggested a couple of times, we
think that's really, really a powerful balance sheet and opportunity for shareholder growth – shareholder value
growth.

Appreciate all the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
One thing I would add to your comment on beta risk. I will tell you that, in our opinion, unless you have
transactional deposits at zero, with an elongated period of zero interest rates for so long, I believe all deposit side
pricing is going to rise in an aggressive Fed tightening cycle. So, interestingly, you can say things that are tied to
short-term LIBOR [indiscernible] (00:33:58) tied to [indiscernible] (00:34:00) high beta risk type liabilities.
But ultimately, as yield becomes 50, 50 becomes 100, I would say that in general, the Fed's in a tightening mode.
And I think all liabilities with the exception of demand deposits tied to customers and [ph] we call it (00:34:15)
maybe savings to a lesser extent, they're going to have high value risk in general. So we assume this is going to
be more of an industry phenomenon, not just because we're a slightly liability sensitive. This is going to be, in my
opinion, a beta risk environment, and I think we will prepare for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. That make sense. Maybe if I could sneak in one more, I knew you have sort of all advances. What's your
expectation just given the current curve as to what kind of [indiscernible] (00:34:40) this year? I know you've got
some cash there. You can take some of that off. Do you think you can pay all that off with deposit growth in cash?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So let me give you a general view and I'll let John be more specific. But big picture is that in the event that [ph]
just to (00:34:53) put back to us, we're in a deposit growing initiative. We're in a liability gathering initiative. So
we'll have lots of flexibility. And more importantly, when we merge with Flagstar, we're going to have a
tremendous opportunity to really reshuffle our liability position, rightsize ourselves into 2023 and 2024. So that's
my broad view of what we're going to do with things coming back at us and things that put back to us. But if they
put back, we have the cash, we're in a great position.
So maybe John could add some more color to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, depending on what happens with short-term interest rate this quarter, it is possible that we'll get a
handful [ph] of portable (00:35:27) borrowings back to us. But as Tom mentioned, when you look at us from an
interest rate risk perspective, since these are quarterly [indiscernible] (00:35:33) and just about all of our interest
rate increasing scenarios, we assume these are getting put anyway. So even if you replaced it with high beta
deposits from an interest rate risk perspective, you'd be in the same perspective. And from an earnings
perspective, you'd be a little bit better because the individual coupons that are coming on are coming on lower
than where the [indiscernible] (00:35:53) are coming off. So it could be a benefit that we could see in the short
term as these things get put back to us. And the goal is to pay them off with deposits and just continue the less of
a reliance on wholesale funding.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brock.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, Tom. Good morning. Just following up on with the Flagstar team. I look at your deposit growth. It's
pretty muted. Non-interest bearing down about 20% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. I assume some of that's
mortgage related. If you could just talk about what's going on there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It's totally – this is Sandro. It's totally related to the mortgage business. So as I mentioned earlier, with the
balance sheet declining, we've left some of those servicing related deposits go, escrow deposits, and so forth and
lower. So, that's it's managing the size of the balance sheet or the size of the funding that we need for the balance
sheet. So it's all planned. The retail deposits, consumer deposits, commercial deposits are all moving in the right
direction as they have historically. So, this is just our ability to manage the wholesale deposits in a way that fits
best for the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, Sandro. It's Lee. If I can just jump in. It is all escrow deposits. Obviously, escrow deposits are higher when
you've got a lower rate environment and there's more payoffs. And as rates rise and you have lower payoffs, that
is you see a reduction in the escrow deposit. So, it's all escrow deposit related, Brock.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And shifting back to the gain-on-sale margin to beat that horse a little bit more. Is this the – could this be
the trough or what are you seeing in your current production in terms of gross margin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It's hard to know because, as Lee said in his remarks earlier, everybody is adjusting capacity. Some
companies are not going to make it. We're kind of where we were two years ago, right, not too much before
COVID hit. And so it takes a while. But if you look at our guidance, we're being very careful on the guidance for

gain on sale. So, even with that lower guidance, when you put all of the numbers into your model, I think you'll see
that Flagstar number is still pretty darn good. And as Tom said, consistent with what was projected a year ago
when we put the transaction together, although the composition of the earnings is very different because the
mortgage earnings is down quite a bit, and then the banking and servicing earnings are up quite a bit. And again,
as I said earlier, that's exactly how this model was intended to work on the Flagstar side.

Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe just following up on the stablecoin partnership. I hear you on your comments, Tom. Just
kind of curious, are those deposits going to be indexed or are they going to be non-interest bearing? And should
we think about those as interchangeable to what CDs are scheduled to reprice? And if you guys could quantify
also what – how many dollar value of CDs scheduled to reprice?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

A
Fiat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Fiat – yeah, the stablecoin fiat currencies. They're usually tied to fed funds, either target or effective fed funds,
minus some sort of a spread depending on the type. So, they are floating rate against fed funds, but they are to a
minus spread. And then, when you look at CDs where they're coming due, we have about $3.8 billion in maturing
CDs in the second quarter and that's at a 45 basis point rate. So, yes, if you think about it, the gains that we have
on these kinds of deposits can help offset some CD runoff, if we have it.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning, Tom. The loan growth was exceptionally strong this quarter and you raised
guidance in January to upper single digits. I'm just wondering if you – how you're thinking about loan growth going
forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, it's an exciting transition period given the – fourth quarter was interesting given property transactions were
elevated, a lot of activity, a lot of smart moves from borrowers to get refinanced, try to get access to their capital.
So, you saw a lot of that in Q4. They continued in Q1. Rates are dramatically higher, Peter. So, if you think about
where we are in the market, we're still between [indiscernible] (00:42:02) five-year money. We're not really in the
10-year market much at all [ph] and the 7 (00:42:06). It's mostly a five-year product. And if you look at the shape
of the curve, we feel very confident that our customers are going to – we're going to have – our retention is going
to be much higher. I think the last month of the quarter, retention was close to 69%. It was very high, which is a
very good turn for the company. So, that will transition to more growth.
So, I think it's fair to say that we're looking at a high-single-digit net loan growth story for 2022 on a standalone
basis, excluding Flagstar. So, that's unique since we had a very strong Q1. But what's interesting about that, as I
just discussed on my prepared remarks, we have about $8 billion that's going to have to make a decision in the

next 24 months. And I think the coupon and that's probably in the low-3s. So, this is going to, in my opinion,
accelerate prepayment activity. We'll be able to hold on to more fee income there and be more resilient on
ensuring that we get our economics given the rising rate environment.
And as customers realize that cap rates may rise a little bit here and LTVs may be more conservative as a matter,
of course, of conservatism, you probably want to access your capital sooner, so it could go into a very strong
2022 for a lot of acceleration within the customer base itself. At the same time, there's a lot of property
transactions. If you look at the New York City marketplace, it's rich. There's transactions happening and we
haven't seen a lot post the pandemic. So it started to kick in, in Q4 and it's continuing. So we're very bullish about
the activity that we're seeing in the multifamily space. And by the way, all the borrowers are very strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's really helpful. If I could ask about the margin. I guess two questions. Just one, John, how much of
the benefit in terms of the margin for the full quarter impact from the swap rolling off in the second quarter? And
then secondly, I'm just wondering if you could quantify what the impact is to either the margin or net interest
income for every 25 basis point increase in rates and the deposit betas that you're assuming?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. For the – on your first point, the benefit of – in the margin we saw from the swap rolling off this quarter was
4 basis points. So that's the $2 billion swap that rolled off on February 15. So we had half of the benefit in the first
quarter and then the rest of the full benefit on a run rate basis this quarter. We're not going to give guidance on
specific 25 basis point increases. We realize we are liability sensitive. There are deposits. A lot of the deposits
that we brought in are tied to fed funds. So, there will be an impact as we go forward. But we'll manage that as
individual deposits come through and we bring in new relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
If I could ask then maybe...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I just want to go back to John's point. So, think about, on the big picture, we have this asset sensitive institution
that has – will have the [ph] fresher (00:45:05) liquidity opportunities, and we're less liability sensitive today than
we were three, four years ago, and definitely within the last rate tightening cycle. So when we take that all things
being equal, put that together, you have a very unique opportunity to position this company into a changing
interest rate environment that's going to benefit the margin going forward. So that's our view when we model this.
This is all about putting the strength of these two companies together. But when you think about the business
model, they have a lot of low cost funding [ph] over (00:45:35) Flagstar that will hold very nicely transactional type
money. At the same time, we have this beautiful opportunity on the mortgage side where we can really be a major
depository player regarding relationship opportunities. So we think there's going to be a growth opportunity for
liquidity and being able to really transition our balance sheet from wholesale funding. And that's going to be the
focus of the combined entity. And the combined entity will have an asset sensitive position going into a rising rate
environment.

level. We redid it as of our last go round. So yeah, between 5% and 8% is our NII sensitivity.

If you think about what we've accomplished since 2020, at the end of 2021, 2022, our core deposit franchise is
up, I think, $8 billion. $5.5 billion on the lending side. So these are solid relationship deposits. The goal here is to
culturally change how we do business, and that's the mandate. And I think we're making tremendous success
here. So I'll be patient. We're not going to give quarterly guidance on how much loan deposits that we're going to
bring in every quarter. But we've been successful, and it's been a cultural shift on how we conduct our business.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Going back to the charter discussion, I was curious, does the FDIC have any remaining say on your charter
change at the OCC? And is the charter change contingent upon the deal or are you going to make the switch
standalone prior to or regardless of the deal close?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'm not going to say a whole lot about what can happen. The reality is, is that, we have the DFS approval. We
believe that this company's position is better served as an OCC charter on a combined basis. And that's the
direction we're heading. As far as commentary on what could happen, what may happen, the reality is that we're
seeking a Fed charter – a Fed approval and an OCC approval. And we put out a date, which is October 31. We
feel that we can meet those approval dates, that's the plan. We've been through this process for a year now. So, I
think we learned as we went along here and this is the path that we believe for a national mortgage banking
platform that's going to have 400 retail locations throughout the country, 100 LOA offices, and a commercial
banking model that would serve under the OCC charter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. The other thing is, if you screen for US banks with elevated CRE concentrations, most often you come
across institutions that are FDIC and state regulated. Many of them are in New York, but very, very few are over
300% and regulated by the OCC. Now, at year-end, I think you were at 765%. And with the deal, you're still north
of 300%, but lower than 765%. So, do you need to make any changes on this end to lower your CRE
concentrations ahead of the charter change?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:48:52) Let me give you just a general overview and I want to kind of cite history here going
back to 2006 guidance. When the guidance was put out in 2006, it was very clear that well structured multifamily
housing was uniquely positioned when it's perceived regarding this concentration. When you look at our company
combined basis and you take out cooperatives, which is – our average LTV is 25% and rent-regulated cash flows,
we will be pro forma under 300%. If you take out multifamily as just a position that's not considered high risk CRE,
we're at 112%.
So, again, we have a unique business model that has decades of zero losses in the asset class. We've spent
hundreds of millions of dollars over the years as we look to become a [ph] C-corp bank (00:49:42) going back to
2012 up to 2016 on making sure we have very strong risk management practices around CRE. But when you
think about the business model [indiscernible] (00:49:55) predominantly in multifamily rent-regulated housing and
we have a relatively significant cooperative portfolio with a mid-20% LTVs that we've never had a nickel of loss
ever as a company. So, these are very unique positions for history. So, when you take that, all things being equal,
and look at where your true CRE position would be, when you carve out multifamily and cooperatives, it's about
112% pro forma. So, I think it's manageable and we have a very interesting story to tell regarding credit history.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And then, along those lines, the other question they had was, I was curious of your thoughts on the
health of the rent-regulated multifamily borrowers given limitations on rent increases from the RGB. But in this

inflationary environment, you could envision higher court expenses, particularly on the energy front. As we go
through the year, if there's minimum kind of allowed rent increases, do you think there's going to be any problems
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Matt, that's a great question. I will tell you that we've – three years ago, we focused on that, obviously, when we
had the rent law changes [indiscernible] (00:50:57) four years ago. And the reality is that we look at the Bronx
very differently than some of the other markets and we lend differently in those markets. But there's no question
that as inflation outpaced revenue growth on the cash flow side, you have some pressure there. So what we do,
we do a lot of stress testing around risk management. In particular, we've carved out the Bronx's portfolio with
significant detail. Some of our largest players are in the Bronx have significant portfolios. And we believe that we
have really low LTV, great borrowers, a history of long duration and – long duration hold periods and generational
holdings.
And we feel very confident that our asset stress testing is in very, very adverse scenarios. We're comfortable that
we have a solid portfolio. But it's simple math, right? So, I have a feeling that as inflation continues to be more of a
challenge for these customers, there will be less ability to do a cash-out refi and there have to be more accelerate
to come to the table sooner. So, I think it was probably going to bring a lot of borrowers to the table a lot quicker
just because of the potential of the squeeze. And we're going to be probably more conservative on LTVs. But we
do have a relatively low LTV portfolio, especially in the rent-regulated cash flow portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's a great question. It's definitely [indiscernible] (00:52:13) great question. And we appreciate that
commentary because we spent a lot of time getting comfortable on the risk management side. And I think that's
something that we've got a good arms around it, we feel really good about it and we've done a ton of work about –
around – on the rent control area given the changes in rent laws and the nuances on how cash flows are created.
And it's a different environment, say, than it was a decade ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
The other question I had, just to flip sides and go to Flagstar is, on page 14 of their deck, their mortgage custodial
deposits is around $5 billion. I was hoping to just get a little bit of a better understanding of what those are. What
are those? Who are they from? What's the anticipated beta for that book? And the other thing is, what's driving
the volatility imbalances?

Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Go ahead. Go ahead, Sandro. Go ahead. Go ahead, Sandro.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It's – the held for – the available-for-sale portfolio and the servicing portfolio has deposits associated with it.
And the servicing portfolio, when rates are declining, the payoffs are very, very significant. And so you're holding
payoffs during the course of the month. And so your escrow balances are much, much higher than when you're in
a rising rate environment and the prepayments are very, very low. So, almost all of that is related to that
phenomenon.
The beta on those, so the escrow deposits carry no – if we own the MSR, the escrow deposit carry no cost. If it's
– and connected with a sub-servicing arrangement, then we pay the MSR owner some level of deposits typically
LIBOR-ish, and that's really it. And if you look at the history of Flagstar, you'll see that our – we have the ability to
manage that volatility very well because there's kind of gives and takes. As you're in that higher interest rate
environment, prepayments are slower. You have less escrow deposits. But at the same time, the available-for-
sale portfolio is lower because originations are lower. So, they kind of offset each other. And again, there's a lot of
history there that you can look at as you begin to understand Flagstar better. And it's not a problematic volatility, if
you will.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I'll just jump in. And Sandro has hit the nail on the head. Think of the deposits that you're looking at on
page 14. They're entirely related to our servicing or sub-servicing book. So, the $1.3 million loans that we service
or sub-service, some of which we own and some of which we sub-service for others. And to Tom's point, when he
talks about Mortgage as a Service, we could go and get more of those deposits. We just have chosen not to
because we haven't needed to given we've got ample deposit capacity to fund the balance sheet that we have.
But when we bring the two organizations together, that's an area where we could go and seek additional deposit
growth.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Hey. Good morning, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. So you're no stranger to recessions.
You've seen many of your career. And if we have one in the next year or two or whenever, it seems that your
reserves are really strong relative to any hypothetical charge-off rate. So I'm just curious kind of how you manage
the reserve from here? Do you think it will grow? It seems you've got a lot of leeway with the reserve and just kind
of want to talk through that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. I'm going to defer to John Pinto regarding the complexities around the new accounting for loan reserve. So,
John, why don't you piggyback at that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. There's no doubt that there's some opportunity there, but we are growing the loan portfolio as well. So,
under CECL and the life of loan estimate, you got to put up those full potential life of loan losses the day you do
the loan. So that will offset some of that. So you'll have the growth in the portfolio, some benefits. We've seen
continued benefits in the macroeconomic forecast recently even given what's been going on right now.
So when you're looking at where we are from a macroeconomic and our individual portfolio metrics, you are very
comfortable with where we are here. I wouldn't say we'll see substantial declines or increases unless something
dramatic happens in the economy, but I do think that there's an ability to offset some of that growth in the portfolio
in those provisions as we go forward, as long as the macroeconomic indicators stay relatively consistent with
where they are today.
[indiscernible] (00:57:14)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would say historically the company has a very conservative view of an in-place cash flow lender. Our
focus has been of conservatism. And historically, if you look at the statistics, you can run this out 20, 30 years, –
close to 30 years, we have very little losses based on actual experience. So, we're very confident on how we lend
culturally, and that's not changing.
If anything, in a recessionary environment, we'll just be more conservative. And I think that's important for
customers to understand as they start to significantly rise, if we're heading into a recession, and the rates starting
to rise, and ultimately, these lower coupons have to refinance, there may be less money to take out based on
what the value they've created over the past five to seven years, so it's [ph] not an (00:58:01) accelerant. And
when they come to the table, the cash flow is going to be – the net cash flow to them, given the carry cost is
lower, so you're giving less dollars and it's almost an incentive for them to come to the table sooner before cap
rates follow interest rate increases.
At the same time, we have a history here. We were an in-place cash flow lender. We don't look at what the future
is going to hold for property transactions, what's in place, and that's our conservative outlook as being a cash flow
[ph] lender for (00:58:27) portfolio.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I know we've gone over time. Just a very quick question, maybe for John. The
tangible book value accretion you mentioned, what's driving that? Is it just purely based on the interest rate mark
today versus when you announced the deal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:59:01) tangible book value creation on the transaction...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That – we're using – the guidance that Tom gave has got an estimate of where the mark would be as of the
March 31st. So, that does move around, no doubt, right, so that could change. But that's a really an all-inclusive
number is what we are – where we expecting to come out. If you look at where we were at the beginning when we
announced the transaction, we would add a pretty significantly higher credit mark on the portfolio and just look at
the allowance that the CECL results that Flagstar had when we announced the deal compared to now, and then
that, of course, will be offset by our rate mark. So, we'll have a much higher rate mark on the portfolio and a much
lower credit mark on the portfolio when you're looking at loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think, obviously, [ph] in just (00:59:45) valuation perspective, when you put the deal together on accounting
perspective, you've got negative goodwill, I would imagine, John.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
This transaction, given the current landscape, that could obviously change as we get closer to closing. But if you
look at the past year, Flagstar had a tremendous 2021 economically. So, that goes into the capital [indiscernible]
(01:00:04) and when you reset the transaction on an accounting perspective, we have a lot more capital there.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just one final question, Tom. Any risk to the dividend as you go through the OCC process to get the
deal approved? I know [indiscernible] (01:00:28) fine. You're going to have excess capital, but just would love to
hear in terms of your confidence in the dividend sustainability?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We're very confident in our position to return value back to shareholders and our priority is to continue maintaining
our current dividend position. And obviously, when we model this, the payout ratio based on the pro formas
comes down significantly. So, we still believe that that's the case and our focus is to continue maintaining our
dividend, and we're going to hold to that assumption.
