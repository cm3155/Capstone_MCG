Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B.. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the third quarter results for
Cullen/Frost. Jerry is going to make some additional comments and then we're going to open it up for your
questions.
In the third quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $154 million or $2.38 a share, compared with earnings of $168.1 million
or $2.59 a share reported in the same quarter last year. Our return on average assets and average common
equity in the third quarter were 1.25% and 18.93%, respectively, and that compares with 1.27% and 2.13% for the
same period last year. This solid performance can be attributed to the execution of our sustainable organic growth
strategy and the commitment to our culture that develops deep customer relationships and provides world-class
customer service. And all this happens because of the hard work and dedication of our Frost Bank staff.
As in the past, our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remained strong. As an example, at quarter end, our
cash liquidity deferred equaled 17% of our deposit base. Also during the quarter, Cullen/Frost did not take on any
federal home loan bank advances, participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing, access any
broker deposits, or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangement to build insured deposit percentages. Let me also
say our available for sale portfolio represents 82% of our portfolio at quarter end. So, in short, basically with our
balance sheet, what you see is what you get.
Our average deposits were stable in third quarter at $40.8 billion, less than a percent change from the previous
quarter. Average loans grew to $18 billion in the third quarter, compared to $17.7 billion in the second quarter, an
annualized growth rate of 6.8%.
As I mentioned, we're laser-focused on our efforts to achieve organic growth, and I'm very pleased with our
results. For example, to update you on our physical expansion efforts for our combined Houston expansions, we
stand at 107% of deposit goal, 162% of loan goal, and 127% of our new household goal. As of quarter end,
expansion loans represented 22% and deposits represented 18% of our total Houston market presence. For the
Dallas market, we stand at 292% of deposit goal, 273% of loan goal, and 216% of our new household goal.
While still relatively early in this effort, expansion loans and deposits represent approximately 9% respectively of
Dallas market totals and we're excited about our new Austin expansion effort, which has opened the first of 17
planned locations to double our presence in that market.
But beyond these overall numbers, I wanted to take you a little deeper into the character of the expansion
business. For example, in Houston, we stand at $1.4 billion in deposits and $1 billion in loans. Our deposit mix is
53% commercial and 47% consumer, essentially mirroring our company profile. Two-thirds of the deposit
relationships are under $1 million, and only four are over $10 million. Loans are73% commercial, 27% consumer,
and only eight customers have over $10 million.
Similarly, in Dallas, of our $325 million in deposits, 53% are consumer versus 47% commercial. And 72% of those
deposits were under $1 million. No relationships, over $10 million. Our $258 million in loans are 62% consumer
and 38% commercial, which I think is remarkable.
The reason I labored through that detail is to show you that the kind of business we've been successful
generating in our expansion is core, stable, grassroots business, which I believe will generate tremendous value
over an extended period of time. I'm very pleased with the results of these efforts, and I believe that this strategy
is both scalable and durable, and I'm convinced we'll be doing this for a long time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Looking at our consumer banking business, we continue to see outstanding organic growth. We added 6,220 net
new checking households in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 22,800, a 12% improvement on 2022
year-to-date results. To give a perspective of the power and durability of our organic growth, let me point out that
in the past 36 months, we've added 80,000 net new consumer checking households. This means we grew our
core customer base by 23% in just three years. We believe these are industry-leading numbers and represent
tangible evidence that the customer experience we offer and the reputation we've built set us up to be
successfully competitive.
As we look at these new households, we see that the quality of the growth is also high. A higher percentage of the
accounts are active, the balances are healthy, and the growth is balanced across all the segments we serve.
These factors are evidence that the growth is sustainable and beneficial.
Consumer loan balances outstanding were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, growing 26% year-over-year. In
the third quarter alone, balances increased $181 million or 7% from the second quarter. This robust growth was
driven by our home equity products. In a market where it's becoming increasingly expensive to buy, many families
are deciding to stay and fix up their home, and we've got the right products and services and relationships to help
at this time.
We have a long history of credit quality in the consumer bank, similar to what you're used to hearing about on the
commercial side and the weighted average credit score on the portfolio is 754. Delinquencies are low and stable
at about 80 basis points. Charge-offs are also low and stable at 19 basis points for the year. Also, as we've noted,
we're excited about the prospects for our new mortgage product, which is in its very early stages, but just recently
opened up to all our markets in the state.
Now, looking at our commercial business, I think it's an interesting story. Our new opportunities for the quarter
were strong, but they were down 17% from the second quarter. However, that was because our second quarter
new opportunities were at all-time high after the dislocations brought on by the SVB situation. And as you would
expect, our declines for deals were also high and were almost 2.5 half times our quarterly average.
Now, looking at the third quarter and focusing on our weighted pipeline, that weighted pipeline is up 22% from last
quarter and it's our highest of all time at $1.918 billion. Our previous high was during the second quarter of 2022
at $1.832 billion. The increase comes from all categories, both customers up 18%, and prospects up 25%, both
core, which we define as relationships under $10 million, and large – core up $26%, large up 20%, and both C&I
up 23% and CRE up 24%.
Credit quality continues to be good by historical standards, with classified and non-accrual assets flat and net
charge-offs down quarter-over-quarter. Non-accrual loans totaled $67 million at the end of the third quarter
compared with $68 million at the end of the second quarter, essentially flat for the quarter. The third quarter figure
represents just 37 basis points of total loans and 14 basis points of total assets.
Problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 or higher totaled $513 million at the end of the third quarter.
That's up from $441 million at the end of the second quarter, and $387 million this time last year. Virtually all of
the linked-quarter growth was in the OAEM risk category, or grade 10. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were
$5 million. They were down from $9.8 million in the second quarter. Annualized net charge-offs for the third
quarter represent 11 basis points of average loans and year-to-date, annualized net charge-offs are 18 basis
points of average loans, which is below historic averages.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Regarding commercial real estate, our overall portfolio remains stable, with steady operating performance across
all types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values. Within this portfolio, what we'd consider
to be the major categories of investor CRE that is office, multifamily, retail and industrial, as example, totaled $3.5
billion or 40% of CRE loans outstanding, and are flat quarter-over-quarter. Our investor CRE portfolio has held up
well with the average performance metrics remaining essentially unchanged quarter-over-quarter and exhibiting
an overall loan to value of about 54% loan to cost of about 60% and acceptable reported debt service coverage
ratios.
Higher interest rates continue to be a challenge for our CRE borrowers and have impacted performance of some
project as compared to original [ph] performers (00:13:15). However, on average, we're comfortable with the
quality of the portfolio. As an example, the investor office portfolio, which has been top of mind since the
pandemic, had a balance of $950 million at quarter end and exhibited an average loan to value of 52% and an
average debt-service coverage ratio of 1.46, up slightly from last quarter. 83% of this portfolio is stabilized with
healthy coverage levels, and less than 5% of the portfolio is considered spec with even these few projects being
in strong submarkets with good leasing dynamics and strong, experienced developers.
Our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers
and sponsors and the predominantly Class A nature of our office building projects. And again, we're glad to be
operating in Texas.
So, in closing, we remain optimistic for what lies ahead. We're capitalizing on opportunities, and I'm proud of all
our bankers as they accomplish all of this across all our communities. Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief
Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about – more about our Houston 1.0 expansion
results. As Phil mentioned, we've been very pleased with the volumes we've been able to achieve. Looking at the
third quarter, linked-quarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was 46% for deposits.
That's $170 million growth linked-quarter and on loans, a 52% annualized growth or $133 million quarter-over-
quarter for loans – I'm sorry, the 46% was for deposits. And for the third quarter, Houston 1.0 contributed $0.06 to
our quarterly EPS.
Now moving to our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was 3.4%, down
only 1-basis-point from the 3.45% reported last quarter. Some positives for the quarter included higher yields on
loans and balances at the Fed, combined with higher loan volumes. These positives were primarily offset by
higher cost of deposits and customer repos compared to the second quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the investment portfolio averaged $20.6 billion during the third quarter, down
$721 million from the second quarter. During the quarter we did not make any material investment purchases and
sold about $361 million in municipal securities at a small net gain as we took advantage of market dislocations
which allowed us to improve interest income going forward. The net unrealized loss on the available for sale
portfolio at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of $600 million from the $1.6 billion reported at the
end of the second quarter.
The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the third quarter was 3.24%, flat with the second
quarter. The taxable portfolio which averaged $13.6 billion, down approximately $216 million from the prior
quarter had a yield of 2.76%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax exempt municipal portfolio

averaged about $7 billion during the third quarter, down $505 million from the second quarter and had a taxable
equivalent yield of 4.26%, down 1 basis point from the prior quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, approximately 71% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured.
The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was 5.7 years, up from 5.2 years at the end
of the second quarter, impacted by duration extension in both our municipal and MBS agency portfolios.
Looking at deposits on a linked-quarter basis, average deposits of $40.8 billion were basically flat with the
previous quarter, as they were only down $179 million or 0.4%. We did continue to see a mix shift during the
quarter as non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $408 million or 2.7%, while interest-bearing deposits
increased $229 million or 0.9% when compared to the previous quarter.
Based on third quarter average balances, non-interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were
36.3%, compared to 37.1% in the second quarter. Non-interest-bearing deposits totaled $14.8 billion at the end of
the quarter, with 96% of that amount being commercial demand deposits.
During the individual months of the third quarter, we did see the average balances in the non-interest-bearing
accounts begin to stabilize. During last quarter's call, I noted that July's average balance was down $202 million
from the June average. The full month-to-date average for July was $14.84 billion, down only $173 million from
the June average. Our August average was flat with July, and the September average was down only $60 million
to $14.78 billion.
For October month-to-date through yesterday, the average non-interest-bearing deposit balance is $14.52 billion,
down $259 million from the September average.
Looking at total interest-bearing deposits, they've been relatively stable during the period. Average interest-
bearing deposits were $26.0 billion during the quarter, up $229 million or 0.9% from the second quarter. For
October month-to-date average, the balance in interest-bearing deposits through yesterday was $26.3 billion, up
$102 million from our September average.
We do continue to see a shift in the mix and interest-bearing deposits to higher-cost CDs from lower-cost savings
IOC and MMA. The cost of interest-bearing deposits in the third quarter was 2.12%, up 25 basis points from
1.87% in the second quarter. Customer repos for the third quarter averaged $3.5 billion, down $183 million from
the $3.7 billion averaged in the second quarter. The cost of customer repos for the quarter was 3.67%, up 15
basis points from the second quarter.
Looking at our non-interest income on a linked-quarter basis, I just wanted to point out a couple of items. Trust
and investment management fees were down $1.8 million or 4.5% compared to the second quarter, driven by
decreases in estate fees of $1.1 million, real estate fees of $673,000, and tax fees of $413,000, partly offset by an
increase in investment fees of $750,000. Estate fees and real estate fees can fluctuate based on the number of
estate settled or properties sold respectively, while tax fees, by their nature, are typically higher in the second
quarter.
Other charges, commissions and fees were up $1.0 million or 8.6% compared to the second quarter, impacted by
increases in various accounts, including money market income up $282,000, letter of credit fees up $155,000,
and annuity income up $121,000. Other income was up $3.0 million or 29% when compared to the second
quarter, impacted by higher public finance underwriting fees up $1.6 million and higher combined derivative and
foreign exchange income up $1.8 million.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Looking at our projection of full year 2023 total non-interest expenses, we continue to expect total non-interest
expense for the full year 2023 to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens over our 2022 reported levels.
This does not include the potential impact of the FDIC special assessment, which is not yet been finalized. The
effective tax rate for the first nine months of the year was 16.3%. Our current expectation is that our full-year
effective tax rate for 2023 should approximate 16.5% to 17%. But that can be affected by discrete items during
this fourth quarter.
Regarding the estimates for full year 2023 earnings, our current projections don't include any additional changes
to the Fed funds rate through the rest of the year – through the rest of 2023. Given that rate assumption and our
expectation of 2023 non-interest expense growth of mid-teens, which does not include the impact of the FDIC
special assessment and given our strong performance this quarter, we believe that the current [indiscernible]
(00:21:59) of analyst estimates of $9.22 is too low.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

I want to start, so on the deposit side, Jerry, to follow up where you just left off with the non-interest-bearing that
$14.9 billion – $14.8 billion, it's pretty stable. In fourth quarter, we typically see some window dressing, right, from
companies that it picks up a bit. Can we safely say that we're now at a bottom for the non-interest-bearing
deposits?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Steven, I think that, certainly when I look at it, I feel today versus three months ago, feel a lot more
comfortable with where they're at. Obviously, you've seen and I kind of tried to give that sort of color in my
commentary. We are seeing little downward ticks, but it's really been stable. In my mind, those small $100 million,
$200 million decreases have been relatively stable, as you said, and we've seen historically, the fourth quarter is
the best quarter, right, as companies try to do some window dressing. So, I don't know that I can confidently say
that we're at the bottom, but I certainly feel a whole lot better today than I did a quarter ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then on the loan side, I think I've been able to piece together all the color you gave on consumer
and commercial. But there's no doubt loan growth picked up this quarter. Could you give us – drill down why is it
just these new markets coming online when you look at the growth, and it sounds like you're pretty optimistic, you
think it's sustainable, this improvement you're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, Steven, with all of that, it's still, I think, high-single digits number. And that's kind of what our sustainable
target has been for a while. So I would hope that it is. It would be our goal that it is. We've looked hard at where
it's coming from. Like I said, with that really big spike in the second quarter, we talked about where it came from
and it was, by and large, a lot of good credits. It just didn't meet our structure that what we wanted to do maybe.
Maybe we were full in a category and didn't want to reach out in one particular area.
And I think – in just talking to our people, a lot of banks, they just put their pencils down. And we have liquidity.
People know that we're not always the place where people like to go to get a little structure on a deal, but we're
consistent, through the good times and bad times. I think people realize that and I think that we got a lot of phone
calls and a lot of opportunities to do stuff. And I mentioned how many we declined because I didn't want people
thinking that, oh, well, look, Cullen/Frost got some loan growth. They must be just taken other people's problems.
That's not what's happening. And we're just seeing a lot of good opportunity.
I think part of it is, well, it's a lot of things. It's our reputation for strength and stability in times like these. But yeah,
our people are great at sales and calling and developing relationships. They're held accountable to it. They've
been doing a good job. When you have a balance sheet like ours, it puts you in a good place to take advantage of
opportunities. And I think that's what we've been seeing. It's hard to pin down on any one particular thing because
I think it's been pretty consistent.
I might speak a little bit more about it because I just had a recent conversation about the expansion growth, right?
I gave you – try to give you some feel for – it's pretty granular in terms of what's coming on. But I had a
conversation – but what kind of deals are we seeing? And a lot of it is its owner – it's owner businesses, right?
They have a business – a business to consumer model. They're not really sexy businesses but – in a sense, but
they're just good, stable, long-term businesses that are a result of hiring community bankers in these communities
we've gone in. And it's – so it is very diverse.
The commercial real estate that we see there, is mainly because someone wants to not pay rent anymore. They
want to own their own building for their business. That's slowed down some because rates are so high, but that's

still going to be the arc, I think, of the kind of business we're doing. And when I hear that, it makes me feel really
good about just how our core and how stable it is because that's really our wheelhouse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Phil, so if I could ask one final one. So, as we're probably, I don't know, two-thirds through earnings
season, what we're hearing from the industry, particularly the larger regionals, because most of them are on this
RWA, [indiscernible] (00:27:39) right? They're just shrinking assets. They're almost all tightening on expenses,
right? A lot of them are guiding to flattish expenses for 2024.
And to be quite frank, I don't know how to think about Cullen/Frost for 2024, and I'm not looking for like a number,
but I want to know how you're thinking about it, because in many ways, this is going to be a great market for you
to take bankers, right? I mean, as everybody is sort of on the sidelines, which you mentioned. So, I don't know, I
think number is 14% year-over-year. Are you thinking about, hey, this is a year that we're going to continue to
expand and maybe expense growth stays at that rate, or are you share some of your other CEOs like, no, we
need to tighten also just because the environment's a little more challenging. How do you think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, what we're thinking is that we've got a great opportunity to expand and we have plans in place. We're
doubling – we started the process of doubling Austin, in the middle of tripling Dallas. We think these are great
opportunities and we are getting good applicant flow, let me put it that way in these markets.
So it's not like we're going, oh, we need to hire more bankers because we've got an opportunity for this or that. I
mean, we're hiring tons of bankers as a part of this expansion and there's plenty of work to go around there. So,
we are hiring, but it's a part of our strategy we've put in place already. We're having good success there. We are
not backing off and saying, oh, look, we need to cut expenses now because I don't know, because for whatever.
We're winning competitively, I'll just say, and now's the time for us to keep moving forward.
Now, did Jerry and I talk with folks about what they're spending and what the trend is? We want it to be lower next
year just because there's a limit to what you can do over time. And we want to be prudent about all this stuff. No,
we are not in a retrenchment mode at all. Jerry, you want to talk something about expenses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I mean, I think Phil said it. And we've been very focused, as you said. And, Steven, you know us, our focus on
expenses continues. Certainly when you look at the percentage, you might – someone may roll their eyes. But
obviously, we talked about the things that we're doing to grow the business, grow our product selection and
expand our marketing. I actually think those have all been – it improved our technology. Those have all been
smart things that we're doing.
And as we said, our guidance for our team has really been that we are – we've kind of given guidance to this mid-
teen sort of growth this year, but certainly would expect that when we talk in January, that that's not the sort of
growth we'll be giving from a target standpoint.

On your outlook for higher EPS versus consensus, are you guys assuming you've reached a bottom now in NIM
and NII, given your rate outlook? You've been pretty stable here for a couple of quarters now. Are you thinking
that trend continues and then when do you think you could get back to NII growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think that – and I think I've been pretty consistent. The fourth quarter for us I think is going to be a little bit
weaker. I don't think it's – and it's not significant. The guidance I gave last quarter was I thought they'd be flattish
and I could even still say that with a downward bias. I mean, we were down 1 basis point between these quarters.
So, I'm kind of feeling that same pressure.
I think that as I look out into 2024 and we'll give more color in January, as I said, but I think we've talked a couple
of times that we have some opportunities with some reinvestment of some proceeds that are going to be coming
to us pretty early in 2024 from maturities in our investment portfolio. And even though we haven't really decided
what sort of an investment plan we'll put in place, just putting it on our – in balances at the Fed would be a
significant improvement.
I think we've made no secret of the fact that we bought $1 billion in Treasury securities that mature. I think the first
tranche, say first $250 million is on December 31st. So I really say basically they're all in early 2024 and it's at a
1%.
So, that's sort of a pickup that we're kind of projecting for most of 2024 as those securities get to be reinvested
and a lot of it will be dependent of what our assumptions are for lower rates if that's the case in 2024, when we

get to that forecasting period in January. But, right now, I do think that we – the same guidance I gave last quarter
about kind of flattish to a little bit downward bias is kind of where I'm at for this fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Appreciate that. And then going back to the stats you were talking about on the non-interest-bearing, it
sounded like October was down, if I heard this right, maybe $260 million-ish from the September average. I know
that will bounce around. Was just wondering if you had isolated what drove that tick up in the run-off here this
month?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. To be honest with you, there's so many accounts in there and there's a lot of positives and negatives and a lot
of volatility that goes in with those accounts. And to be honest with you, from my end, when I see a movement like
that in a month, I tend to think it's pretty flattish. And we hope certainly that we've seen the drop to bottom, as we
said. Phil talked about the new relationships that we're adding. On the commercial side, it typically takes us a few
months from three months to six months to get those commercial deposits on. So we continue to be pretty
optimistic about it and hope the worst is behind us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And maybe one last one just on expenses. You mentioned the mid-teens growth guide, and that implies a
little bit of a wider range, I guess, since we only have one quarter left. And it seems like a midpoint would imply a
little bit of a step up in expense growth in 4Q. Are you thinking maybe more at the bottom end of that range at this
point since you came in a little bit lower this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I was joking a little bit earlier of what does mid-teens mean, right? In my mind, that's one number. And it
could be a different number in your case. I will say, David, that my expectation today versus where we were a
quarter ago is that we'll be lower. We had a really – we beat for the quarter and some of it was on the expense
side coming in lower than we had expected. And we do a lot of settlements on incentives and kind of look and see
where all those incentive plans come in. Some of our incentive payments all vest and – are issued and vest in the
fourth quarter. So there's a little bit uncertainty there.
But if you're looking at where I was a quarter ago versus where I am today, yeah, I certainly feel like it will be a
little bit lighter than I thought we would be.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. So, Phil, you talked about growth maybe somewhat slowing as we look into next year. But just give us a
sense of how customers are holding up when we think about this lagged effect of the Fed rate hikes, maybe
consumer demand slowing down a bit. I'm not sure whether or not that's happening in your markets, but give us a
sense of just the resiliency of the customer base, where if any place where you're seeing softness from a credit
quality perspective. And it may not be within Frost's loan book, but just in the market where you're seeing some
softness.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Ebrahim, I think the – you know, they're pretty well known, right? It's deals that were underwritten that, have seen
them on a floating basis, that have seen the higher rates and operating cost are up. There are – honestly, I mean,
I don't pay a lot of attention to other banks, but I mean, I know our credit is – credit numbers are really strong. I
don't get the sense we've had a tremendous problem here in the state and we said we're glad we're operating in
Texas. We really are. I think it makes a huge difference.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
I don't see things – you mentioned I said it was slower next year. I don't remember that. I don't feel like it's going
to be that much slower. I talked to customers. It's kind of funny when you go out and talk to them. I was with a
construction guy and he looked at me, said, I'm really interested in how you see the economy. And I said, well, I
was embarrassed saying it. I said, I don't think it's that bad. And he looked at me, said, that's how I'd think, too.
And we almost felt embarrassed for each other that we said if we feel like we're going to get canceled or
something because, there's – I guess if you watch too much TV, you think it's supposed to be bad.
But I think it's more worry about than there is actual problems today. And I'm not trying to be Pollyanna. It's just,
most people when you talk about their business – there's some problems here or there, we got – talked about
some increase in our risk grade 10s. I mean, yes, there are some issues, but it's not bad.
If I had to pick, let's say, okay, let me see. So, I would say probably, you know, you buy here, pay here, used car.
It's got some pressure because they're rate sensitive business. And so that's probably some issues. I mean if
you've got an office building that's refi-ing now and you don't have the capacity or the willingness to right size it,
there could be some issues there. And then there's just the one-off thing that's just business that we see.
We've seen some things and – let's say, contractors. There was a big electrical contractor, but they had
government work, which is always a little bit dicey from our experience. But they're working hard to right that shift.
But you know, if you didn't bid the right way and cost went up, you got a fixed rate deal, fixed cost deal, that could
be some issues. So, those are the kind of things we're seeing, but like we said on our prepared comments, it's –
you're holding in there and – and look, I'll say, let's take multifamily.
They were underwritten 2 years ago, 2.5 years ago. It's in construction, they're going to have to – if rates don't go
down, they have to right size some of the stuff, but they know that and we've been talking to them about that. And
it matters who you're doing business with and who your sponsors are. And so it's not something that we're really
worried about and – at this point. And I think most of that stuff matures or has to be dealt with in 2025 and 2026.
There's very little of it. I think 17% in 2024. Yeah.
And I'll give you one other thing that – because maybe think I'm whistling past the graveyard, there was a
multifamily deal [indiscernible] (00:40:11) a customer, it was right at one times coverage. Okay? And that thing
sold at a 4.5% cap and a gain to the borrower. So, just because – I mean, [indiscernible] (00:40:32) there's still a
lot of demand for that out there. And so even though you might not be making a debt-service coverage ratio
somewhere, that if you're in the right asset class, there's still some demand for what you've got.
So, I know I didn't answer that very specifically, but I think things are still hanging in there pretty well right now.
And the final thing I'll say is, as it relates to the consumer, they still got a job. You know, they've – in Texas, the
unemployment numbers look pretty good and as long as they've got a job, even though maybe spending down
their savings are able to hang in there, spend money.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think some of it's going to be dependent. We're having some conversations early this week, especially
when you talk about a market like Austin where we've got a – the permitting process is different. We're different –
we're having to deal with different municipal parties and such. So that can kind of affect certainly the number that
we're talking about. But I think the last number I saw combined in 2024 was around 15, I think, across all three
markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A

Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to check in on deposit data as you spoke about seeing a mix shift from lower cost
to higher cost deposits again this quarter. Can you help us think through peak deposit betas in 2024 as rates stay
higher for longer, just given – and also give some color on the competition that you're seeing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So right now for – I guess I'll talk a little bit about 2023. So, for the third quarter, I think cumulatively on this
cycle, we're up 2%. We were at – on interest-bearing, we were at 37% in the second quarter. We're at 39% at the
end of the third quarter. I'd expect that same sort of a little clip between the third and the fourth quarter on
interest-bearing. And same sort of movement on total deposits. I think we increased from 23% to 25% through the
end of the third quarter.

Right now from a competitive standpoint, we're really – we try to keep an eye and we do keep an eye on our
competitors really at all levels. We don't feel like we need to be the top, but we do want to be competitive and we
look at rates weekly. What we've seen more competitive pressure today in the last couple of recent weeks has
been more on the CDE side. I think that's really what large consumers and commercial customers are looking for,
is kind of what the CD rates are, to keep it at the bank.
And so that's where we're seeing most of the pressure. And we tend to price – we keep an eye on what the
comparable Treasury security is doing to determine our pricing there. So I think we're really pretty competitive and
feel good about where we're at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe a follow-up on expenses. I know you noted the expense growth rate would likely come down
next year. But at the start of this year, when you guided to the mid-teens expense growth, I think you had
mentioned, you'd be investing in some IT and cyber projects, upgrading a couple of core systems. And I think you
also noted that the timing of several large projects were just coinciding in 2023. So, should we think about some
of these one-time costs coming out next year or are these multiyear investments that you're making in the
business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think most of the things that we're talking about are multiyear investments. Most of these are going to be
either positions that we hired from new IT staff or projects that will get capitalized. I think what we've seen is that
some of this has moved into later parts of 2023 a little bit. And so feeling a little bit of – some of the upside that we
probably are seeing when we talked about earning expense guidance being a little bit lighter than where we
originally thought, had a little bit to do with some of that timing.
So, we're not really – I'm not thinking anything that comes to mind immediately, a one-time sort of expenses that
were driving that expense growth this year. It was more that more people and capitalized projects. And like I said,
we have a little bit that's moving into next year. But as Phil said, we don't expect certainly that that our expense
growth for next year will be in the double digits that the mid-teens that I've been discussing for this year. Does that
help?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
It doesn't sound like there's a large chunk of investments that are getting delayed and moving from this year to
next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think that'll be a good conclusion.

Hey, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe just to ask the expense question a little differently. As I look over the last, I don't know, three or four years,
you made a big investment in Houston, a big investment in Dallas. Now a big investment in Austin. I know that
was a big piece of the abnormally high expense growth. As you think about it going forward, are there still markets
out there where you want to make a substantial new investment, or do you think with these three – I mean, you're
kind of in the three big spots there in Texas. With these three, are you kind of done making these large
investments in a new market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, I mean, look, we've got – we got a lot of – first of all, we have a lot work left to do. Okay. So we got to finish
up Dallas. We were just starting Austin. And we've got a pretty big network that we're going to continue to deal
with and continue to grow in the normal course of business, right? But I don't want to be too far out in front of that.
But look, we're going to be – like I said earlier, we're going to be doing this for a long time. I mean, there are great
markets to be in, in the state. They're great markets to be in out of this state. I'm looking way down the road.
I mean, I'm just saying, I don't think there's anything about our business model that ends when we get through
doing 17 branches in Austin. And so maybe to answer your question another way, the way to think about our
company is probably that we've got this legacy part of our company that operates very efficiently and very
profitably and it's got a lot of control in terms of expenses, that kind of thing. And then we have this expansion
element of our company that is a growth and expansion component and that has higher growth rates just – it's the
nature of that kind of business and what we believe is the combination of those two. And they do two different
things, right?
There's a legacy kind of piece and there's this new expansion piece. Maybe we'll probably always be as long as
we're doing a little bit higher on average than others. But another way to think of it, too, is a lot of these expansion
assets are going to be creating the money and the revenue to fund future expansions, too. So that's not a very
specific answer, but it's sort of how we think about the business right now.

Yeah. That helps. And then we've seen some of your peers do a partial bond restructuring. I know your bond yield
was around 3.25. So if you mark to market that bond yield, you'll probably be picking up at least a couple of
hundred basis points. How do you all think about restructuring a piece of the bond book? And your TCE is in the
mid 4% range. Like, does that matter? I know common equity Tier 1 is a lot higher. But does the TCE matter
when you consider a possible bond restructuring?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, I'll say that we have not discussed any sort of a bond restructuring. I think that we've got – obviously we've
got the securities and available for sale. We think it gives us the most amount of flexibility. We like the
transparency that it provides through equity. And I think from a tangible capital standpoint, we don't spend a lot of
time thinking about it. We're obviously aware of it.
As we said earlier, we haven't made any investment purchases this year. I think if we do put a program in place,
we'll certainly – whatever program we put in place, we will certainly consider the potential implications of the new
capital regime that's out there for banks that are $100 billion, that would have to include OCI. So, we're not – it's
nothing that we're not aware of. It's more that at this point, it's not been really something that that's been part of
our conversation.
So, anyway, anything else I would say I'd kind of make it up, but it's not something that we've really talked about
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally, for me, it looks like – it looks like the share count went down just modestly in the third
quarter relative to the second quarter. So, maybe a modest amount of share buybacks. Your stock was at a year
to date low. I know it's up pretty nicely today, but it's still relatively cheap versus where you all have been trading
earlier this year. How do you think about a share buyback with the stock at this level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think we spent – we didn't spend a lot of money, but we got in earlier than I would have liked in retrospect.
I think I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I think it was around $11 million that we spent in the
quarter. I mean, it's just something that we'll talk about. There is, on one side, we're having the conversation, like
you said, about, how much are people paying attention to tangible capital, and on the other side, I'm talking about
what a great bargain our stock is even before today – before today, especially.
So it's just a conversation we'll continue to have. It won't have big implications. I think at this point, we're probably
we've got a $100-million program that expires in January. We've probably utilized $30 million of it, if I remember
correctly. So, it won't have huge impacts, but it's something that we consider continue to discuss. But again, it's
not going to have a big impact.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Phil, I noticed your comments about optimism around home
equity. And just looking at the average balances, we don't have them for this quarter to [indiscernible] (00:53:16)
that out, but just over the past quarter, couple of quarters, it seems like that's over half the average loan growth.
Just wanted to kind of size the opportunity as we move forward and particularly as you roll out the mortgage
product. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

numbers, but what were you asking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Oh, I see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
...going forward. And then as you layer in mortgage, consumer mortgage, I know the market's not great, but
you're in Texas, just trying to get a sense for what the growth opportunity is. And I think that home equity
consumer line is about 12.5% of the portfolio. Just where do you think that could get to over time? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, well, the mortgage portfolio has – is a great asset class for us. I think over time, this is back a year ago
when we started talking about it, I think we said, I can't remember exactly what we said, but the impression we
wanted to give you was that, hey, this could be – mortgage itself over time could be what the consumer real
estate portfolio was at that time, just by itself. And so, that's – we still think it's good. This is a long-term product,
long-term relationships. So we feel good about it.
And remember, we're not doing a refi program. So I don't care that the refi markets down. In fact I love it because
it's allowed us to get, I don't know, what, 90 people or so that we were able to bring in great mortgage
professionals to build that infrastructure over the last year. So, we're all about putting people in homes and that's,
I think, we're going to have a chance to do that for a long time.
I think that, I saw a number, Michael, the percentage of people that had a, what was it, a 3% mortgage, was like
over 60%, is amazing. And if you looked at the people that had under, [ph] (00:55:28) was it 5%, it's like 90-
something percent of the mortgages. So, if you want a – I mean, people are not moving, right? And so I think that
this home equity product has got legs, it's home improvement products, it's got legs for a while. The rate of growth
has been so high, what, 20s mid-20 sometimes, that I think that just by its nature, the law of numbers, it has to go
down in terms of percentage.

But I still think the volume should be pretty good because it just fills a gap that people need right now.

Great. I appreciate the color. And just one final for me. So the – I guess the potential problem loans were up
about 16% Q-on-Q. Any notable trends in there, anything to read in that? Or it's just more kind of normalization of
credit off of a very low base? Thanks.

The numbers I've looked at were the – I think where I saw the change was in the risk grade 10s. Really, there
were about – I think there were four credits that made up the vast majority of that and they were like different
businesses. There are a couple of real estate properties. They were – actually they were smaller office buildings.
They had kind of idiosyncratic things and we don't feel that bad about them. But we felt they – remember, this is
OAEM. This is a lighter classification, but – and then there was something a midstream energy trading company,
that it's just a business kind of thing, I mean [indiscernible] (00:57:15) I think and then we got – what was the other
one? Oh, I think it was a – I think it was a five-year, eight-year outfit. I think that's what that was.
And so it kind of an interest sensitive business. We've seen some of that. That was the kind of thing. It didn't give
me lot of heartburn. It's just reflective of the environment we're in. But I didn't think it said anything in particular
about how are we doing. We're doing things, in fact, I think it shows that we were doing our business pretty well
and, again, I've said since the beginning of this that it's a risk business and will we see some hiccups here or
there? Of course, we will. But I feel really good about how we've done things. I feel really good about the
customers. Not every one of them has performed like we want, but most of them have. I feel pretty comfortable
with it.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I was just wondering, I wanted to follow-up on office. I was wondering if you happen to have what the reserve
against the office portfolio is and how you think about that moving forward just given some of the larger banks are
putting up pretty hefty reserves against their office portfolios?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Let's see what we have here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I'm looking at what I've got. I've only got the commercial real estate as a group. What I'm looking at, Brody,
I don't have the office. But certainly I think that number, if I'm looking at this correctly here, is 1.45 on all
commercial real estate and certainly if you get with A.B., we could certainly provide you that detail. I don't think
I've got it here in front of me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. I'll follow up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I will say – I'm not going to do anything just because the large banks are doing something. Just so you know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. I did also, Jerry, I'm sorry to go back to expenses and...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Hey, Brody, so I'm getting a chat real quick. It's saying that our reserve is 2.2% on office.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thank you very much for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I did just want to touch on expenses.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
The – a couple of quarters ago, you said you thought that the long-term kind of expense growth rate for the bank
is high-single-digit. I just want to ask, like, would it be fair to say that Austin – the Austin build-out will be mildly
additive to that kind of long-term growth rate when you think about planning for next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that the way we tend to look at it is – and again, it's going to be dependent on how big an expansion we
really typically would originate. But when I gave that sort of guidance that was inclusive, would be inclusive of
what we were doing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then the last one that I had was, I'm sorry if you said it earlier and I missed it. Do
you happen to have, for the fixed rate portion of loan portfolio, what's coming due over the next 12 months and
what the yield pickup on that would be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I don't think I've got that handy with me, Brody. But again, I think that's something certainly A.B. can get it to
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe if I could just ask one more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Of course.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Do you happen to have what the percent of the portfolio that SNCs is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's 4%. Let me double check that, but that's my recollection. Hold on just a second. Yeah, at the end
of – at the end of September, that portfolio was – the SNC portfolio was $789 million or 4.3% of the period-end
loans.
