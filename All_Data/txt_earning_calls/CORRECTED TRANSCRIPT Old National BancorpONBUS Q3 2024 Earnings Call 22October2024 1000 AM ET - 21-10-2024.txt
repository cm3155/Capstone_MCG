Good morning. Earlier today, Old National reported our third quarter 2024 results with earnings per share in line
with expectations. These solid third quarter results were driven by our ability to execute on our organic growth
strategy and invest in new markets and talent in our footprint. Our results were also driven by the strong organic
deposit growth, prudent loan growth, durable margin management, and focused efforts in growing our fee income

businesses. Moving to our third quarter highlights on slide 4, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.44 per common
share and our adjusted EPS was $0.46. Our adjusted ROATCE for the quarter was 16.8% and our adjusted ROA
was 1.13%. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 51.2%. Our core deposit growth was strong at 10.1%
annualized, with our non-interest-bearing deposits growing nearly $100 million during the quarter.
Our total cost of deposits for the quarter remains at a low 225 basis points, and we were already taking advantage
of recent Fed actions, which John will touch on later in his comments. Meanwhile, our commercial loans were up
4.1% annualized due to disciplined client selection. Growing our tangible common book value per share remains
a top priority, rising 8% since the second quarter of 2024 and 21% year-over-year. In summary, our third quarter
2024 earnings evidenced, another strong quarter for Old National. We remain focused on the fundamentals,
continue to fund loan growth with low-cost core deposits, effectively managing credit, creating positive operating
leverage through disciplined expense management and consistently growing tangible book value per share.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Moran.

Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 5, you can see our third quarter balance sheet, which highlights continued
improvement in our liquidity and our capital position. Total deposit growth over the last year has again allowed us
to organically fund loan growth while reducing our borrowings. As Jim just mentioned, we grew our tangible book
value per share by 21% over the last year and by 8% from the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with a strong
CET1 ratio of 11% and we continue to expect that we will accrete capital at a faster pace than most. Our liquidity
and capital levels continue to provide a strong foundation which positions us well as we finish 2024. On slide 6,
we show our earning asset trends. Total loans grew 2.7% annualized from last quarter, in line with industry
performance with strong production in our commercial book in the quarter, partly offset by payoffs.
We remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet our risk adjusted return requirements.
Quarterly new loan production rates in the mid-7% range and marginal funding costs in the low 4% range support
our expectation that net interest income will grow modestly in 4Q 2024. The investment portfolio increased 3% in
the quarter due to reinvestment of cash flows and positive changes in fair values, with duration decreasing to just
under four years. We have approximately $2 billion in cash flows expected over the next 12 months. New money
yields are currently running approximately 110 basis points above back book yields on securities and
approximately 175 basis points above back book yields on fixed rate loans. Moving to slide 7, we show our trend
in total deposits, which grew 8.5% annualized from 2Q.
Core deposits ex-brokered were up an even better 10% annualized and we saw a nearly $100 million increase in
non-interest-bearing deposits in the quarter. Commercial and community deposits were up and public funds saw
normal seasonal increases. Our brokered deposits decreased and at 4.2% as a percentage of total deposits. Our
use of brokered remains well below peer levels. We did see a 9 basis point increase in deposit rates compared to
the prior quarter as we remained on offense with respect to client acquisition and we drove our loan-to-deposit
ratio below 90%. Total deposit cost decreased in September consistent with Fed actions and our spot rate at
September 30 was 212 basis points. Moreover, our exception priced book has seen a 90% down beta since we
started lowering rates in that book in early 2Q. This was in line with our expectations.
Overall, we are highly confident in the execution of our deposit strategy, and it continues to unfold as we
expected. We are prepared to proactively respond to future Fed rate actions and the evolving environment while
staying focused on driving above peer deposit growth at reasonable costs. Slide 8 provides our quarter end
Income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common shares of $140 million or $0.44 per
3

share. Reported earnings include $0.02 per share of merger-related and separation expenses. Excluding these
items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.46. Moving on to slide 9, we present details of our net interest
income and margin. Net interest income grew as expected, while net interest margin was essentially unchanged
as increases in asset yields and accretion were offset by deposit costs.
Year-over-year, we again showed deposit growth that essentially kept pace with asset generation while
maintaining a low total cost of funding. Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted non-interest income which was $94
million for the quarter and above our expectations. Our primary fee businesses all performed well with bank fees
ahead of expectations, mortgage benefiting from seasonality and a modest improvement in production, and
capital markets benefiting from CRE production. Continuing to slide 11, we show the trend in adjusted non-
interest expenses of $263 million for the quarter. Expenses remain well-controlled and we generated positive
linked-quarter operating leverage. On slide 12, we present our credit trends which reflect the quality of both our
commercial and consumer portfolios. Total net charge-offs were 19 basis points and a low 16 basis points
excluding 3 basis points related to PCD loans.
The non-performing loan ratio increased 8 basis points due mostly to four borrowers in unrelated sectors that we
are actively monitoring. The third quarter allowance for credit losses to total loans including the reserve for
unfunded commitments, was 112 basis points, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Risk rating migration over
the last several quarters has been driven by the effects of higher interest rates and a more conservative posture
in our risk rating framework. While the grade migration has resulted in an increase in our quantitative reserves,
our total qualitative reserves are unchanged from the prior quarter. Qualitative reserves now incorporate a 100%
weighting on the Moody's S-2 scenario, with additional qualitative factors to capture the possibility of further grade
migration. This is logical as greater conviction comes into focus that a hard landing scenario is unlikely.
Moreover, the S-2 scenario assumes an unemployment rate that is 70% higher than current levels and negative
GDP. Also, we remind you that our allowance for credit losses plus the discount remaining on acquired loans to
total loans now stands at nearly 160 basis points. Slide 13 presents key credit metrics relative to peers. As you
can see, our proactive approach to credit monitoring has led to above peer levels of NPLs but delinquency and
charge-off ratios that are well below peer averages over time. We have long practiced conservatism and we
continue to believe that the results speak for themselves. On slide 14, we review our capital position at the end of
the quarter. All ratios increased driven by strong retained earnings. In addition, the rate environment further aided
TCE build.
Slide 15 includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance. NII is expected to
increase modestly in the fourth quarter. Our assumptions are listed on the slide, but I would highlight a few of the
primary drivers. First, we assume two rate cuts of 25 basis points each, consistent with the forward curve.
Second, we are now anticipating a declining rate total deposit beta of approximately 30% and a non-interest-
bearing to total deposit mix that remains stable at 24%. We continue to believe that we have positioned the
balance sheet well and we have maintained our neutral rate risk position. Slide 16 includes our outlook for the
fourth quarter and the full year of 2024. You can see the details in the chart, but it is worth pointing out that our full
year outlook for pre-provision net revenue remains unchanged from the initial expectations we shared with you in
January of this year, and our outlook proved more durable than many peers.
Full year loan growth and NII are expected to be right in line with those original expectations, while higher fee
income is expected to be partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. Net charge-offs are in line with our
original range, while provision expenses slightly higher than originally expected as a result of grade migration
driven by our proactive approach to credit management. In summary, year-to-date 2024 results have been
excellent, with third quarter results in line with our expectations and strong performance metrics. More

importantly, we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic priorities. First, we are driving
organic deposit growth to fund our asset generation. Second, our adjusted return profile remains top quartile
against peers at 17% on tangible common equity. Third, we remain disciplined on expenses, driving positive
operating leverage and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 51%.
Fourth, our borrowers remain resilient as evidenced by non-PCD net charge-offs of just 16 basis points. And we
believe we have ample reserve coverage along with a well-diversified and granular loan book. And fifth, we are
continuing to rapidly compound tangible book value per share which was up 21% year-over-year.
With those comments, we'd like to open the call for your questions.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I'd just like to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Scott. Good to hear from you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, likewise. You, too. Thank you. So I just wanted to one – John, appreciate the comments on sort of the full
year NII. I guess the fourth quarter in particular, the expectation maybe a little lighter than what we had hoped 90
days ago, the fact that it's sort of just a function of what happened with the belly of the curve since then as well as
the different timing of the Fed moves. But would love to hear, in your words, any anything that has changed. And
then I know you touched on like the $2 billion of cash flows over the next 12 months. If you could maybe offer any
updated thoughts on sort of how powerfully the NII base could advance from the fourth quarter expectation? And
just sort of main levers additionally that you would see allowing it to do so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Perfect. Yeah. Hey, Scott, your suspicion is right on on the NII guide. Really, it's a touch on the five-year point of
the curve, belly of the curve being a little bit lower is driving that outlook. And then on securities, roughly $2 billion
in cash flow coming off of that book over the next 12 months. Pick up there about 110 basis points against the
back book, so certainly that'll be helpful. And we would anticipate plowing most of that just right back into the
securities book at the margin, there could be a touch if loan growth comes in stronger, maybe we let that come in
just a little bit. But I think most of that will go back into securities at this point.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Okay, perfect. And then maybe if you – John, if you could expand a little on some of the reserving comments, just
in particular, trying to get my arms around why credit costs are a little higher this quarter and expected to be so at
least relative to what I would have anticipated next quarter? Is this something that will continue for a little while or
is it kind of a transitory catch up? How should we think about those sort of dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think, it's just normalization of credit here. I think for the year, we sort of tightened the range on the
guidance. But it's still, I think at the beginning of the year we were saying 15 to 20 basis points on charge-offs,
we're now sitting at 17 basis points to 20 basis points on charge-offs. So I don't think that there's any real
difference in our expectation around loss content. And the provision that you saw in the quarter was kind of
covering charge-offs and building a little bit of reserve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you guys very much.

Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Maybe just to start off here looking a little further out on kind of the margin and NII dynamics. I heard your
comments again this quarter on a relatively rate neutral balance sheet positioning. Maybe just offer some
thoughts on how you expect the NIM to traject across 2025 if we end up getting the forward curves like let's say
200 basis points or so of cuts by the end of next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Brendan, I think – I think what you're seeing here is kind of bottoming in 3Q, 4Q, probably up a little bit –
but our bias would be up a little bit. I think our bias in 3Q was kind of stable to down a little bit and that played out,
right. I think as we look out into 2025, de-inverting in the yield curve and continued growth in the underlying
franchise are going to be helpful for us. And, look, I think that's helpful for us, it's helpful for the whole industry,
right. So, I think, that'll be the key factor next year.

Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, perfect. Perfect. Maybe one more from me. Just kind of looking at the charge-off rate on the ex-PCD kind of
core loan book, seeing a little bit higher numbers over the past two quarters. Just wondering how you would
characterize that? Is that still well within the framework of normalization off of a low base or is it indicative of
perhaps some gradual weakening?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
No, I think you hit the nail on the head with your first option, Brendan, which is it's normalization of credit, we're
still well within our guidance. As John said, we started the year at 15 basis points to 20 basis points, we're now 17
basis points to 20 basis points for the full year. And so as credit normalizes, I think that's just what you're seeing.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Hey, Ben. It's Mark. I would answer it in this way. I think we're open and opportunistic, but we don't need to do
anything really. We like the team that we have. We think we can outgrow industry loan growth. I think our deposit
performance – growth performance has been terrific and all of our teams are focused on that. So I don't think we
need to do anything, but we will continue to look to opportunistically fill in good talent. We say it all the time, it
pays for itself quickly. And so if people come along, but we're also watching expenses closely. And so we're not
looking to add talent unless just that great opportunity comes along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, I might add on top of that. As we think about talent acquisition, we're particularly paying attention to our fee
income businesses. If you think about Treasury management, you think about our wealth management
businesses, those are businesses that again have a little bit longer earn back on the hires, but we think are the
right long-term investments for us, particularly as we just transition to sort of larger institution, have more
opportunities in that space. And so that's an area, as Mark says, we have plenty of balance sheet growth and
don't feel like we need to have more relationship managers there to grow the balance sheet. However, on those
fee income businesses there will be continued opportunities for us to be successful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. And then when you think about the integration and going forward, kind of let's call it the
Southeast, kind of is there any additional cost savings now that you kind of have the integration in place, you kind
of have your lay of the land? Anything that you would want to potentially call as incremental, more positive on
growth or thoughts on additional expense cuts just now that you have your feet [indiscernible] (00:18:42) here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. No. I think you'll see the full run rate reflected in 4Q in terms of the saves that we highlighted for CapStar, just
to remind you those are around $30 million annually, and we expect that that'll be fully realized in the fourth
quarter. I think if anything, we're looking to invest in that market. It's a great market, and I don't know if Mark
would add or Jim would add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I would just add that we spent a lot of time down there. Seems like I'm down there a few times a month and
it's unique. In our core legacy Midwestern markets, oftentimes we're part of the economic engines that are making
those communities successful. And down in Nashville and Tennessee broadly, really, you just have to be there.
There's just plenty of organic growth opportunities for us, and we need to be in a position to take advantage of
that. And so, as John said, I think we'll continue to invest there. It's unlike any other part of our franchise where
the economic growth is still incredibly strong.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, John, let's start with a question for you. Does the $400 million guide for
NII in the fourth quarter, does that assume $13 million of accretion? And then, how are you thinking about the
deposit beta over the next several quarters? I know on the slide, you said 30% total deposit beta by the end of
this year. But what's your insight beyond the end of 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, the accretion piece, yeah, roughly stable, so you got the right number there for 4Q. In terms of beta, I
think 30% probably allows us still some room to play offense, and we've been unapologetic about that. We're on
our front foot with respect to client acquisition and we really want to continue to fund organically our loan growth. I
think where we'll get the most beta, and we've been saying this for a couple quarters now and it's playing out
exactly as we had expected is really in that exception price book. And there, we expect to see roughly [ph] 85%
down (00:20:52) beta, and we've been able to move that very quickly. In fact, when the when the Fed moved 50
basis points, [ph] Mike Lloyd (00:20:59) and team had Program A and Program B. One was ready to go for 25
basis points, one was ready to go for 50 basis points.
When we got 50 basis points, they pressed the button and that went in that afternoon, right? And so, we're ready
to move very, very quickly and we'll remain agile.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow-up, could you discuss any common themes among the increase in non-accrual
loans? I think there was four specific borrowers as well as the increase in classified loans. And anything to do with
the recent Shared National Credit exam that showed up in third quarter results?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, I'll take those in reverse, Terry. It's Mark. Given the environment, we moved to a more conservative posture
in our risk rating framework this year which drove that negative migration overall. We're now looking at our
primary source of repayment, debt service coverage, almost exclusively in our risk ratings. And so, as borrowers
have absorbed a full year of the 500-basis point increase in rates, coverage ratios have tightened, particularly in
CRE. We still feel good about secondary sources of repayment, guarantors and collateral. So – but these sources
no longer factor into our risk ratings. But they obviously influence loss content which we still believe is generally
low across our special mention and substandard loans. Specifically to the non-accruals, there were four larger
credits. When I say larger, you got to think about that, relatively speaking, larger for us.
Now, those four credits were all in the $12 million to $25 million range, so each one is a manageable level. Each
was on our radar screen before they moved into non-accrual. And again, that's just reflective of our granular
portfolio, I think. One was a downgrade from the SNC exam, a C&I credit out of the CapStar portfolio. The other
three were different segments of CRE, so no trend, no geography, just unique issues to each individual credit.
And again, I'll just say, like most of our non-performing book, I think there's decent underlying value in the real
9

estate and demand for those properties. So, even though our non-accruals are up, our charge-off guidance hasn't
moved. We think in Q4 we'll still be in that 20 to 25 basis points.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Barclays. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe just looking at the guide for fee income, it sort of looks like it's implying an $8
million decline versus third quarter. Anything specifically driving that or is that just a little bit of seasonality? And
how should we be thinking about sort of the jumping off point as we look next year on fee income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Jared. Yeah, it was, I think a little bit seasonality in some of the lines that are subject to that right,
mortgage will probably be a little bit softer in the fourth quarter. Capital markets had a really strong 3Q. I don't
know that I would – that I would necessarily count on that one run rating. And then in other there was a couple of
little things that kind of broke our way in 3Q that I don't know are necessarily run ratable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then how should we be thinking about your thoughts and view on capital build here? It
certainly seems like we're going to continue to see capital building, especially CET1, plenty of capital for the
organic growth side. Is there an opportunity to supplement that with buybacks or any other capital actions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So 11% CET1, we're starting to [ph] reap (00:24:53) and we're going to rebuild capital very quickly, right?
Left unchecked, we'll [ph] take on (00:24:56) 100 basis points plus or minus a year on that ratio. So I think as we
get into next year and certainly there's an opportunity to kind of think about buyback, we're a little bit sensitive to
earn back on that. Every quarter, we kind of talk about dividend with the board, so...

Hey, good morning. Jim or John, positive operating leverage, you talked about a lot and you talked about your low

Mark G. Sander A

No, I think, we just keep running the playbook. And to the extent that we have the ability, we're obviously sensitive
to our expenses and we know hopefully some of that expense base is inside our control. As you know, though,
Chris, we've really been trying to manage for the long-term here and want to continue to invest in ourselves, both
from a risk management governance perspective, but also from a offensive relationship management perspective.
And we're going to continue to make those type of investments. But I am sensitive to revenue growth to help
offset any of those investments we make. And sometimes the investments we make, I mean, as we talked about
some of the fee income businesses, the returns are a little bit longer than maybe some of the other businesses
like the balance sheet.
But we've done a pretty good job of managing those tradeoffs and expect us to continue to make those same
types of calls in 2025.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks for that. Any use of capital is related to your fee income initiatives or and even a deal into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. No. I don't see anything – I don't see anything come in the future that's material of any nature. But again we
just know that that's an area, as I think about, treasury management, wealth management we have the right to
win. And clearly mortgage is mortgage and there's been some volatility around that. And we like the – like the
production will ramp today and hopefully it'll continue to grow. But I think it's at an inflection point, around the 6%
kind of 30-year rate. But those two other businesses, treasury and wealth, are ones that we have the right to win.
We have some long-term gains. We have high expectations around the growth of those businesses. And we're
going to continue to build in those businesses specifically.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
As you're talking about – as you're talking about the positive operating leverage and that being a goal, how does
that revenue growth impact, how quickly you may invest in, say, Tennessee, where you see some great growth
opportunities? Do you need to have positive operating leverage or can you if revenue growth maybe doesn't come
in, are you still going to put the dollars forward in that market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, I think that's an area we've got to continue to invest and that is, again, like I said earlier, the growth
dynamics there are unlike any other part of our franchise where we – we have low share, obviously, but there's
high growth. In other parts of our market, we have low share and maybe the growth in total is not as high. So I
think we will prioritize investments in that newer part of our franchise and I would say continuing in some of our
expansion markets as well. Those are going to be key continued investments. And I would rather give up a little
bit on the expense side for kind of longer-term growth. And I think we've been able to kind of navigate those
tradeoffs on a pretty adept basis and continue to deliver our earnings and return profile that you all expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Jim. And then my second question is related to loan growth. And as far as customer demand, what
do you think are the biggest catalysts out there in the marketplace to increase commercial customer loan
demand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Dave. It's Mark. I think just removal of uncertainty, right, as the soft landing is becoming a little bit more
coming clearing the focus. I guess people I think, are the cautiousness that we've seen is starting to abate a little
bit and then people just kind of hang on the election stuff. And they want to get past the election and so, yeah,
they just talk a lot about that. And not that they're frozen, but I think it's making people a little more hesitant. So I
think once we get a little more clarity on those two issues, you'll [indiscernible] (00:29:43). That said, you're
starting to see activity and people refinance some things out in the CRE markets. You're seeing longer term
lenders take things out at a pretty aggressive rate. So you're starting to see – there is sources out there and
demand needs to catch up a little bit.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
David, I would add Mark and Jim have done an excellent job kind of leading us through this different environment
since the spring of 2023, and our expectations have definitely risen in terms of what we want, full relationships,
deposit growth. So, I think that client selection has played a really important part of maybe an all but slower
quarter for the third quarter than we see in the back half of the year or the first half of the year, but that was quite
intentional. We want to ensure that we hit our hurdle rates in terms of the economic pricing and that we bring the
full relationship to the table. And we're much less willing to bet that it will come, and we want to make sure it's
there upfront.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Jim. Appreciate the insight.

James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just as a quick follow-up on that. Is it more competitive, do you think? You're talking about risk-adjusted return
hurdles on lending. But is it more competitive? Is that what's driving your intentional comment or is it something
else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Banking, Old National Bancorp
Hey, Jon, this is Jim Sandgren. No, I think we're starting to see the competitive pressures just picking up a little bit
over the last quarter, so we're still fighting and we have the right to win in all the spaces that we do business in
because of our relationships. So – but it's picking up both on the lending side and the deposit gathering side. So,
again, I like our chances – we like our chances to win and we're doing just that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Thank you on that. John, maybe for you on the – I like that exception pricing chart, the one on slide 7
and then 22 as well. But how quickly is that gap closing? And would you say the reasons for the initial exception
pricing have faded quickly or maybe are no longer there?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think we can close the gap. And, look, clearly we've sort of crested here on both total deposits and the exception
book. But again, Jon, I mean, we're going to stay on offense. I mean, if somebody else is out there flashing a 50%
down beta, I view that as Old National's opportunity. I think we're very much interested in continuing to have
deposits keep pace with our loan generation, and so still putting on good spread, right? And as long as that's the
case, we'll stay on offense on deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. And then, last one on credit again. Maybe hard to answer this, but when I look at the delinquency
and non-performing trends, I think they're still obviously manageable. But what's the signal you want to send us?
Are you expecting the growth to flatten out, to continue to go up a little bit over time? Or are you seeing some of
this stuff start to crest as you look forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Jon, this is Mark. I'll start with delinquencies. That bumped a little bit this quarter based on the CapStar
conversion. It's really an administrative issue, so that I think is a non-event. Honestly, I think that'll come – it's still
at a decent level now and it'll come back down in Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Relative to further risk rating migration, I mean, we could still see some. I mean, it's possible but I think our
potential problems are well-known and closely monitored. And so, while we could still see some downgrades, I
think there is a lot of things that'll mitigate the downgrade activity. Frankly, our conservative and proactive
approach in identifying them early, this expectations for a soft landing which we're starting to see manifest itself
already in some upgrades as well, interest rate cuts and just our aggressive efforts to reduce that book. So, again,
we could see some, but I think we'll manage it well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jon.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take a follow-up question from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. I just had sort of a top-level or strategic question. Jim, as you build capital so quickly, just hoping to get
any updated thoughts on how M&A might fit into the picture. Last quarter, I recall getting the impression that deals

were not high on the list of preferences. But as you look ahead, would the preference be to stay on the path of
increasing tangible book value? Or would we look to deploy some of that into any acquisitions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think what we've said is any future M&A opportunities really have a high hurdle. And as we've tried to
convey, we've got plenty of organic growth opportunities today that we just need to execute on. However, to the
extent that there are opportunities that come along and exceed those very high hurdles we have in place, I think
all of our shareholders want us to look at those things opportunistically. But at the end of the day, we are very
focused on long-term shareholder value creation and anything we look at, has to to meet those pretty high hurdles
we put in place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
