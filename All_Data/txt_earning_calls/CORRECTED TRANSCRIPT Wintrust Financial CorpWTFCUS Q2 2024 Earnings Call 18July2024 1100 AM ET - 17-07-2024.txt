Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Good morning, and thank you. In addition to the introductions that Latiff made, we're joined by Dave Stoehr, our
Chief Financial Officer; and Kate Boege, our General Counsel. In terms of an agenda, I'll share some high level
highlights. Dave Dykstra will speak to the financial results. And Rich will add some additional information and
color on credit performance and loan activity. I'll be back to wrap up with some summary thoughts on two topics, a
high level outlook going forward and an update on our pending acquisition of Macatawa Bank. And of course, we'll
do our best to answer some questions.
For the quarter, we reported net income of just over $152 million and reported record net income of just under
$340 million for the first half of the year. The results were in line with our expectations, with several positive and
encouraging underlying elements. For the quarter, we grew loans by $1.4 billion and deposits by slightly over $1.6
billion. The loan growth was balanced across all material product categories and would have been higher had we
not elected to sell approximately $700 million in loans during the quarter, which Dave will discuss.
The deposit growth included absolute growth in our non-interest bearing deposits and the percentage of non-
interest bearing deposits relative to total deposits remained stable for the quarter. Both the loan and deposit
results are strong and evidence that we continue to gain share in Chicago, the Midwest, and in our niche
businesses. The net interest margin of 3.52% was in line with our expectations and, combined with the growth,
produced record net interest income of $471 million, up almost $7 million from the first quarter.
We are seeing some of the expected credit normalization from the very low levels of delinquency and loss
experienced over the last few years. However, our non-performing loans remain low and loans classified as
substandard or special mention were little changed from the prior quarter. And again, Rich will walk through some
additional detail. Overall, a solid quarter. In particular, I think our team is doing a very nice job with respect to
pricing and credit discipline, which will continue to show up in our results going forward. We are also adding
consumer and commercial clients at a healthy rate, clients that would be with us for years to come.
I'll pause here and hand this over to Dave and Rich, and I'll be back to wrap up.

David A. Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. First, with respect to the balance sheet growth in the first quarter of this – compared to the
first quarter of this year, we again reported strong loan and deposit growth. The deposit growth of $1.6 billion
during the quarter is a 14% increase over the prior quarter on an annualized basis. And as for the deposit
composition, non-interest bearing deposits increased by approximately $123 million in the second quarter relative
to the first quarter, and again, represent a 21% of total deposits at the end of both the first and the second
quarter, so stabilization and a slight increase in the non-interest bearing deposits from last quarter.
The solid loan growth helped to fund strong second – our solid deposit growth helped to fund strong second
quarter loan growth of $1.4 billion or 13% on an annualized basis. Adjusting for the impact of the sale of certain
premium finance loans during the second quarter, total loans would have increased $2.1 billion or 20% on an
annualized basis, and it's consistent with our prior guidance of being above the mid to high-single digit loan
growth for this quarter. Additionally, net of our election to conduct a loan sale transaction that reduced outstanding
premium finance balances by $698 million at the end of the second quarter, the commercial premium finance
portfolio would have been – was up $161 million. The sellable loans during the quarter was done to maintain
appropriate liquidity, capital, and loan-to-deposit ratios.
As to other aspects of the balance sheet results, total assets grew by $2.2 billion to $59.8 billion, and our
regulatory capital ratios remained relatively stable even with the strong growth. As Tim mentioned, it was another

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
very successful quarter for gaining new customers and for the growth of our franchise, which has always been a
primary objective of Wintrust. Our differentiated business model, the exceptional service that our teams provide,
and our unique position in the Chicago and Milwaukee markets continue to serve us well, and we think it will do
so in the future.
As to the income statement categories, our net interest income increased $6.4 million from the prior quarter and
represented a record high amount of quarterly net interest income. An increase in the average earning assets
more than offset the modest decline in the net interest margin that we discussed on our last earnings call due to
the expectations of the strong growth this quarter, and was primarily the result of a mix shift in deposits and the
higher costs of attracting incremental deposits to fund our solid loan growth.
We're obviously happy to take advantage of current market conditions and add high quality loan and deposit
relationships, even if it means a bit of margin pressure. Said another way, these new relationships provide nice
gains in market share, additional net interest income at acceptable returns, and long-term franchise value.
Our second quarter net interest margin was 3.52% and was up slightly from where we ended the first quarter,
which gives us great confidence that our net interest margin can continue to be in a narrow range around 3.5% in
the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of this year. Given the relatively stable net interest margin outlook and
the growth in earning assets, we would expect again to increase net interest income in the third quarter.
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $40.1 million in the second quarter, which was up from a provision of
$21.7 million in the prior quarter, but down slightly from the $42.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last
year. The higher provision expense in the second quarter relative to the first quarter was primarily a result of the
aforementioned strong loan growth and a slightly higher level of net charge-offs and resulted in a buildup of our
credit reserves. Again, Rich will talk about credit and the loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit.
On to non-interest income and non-interest expense. Total non-interest income totaled $121.1 million in the
second quarter, which was down approximately $19.4 million when compared to the prior quarter. As you recall,
the primary reason for the decline was related to a $20 million gain on the sale of our retirement planning and
advisors division that we recognized in the first quarter, and no similar gains were recorded in the current quarter.
And although persistently higher mortgage rates dampened our optimism for stronger spring homebuying season
activity, the company generated approximately $1.5 million more in mortgage banking revenue as we experienced
higher production revenue with a slightly high origination volumes, which was offset somewhat by less favorable
market value adjustments on our mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The company recorded a $4.3 million of
security losses, a modest gain on the sale of our premium finance loans, and a variety of smaller changes to the
non-interest income categories, as shown in the tables in the press release, but those changes relative to the
prior quarter weren't material and not uncommon.
Turning to non-interest and interest expense categories. The total non-interest expenses were $340.4 million in
the second quarter and were up approximately $7.2 million from the first quarter. The primary reasons for the
increase related to salary employee benefits expense increasing by approximately $3.4 million. The slight
increase was due to higher mortgage commissions on the increased origination volumes, second quarter having
the full effect of annual merit increases that were effective on February 1st, and we had slightly higher employee
benefits expenses due to an increased level of health insurance claims during the quarter compared to the first
quarter, which tends to be seasonally low.
Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $4.4 million in the second quarter when compared to the first
quarter. As we've discussed on previous calls, this category of expenses tends to be higher in the second and
4

third quarters of the year to our expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships
and other summertime sponsorship events held in the communities that we serve. The company also recorded a
slight increase in occupancy expense, which was impacted by a $1.9 million charge on the pending sale of a bank
branch in Downtown Chicago as we work to optimize our branch network. This pending sale is essentially
relocation and a downsizing of a branch which will result in lower expenses going forward with an estimated
payback period of less than two years.
Professional fees were slightly elevated due to approximately $532,000 of costs related to the pending acquisition
of Macatawa Bank Corporation. These increases were partially offset by the $4.1 million reduction in our FDIC
insurance expense, as the company recorded approximately $5.2 million of such expense related to special
assessments imposed by the FDIC in the first quarter and no such special assessments in this quarter. The
remaining variances, both positive and negative, were relatively normal and don't warrant any special mention on
this call.
Summary of the second quarter exhibited extraordinarily strong loan and deposit growth, a solid net interest
margin in our expected range, a record level of quarterly net interest income, and excluding the impact of the
charge on the pending branch sale, other non-interest expenses and non-interest income were within our
expected ranges. Again, I'd like to highlight, as Tim mentioned, that this quarter's results combined with the first
quarter produced record net income for any six-month, first six-month period in the history of the company.
We also continue to build our tangible book value per share during the first half of this year. And as you can see
on slide 10 of our presentation deck, we've grown tangible book value per share every year since we've been a
public company, going back to 1996, and we're on track to do so again in 2024. So that's something we're very
proud of. We're excited about the future. We have a solid balance sheet, strong pipelines, and it sets us up well
for future growth in net interest income.
And with that, I will turn it over to Rich to talk about credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As Tim and Dave both noted, credit performance continued to be very solid in the quarter. As
detailed in the earnings release, loan growth for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 13% annualized, net of the impact
from the sale of $698 million in premium finance loans. This growth was driven by a number of factors.
Commercial premium finance loans grew by $859 million before the impact of the loan sale. As noted in the past,
the second quarter is historically when we see our highest funding volumes. In addition, we continue to see the
effects of a harder market for insurance premiums, particularly for commercial properties resulting in higher
average loan size. Finally, we continue to see new opportunities as a result of a consolidation dislocation within
the premium finance industry.
During the second quarter, we also saw growth in core commercial loans, which were up $350 million, driven
largely by quality opportunities resulting from dislocation within the banking landscape in our primary markets. We
also saw good growth in our commercial real estate and leasing portfolios. I would also note that we remain highly
focused on getting paid appropriately for our risk. As noted on slide 7, average loan yields continue to increase,
up 10 basis points during the quarter. We believe that loan growth for the second half of 2024 will continue to be
strong and aligned with our previous guidance of mid to high single-digits for a number of reasons.
Last year's third quarter volume for commercial premium finance loans was very strong. We believe the hard
market for insurance premiums should continue through year end. In addition, our core C&I and leasing pipelines
5

remain very solid. Finally, we saw core C&I line utilization rates trending up from 34% to 37% quarter-over-
quarter. Offsetting this growth would be continued pressure on the volume of new CRE opportunities as higher
borrowing costs have reduced loan demand in that area. We believe that higher borrowing costs will continue to
cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects, business expansion, and equipment purchases. In
summary, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans at attractive rates and maintain our credit
discipline. As noted earlier, loan growth for the balance of 2024 should continue to be strong and within our
guidance of mid to high single-digits.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 15, we continue to see strong credit performance, but with
signs of normalization across the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of ways. Non-performing loans as a
percentage of total loans was up slightly from 34 basis points to 39 basis points. This modest increase in NPLs
was evidenced in both our core C&I and CRE portfolios. And as noted on last quarter's call, we continue to see
slightly lower but elevated levels of non-performing loans in commercial premium finance portfolio, resulting from
ongoing stress in the transportation segment of that portfolio. We continue to monitor this situation closely and we
have started to see this trend stabilize as a result of tighter loan structures and enhanced underwriting. Higher
yields and late charges from this segment of the portfolio continue to offset our credit losses.
Charge-offs for the quarter were $30 million or 28 basis points, up from $21.8 million or 21 basis points in Q1.
These charge-offs resulted primarily from loans within our core CRE, C&I, and commercial premium finance
portfolio. Our portfolio continues to be very solid, well-diversified, and very granular. Evidence of this can be seen
on slide 15, where we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans. We believe that this
quarter's level of NPLs and charge-offs reflect a return to a more normalized credit environment, as evidenced by
the chart of historical non-performing asset levels on slide 16. Finally, we are firmly committed to identifying
problems early and charging them down where appropriate. Our goal, as always, is to stay ahead of any credit
challenges.
As noted in our last few earnings calls, we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real
estate loans, which comprise roughly one quarter of the total portfolio. However, higher borrowing costs and
pressure on occupancy and lease rates continue to affect CRE valuations, particularly in the office category. As
detailed on slide 19, we saw a modest increase during the second quarter in CRE NPLs from 0.34% to 0.40%.
We also saw an uptick in the level of CRE charge-offs as we continue to proactively address and rightsize our
more challenged credits.
On slide 20, we continue to provide enhanced detail in our CRE and CRE office exposure. Currently, this portfolio
remains steady at $1.6 billion or 13.3% of our total CRE portfolio, and only 3.6% of our total loan portfolio. Of the
$1.6 billion of office exposure, 42% is medical office or owner-occupied. The average loan size of our – the
average sizable loan in the office portfolio is only $1.5 million, and we have only seven loans above $20 million
and only four, which are non-medical or owner occupied.
We perform portfolio reviews regularly on our CRE portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers. As
mentioned on prior calls, our CRE credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every non-owner
occupied loan over $2.5 million, which will be renewing between now and the end of the first quarter of 2025. This
analysis, which covered 84% of all non-owner occupied CRE loans maturing during this period, resulted in the
following. 51% of the loans reviewed will clearly qualify for renewal at prevailing rates. Roughly 25% of these
loans are anticipated to be paid off or require a short-term extension at prevailing rates. And the remaining loans
will require some additional attention, which could include a pay down or pledge of additional collateral.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
We continue to back check the results of these tests conducted during prior quarters, and have found that
projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated. And generally speaking, borrowers of
loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support their loans by providing enhancements, including
principal reductions. As we have stated on prior calls, our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or
the market forces behind lease rates, but we continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work
with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes. We believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good
shape, appropriately reserved and situated to weather the challenges ahead.
That concludes my comments on credit and now I'll turn it back to Tim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich. To wrap up our prepared remarks and you've heard me say this on prior calls, we continue to
believe that we're well-positioned, in some cases uniquely positioned in our markets to take advantage of the
current environment with our diverse businesses. The growth this quarter was evidence of that, and while we
wouldn't necessarily expect to see this sort of loan growth going forward, we continue to be very encouraged by
the solid pipelines. As Dave discussed, we believe the margin will be relatively stable in the second half of the
year given the current rate assumptions. With the growth this quarter and the solid pipelines, we believe that
continued net interest income growth is likely in the second half of this year.
With respect to our pending acquisition of Macatawa Bank, there have been good conversations and planning
regarding the integration and the many benefits, financial and otherwise, associated with the transaction. We
remain very impressed with their team and the opportunities that we will have together. We received Fed approval
for the transaction on June 17th. That was quick in today's environment, about 50 days from application, which we
think reflects the relative strength of both organizations and our strong track record regarding acquisitions.
You'll recall Macatawa serves the Greater Grand Rapids, West Michigan market, which is a top 50 MSA in the
United States. They have solid credit quality, a low loan-to-deposit ratio, and a very attractive low cost deposit
book. The loan-to-deposit ratio is approximately 55%, which translates to approximately $1.1 billion in excess
deposits. Macatawa has scheduled their special shareholder meeting to consider approval of the transaction for
July 31st, and we would expect to close the transaction shortly after they receive their final shareholder approval.
Of course, after closing, we will provide additional information on the related financial entries with our next
quarterly results.
At this point, I'll pause and we can take some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC
Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning, good morning. Question for either Rich or Tim on the kind of the near-term, I guess the near-
term loan growth expectations. I mean, this quarter was stronger than I thought it would be and obviously drove
some of the provisioning as well. But what kind of a pullback do you expect in the third quarter? And just if there's
anything else you would call out in terms of the second quarter activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, as I point out, the second quarter is very affected by what happens in the P&C portfolio. And we knew that
was coming. We talked about it at the end of the first quarter. That definitely gets tempered in the third quarter,
but as I pointed out, we're still seeing really nice core opportunities in our primary markets. So I would say that,
we would probably be at the upper end of our range for the back half of the year. Certainly, in the fourth quarter,
you're going to see P&C slow down quite a bit. If you look back at our historic funding patterns, fourth quarter is
probably one of the lower ones. So, third quarter will be very strong. As I said, we'll probably be at the upper end
of the range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon, the only thing I'd add is, the loan growth was broad based, obviously, exaggerated by the P&C
business. But really in all our material categories, we saw growth and particularly some strong growth in the C&I
side of things, which I think is a function of strong market position on our part and to Rich's point, a little bit more
utilization. So, whether that continues to be a tailwind or not, I don't know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Thank you on that. Rich, on the charge-off levels, I think you used the term normalization. Anything
you would call out in the second quarter? It looks like the commercial real estate charge-offs were a bit higher, but
anything else unusual rolling around in there and you expect this – it's hard to say a run rate, but is this more
normal for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. I mean, it's interesting when I was looking at the slides, [ph] look at (00:23:20) slide 19 where we have the
commercial real estate charge-offs, it does pop up quite a bit. And I would point out that we had a number of CRE
8


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
credits that were particularly challenged that we just got ahead of. And just, there were a number of different
stories there. But if you look back to June 30, 2023, I mean, we were at 31 basis points. And so it's just – in the
CRE space, it's just lumpy. We don't necessarily anticipate that we would see a similar third quarter in charge-offs
in CRE, but you just don't necessarily know. We would look at that substandard and criticized page and just point
out that you're really not seeing a lot of movement.
So, it's just these, you have – we don't like to use the term episodic, but sometimes it is. We're just a primary
tenant of a property. You lose it and it's tough to replace. And there could be just these types of issues that affect
that. But generally speaking, I mean, it doesn't feel like Q2 is all that different other than some of these signs of
normalization. When you look at that chart that we point out in terms of historical NPLs, we were at such a low
level that it's just – these numbers feel a little out of sort. But if you take a look at a broader 10-year history, I
mean, we're still at a very reasonable level in terms of charge-offs than NPLs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Good. And then I guess last one. Your philosophy at this point and based on what you're seeing is to
try to hold the reserve percentage relatively stable, is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, certainly, we'd like that to happen. But, Jon, this is Dave. CECL sort of drives that result. Now we show in
our deck, provisioning has always sort of been higher than our charge-offs over the last year or so. So we've been
building reserves. And I think that that's what the CECL model said was that potentially could have more
problematic economic times going forward to a slight extent and so we've built more reserves. And whether that
happens or not, some of those economic factors recently have been getting a little bit better and not as
problematic. So, we have built the reserves.
I think if you kind of look at the provisioning, we've had some people say, well, what should the provision be going
forward, and CECL sort of says you've got to book your reserves based upon the back pattern at that point in time
for the life of the loan going forward. So, future provisioning would really sort of look at loan growth. And
obviously, this quarter, we had really strong loan growth, so that added to the provision, and then just sort of the
normal charge-off levels.
And I mean, if you look at the last three quarters, our provisioning has averaged about $35 million. So, probably,
not a bad place to start. We would think that that would exceed charge-offs again and build reserves. But one of
those quarters was in the $20 million range. And one was a little bit more than what we had this quarter. So, it
fluctuates a little bit, sort of based upon the growth and the economic factors. But probably, from a provisioning
standpoint, $35 million sort of plus or minus depending on growth and economic conditions or if we see any
changes in the classified and other characteristics of the portfolio, which we aren't, as Rich said. It's very
encouraging to us that classified loans, substandard or special mention, those percentages are holding stable.
And actually, if you look at the near-term delinquencies that we show in the earnings release, those are actually
down this quarter from last quarter. So, we're not seeing anything systemic out there. So, as Rich said, the
episodic nature of a couple of smaller deals added to it. But probably, barring macroeconomic changes or
something else, if you're sort of in the mid-30s plus or minus, that's probably a decent estimate of what
provisioning would be going forward. And obviously, we've been higher and lower than that based on economic
factors. But I think that would mean that reserves would continue to build or stay stable. Longwinded

A couple of questions on the NIM, I guess, first on the funding strategy. Your CDs obviously drove a lot of the
growth this quarter. Just wondering, do you guys – is there – you're at 19% of the deposit stack. Is there a limit
that you don't – is there a limit as to how high you want that to go? And then what are your CD operates today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, obviously, to the extent that CDs are your more expensive funding source, you'd prefer to have fewer. But
it's not too recent history when those could have made up 30% of somebody's book. So, I don't think we have a
specific number, but we've shortened most of our promotional CD offering, CD offerings, and their plus or minus
5%. And what I can tell you is that the offerings from approximately a year ago that are now renewing are
renewing at lower levels. And so we think there is some rationalization of the pricing to clients that we acquire with
these promotional rates. But we were committed to funding the loan growth with core deposit growth this quarter
and we've done that. And we've acquired a lot of new customers which we expect will be with us for a long time.

Okay. And then on the loan side of things, so loan yields are up 10 bps to 6.90%. Is the premium finance sort of
the lag on that repricing? Is that now digested? And just wondering, what kind of cadence we can expect in terms
of loan yield lift going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think it pretty well, as you said, digested, Casey. I mean, if you look at both of those portfolios, within a
year, they generally turn over and prime hasn't risen in about a year now. I think we're pretty much through with
those rate increases. We do have back book other fixed rate loans in the commercial real estate area and some
leasing loans, etcetera, that will reprice up. But we still think there'll be a slight lift in the loan yields.
And even on the deposit side, both of those I would say, we probably think probably single-digit basis point
increases in loans and deposits next quarter. So we again expect the margin to stay around 3.50%. So we're
managing that. And even if there's a rate cut of 25 basis points or to the rest of this year, we still think we can hold
the 3.50% margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. Great. And just last one. Sorry if I missed this, but did you guys provide a spot NIM at 6.30%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A

We didn't. But we ended last quarter at the 3.50% range. And this whole quarter averaged 3.52%, so the low
3.50s is where we're at. So...

David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mentioned that a little bit in my comments. I didn't give the number. So we sold roughly $700 million of
those loans and had a gain of a little over $4.5 million. You recall last the last quarter or last year when we sold
the loans, it was a little over $1 million. The pricing, the funding cost of those have really, really come in and the
spreads are tighter. So about a $4.5 million, a little over $4.5 million gain on that sale. But you have to remember,
Terry, that that really just – [ph] present valuing back (00:32:26) the cash flows on those loans and recording the
gain. Had we kept them on our balance sheet, we obviously over the next two quarters would have recorded more
net interest income. But we thought it was prudent to sell them from, like I said, liquidity, loan-to-deposit, and
capital purposes. And those loans come back on the book pretty quickly. That sale of that $700 million, we would
have earned money on those from an interest income perspective in the third and the fourth quarters. But by the
end of the year, that portfolio will have substantially been replaced. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that, Dave. And then within your margin outlook, could you help us maybe understand what you're
assuming for interest bearing deposit costs in the second half of the year? And essentially, what's the cost to fund
that loan growth? And maybe just as a follow up there, you've got 500 – you've got $5 billion of CDs maturing in
the back half of this year. I think it was a 4.75% rate. What are you seeing when those CDs mature? Are they
rolling into market rate products or somewhere else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Both is the answer to your last question. Some clients are rolling into CDs, but as I mentioned, we're shortening
the term of the promotional CDs. And so you're also seeing clients roll into new money market offerings which are
closer to 4% than 5%. And so we'll have to work hard to retain this CD volume and that would, again, continue to
allow us to roughly match deposit and loan growth going forward. Sorry, give me the first part of your question,
again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just interest bearing deposit costs in the second half of this year, they were up obviously in Q2 to fund the loan
growth. What do you think they will do over the next two quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think this was the big quarter in terms of movement on the interest bearing deposit cost that we had some
larger deposits from when rates were substantially lower roll off. And so to Dave's point, I think we're going to see
a much more muted change in the interest bearing deposit costs. Something that kind of should be similar to what
happens to loan yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Again, we think there'll be a single-digit basis point raises in both those categories.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Good morning. Dave, just going back to the NII guide, the linked-quarter is about 1.5%. Is there an
acceleration in the NII growth in the back half of the year relative to this quarter's change, given the growth that
you got this quarter? Or is it mitigated by a little bit of NIM pressure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, we think the NIM is going to hold fairly stable, Chris. I think that the drive will be the earning asset growth.
And really why we believe we can grow NII is that we do think the margin can be held stable here and it'll be
growth in the loans. So we had a great growth quarter. So that's going to carry over into the second half of the
year. And as Rich said, we're at the high end of our mid to high single-digit range. And so, if we're at the high end
of that, it should accelerate more, I would think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess looking out, I mean, the market's fairly fickle, but right now, the market's thinking we're
going to get four or five cuts over the next year. Relative to that 3.50% you've talked about, I know you're a lot
less asset sensitive than you've been, but how much downside to margin do you see if the curve plays out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think we're looking at this year that maybe we have one to two cuts. And next year, whether it's five cuts or
whatever, whichever forecast you think is out there 2025. I mean, if we look at that, we still feel pretty confident
that we can keep our margin in the low to mid-3s, so say 3.25% to 3.5%. It just sort of depends on the speed of
those and the magnitude of those. But we've done a lot of hedging to protect that downside and I think we'd
probably be in that range. So I mean, if we have 10 or 12 cuts, there's probably going to be some stress because
you're going to lose on the spread on your free money, etcetera. So I think there'll be some pressure there, but we
think we can hold it in that 3.25% to 3.50% range based on the current consensus estimate and how to manage it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, you guys are all pretty sharp on picking out things. Yeah, it's up a little bit this quarter. It's kind of nuanced,
but the state of Illinois passed a law that changed the way the apportionment is treated for investment securities
and that will benefit us going forward in future quarters, but we had to revalue our deferred tax inventory because
of the change in the law. So that bumped the rate up a little bit. In the past, we've thought generally our tax rate
was more in the 26.5% range, barring any unusual items in the quarter. We think that's probably closer now to
26%. So we should pick up close to 0.5% in our tax rate going forward. So one of the few times that the tax law
changes in the State of Illinois have benefited us, but we had to revalue our deferred tax inventory, which
increased the tax rate a little bit.

Hey, good morning, folks. Hope you're doing well.

Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Maybe just to start off here, could you maybe unpack the trigger points for any additional loan sales in the future?
I'm guessing if it was to happen, it would probably be in a seasonally strong quarter like this one for the premium
finance business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think that's right. I mean, I touched on it generally, but we've been running that 93% loan-to-deposit.
We really don't care to run much higher than that and we'd like to fund the loans with core deposits. And we
obviously had an extraordinarily strong quarter here. We had $1.6 billion of deposit growth and we just would
rather not have that loan-to-deposit ratio go up or – and we want to keep appropriate levels of liquidity and capital.
So, it's a nice relief valve for us when we have that stronger growth and we'll use it judiciously because we'd
rather have the assets on our books. But we've got to keep those other three metrics in mind, I think. And we
need to be disciplined on the liquidity, capital planning, and follow our playbook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I'd just add, it's a relatively attractive asset to do this with because they turn very quickly, as Dave
described a few minutes ago. And again, after roughly year end, those loans could be back on our books.

David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So yeah, to Tim's point, I mean, we sold about $700 million of that, but the average balance is substantially
less than that because they pay off so fast. So the rule of thumb is you divide it roughly by 2.4 and that would be
your average balance. And so because they pay off so quickly. So it's a great asset class, as Tim says, to sell and
get back on your books quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah [indiscernible] (00:40:49). Dave, one more for me. Within the wealth business, I guess I was a little
surprised to see AUM just tick down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, given how strong markets were in the second

like.

David A. Dykstra A

Yeah. It wasn't anything unusual per se. A couple of clients moved money around to different options, but we
would expect that to grow in the third quarter. So wasn't substantial change.

Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. I think you mentioned last quarter, you saw some, really some targeted opportunities in office still despite sort
of the national rhetoric. And I think you mentioned sort of where higher tenanted or medical. Wanted to kind of
check to see if that's still the case. Do you still see opportunities? I mean, the non-performing loan ticked up a little
bit there but appetite for office, just wanted to check in on how you're feeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's – obviously, we're very careful in that space because of all the dynamics that we talk about. But we did
another office deal this quarter of some reasonable size, not huge, but where you have a investment grade, 100%
tenant building, and we got really good pricing, we got great structure. And because no one else, everybody else
15

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
has got a, probably over allocated towards that space, we're not. So again, want to be very thoughtful, want to be
very careful, but there are still really good deals out there. And our job is always we've talked about this in the
past is never do have to jerk the wheel, never to overreact. And if there are opportunities out there, we want to be
taking advantage of those.
But we're not looking to bulk up on them. We tell our people all the time. It's like, if there's a – because there's
almost limitless numbers of opportunities that you could do here. Our job is to really just pick and choose between
those that are just can't find a home and those that are really, really great opportunities. So, yes, we continue to
be open for business, but very, very picky.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And Rich, I missed the CRE review bucket you referenced. Was that maturing in a certain timeframe? Just
what was that figure again or that you [indiscernible] (00:43:54).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So what we do and we've done this for a number quarters is to we really want to focus about what's ahead
of us and try to think about over the next several quarters. So, what we do is a three-quarter rolling review of what
we're expecting and what we try to do is identify where we may have some challenges, where there's just lease
pressures have been more pronounced or the higher borrowing costs are really affecting that. And we may have
to ask the borrower to curtail the outstanding balance. So we look at every loan over $2.5 million that's coming
due in those three-quarter period. And we just keep track of it.
And the thing that, as I pointed out in my comments, that's interesting to me is just those numbers have been
pretty consistent in terms of those loans that are going to require attention. But I think even more importantly is
just, as we move forward, that we have not seen a huge amount of really any materiality in terms of those
borrowers who haven't supported their properties. So, it's a way for us to kind of look ahead and make sure that
we understand what's coming down the pike and address it as prudently as we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Sure. So, that's a pretty tight timeframe. And I would imagine, as you've undergone that analysis in past quarters,
that's reflective of the current rate environment. So, I mean, not to get, I guess, the confidence in that as you've
rolled that the fact that the statistics have stayed similar, that gives you a pretty good read on credit that nothing's
upcoming, is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's exactly right. And that's our way because our job is to try to get ahead of stuff before it washes up.
And so, this is our way of doing that. Not always perfect, but generally, it gives you a pretty good understanding
as to what you're going to look at. The other thing we – there's a lot of – has been said about like maturity walls.
We look at the maturities pending over the next two years, two-and-a-half years. And we just don't have that. It's a
very consistent number that's coming due quarter-to-quarter. And so, again, our job is just to try to look forward as
much as we can and try to get in front of those borrowers and make sure that we're all aligned in terms of what
the outcome is.

Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good. A lot of talk about the net interest margin here and the sticking around the 3.50% range. As you think about
Macatawa, adding Macatawa, how will that impact the net interest margin? And is that part of that sort of 3.50%
outlook for the next couple of quarters and maintaining that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. The 3.50% we're talking about right now is our current organization. We're not trying to blend in the Macatawa
with it. But Dave, if you think about it, Macatawa is about 5% of our asset base. They have publicly available data,
and they're a publicly traded company, so people can look at the Qs. We'll go through purchase accounting and
revalue all those assets and liabilities to current market value. But once you go through all of that, we think there'll
be a slight lift to the margin. But because of the size of it, relative to the size of Wintrust, it's not going to be
dramatic. It's going to be positive. Most things about Macatawa we think are going to be positive for the
organization as far as growth and culture and margins, et cetera. But we haven't disclosed exactly what that
number is. One, they've got a shareholder vote coming up and we just don't want to try to get out in front of that
17


Wintrust Financial Corp.

and tout this thing ahead of their shareholder vote. But we think it should be marginally beneficial, but not
materially just because the size aspect of it. But as you know, they've got a fair amount of excess liquidity that we
can use since our – a little over 55% loan-to-deposit, we can take those funds and put them into higher yielding
loans fairly quickly. So, we think that will be beneficial, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q

Got it. Thank you for the color. And then the follow-up question I have relates to deposits, and there seems to be
some bit of a resurgence in savings rates in the Chicago MSA, seeing some rates pretty high and guaranteed for
the next six months. What are you seeing on deposit competition, specifically in the Chicago market? And are you
seeing a bit of an increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Subjectively, I would say it's more or less stable, David. I mean, we've been seeing, call it, 6 months to 13, 14-
month type rates of around 5%. The only surprise, I guess, that I would have personally is that some people have
longer terms out there than others. I think we're thinking that those rates should be 5% and down here going
forward. But again, our competitors sometimes do strange stuff.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Well, I mean, if you look at our disclosures, roughly 80% of our deposits are not CDs. So, everything other than
CDs and non-interest bearing deposits are fair game as far as being able to reduce the rates quickly. And it would
be our intention that if the Fed moves on those money market savings, accounts, and even CDs, that we would
cut the rates fairly immediately. CDs would take a while to work their way through. But as Tim said, we've done
fairly short maturities on those recently. So it's not going to take too long for those to work their way through. So,
let's say, you've got 60% of them. If you take out non-interest bearing at 21% and you take out CDs just, under
20%, you got 40% of them that won't price immediately, but you got another 60% that you have the ability to do
that with. And we think we would be active in doing so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Nate. And as a reminder, we really don't have indexed deposits either. Some of our municipal deposits are
sort of tied to a reference rate which is actually trending down a little bit prior to the Fed even cutting. So that's not
going to move the number a ton, but we're watching it carefully.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Very helpful. Changing gears a little bit, we heard from another Chicagoland institution this morning
that there's some increase in M&A chatter lately. I'm curious if – I imagine these are likely smaller deals. I'd
imagine those are [ph] of interest to you guys (00:52:43) just given the size of the company today or if you guys
are still kind of entertaining some smaller scale acquisitions these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we think we're good in terms of acquisition activity. We think we've demonstrated an ability to do it well. The
Macatawa deal is $2.7 billion or $2.8 billion. We think that's about the right size. We would certainly look at
smaller deals if they made sense in terms of branch overlap where you would get more favorable economics from
some sort of cost takeout or if there was a strategic market, we felt like we needed to be in. But I think the right
range for us is, $500 million to pick a number, several billion dollars. We just want good culture, good companies
where we can do integration in markets that we can expand. So I don't know if that helps, Nate, or not, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good morning. Morning. Most of my questions were answered, but I guess as we look at capital, especially
CET1, what should we be thinking about as sort of a target level for that, for you? Is that something that we
should be expecting to sort of be growing higher, closer to peers? Or are you comfortable with it here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think we're comfortable where it's at, obviously. A couple of things I'd say there, Jared. We also have
leverage in our capital stack. We do use preferred securities as capital, which count as Tier 1. They're just not
Common Equity Tier 1. We would expect to grow, continue to grow that number over time here because our
earnings generally are outstripping our capital. This quarter was a little unique given the strong, strong growth, but
we would expect to grow that and get that over 10% here in a reasonably short period of time.
But the limiting factor for us tends to be total risk-based capital in the past and we [ph] man into that (00:56:07).
And if you look in the slide deck on slide 10, that was down a little bit this quarter. But part of that decrease, one
was just the extraordinarily strong growth. But two, we did pay off some subdebt this quarter which didn't count as
capital. But we also had another subdebt issue where we're into the sort of the amortization period of how the
capital is. So we lost 20% of the remaining subdebt capital treatment. And so that will – but that will stay flat until
we get to next June, where we lose another 20% of accounting.
So that accounted for roughly one-tenth of 1% decline in the capital ratios. And if you take that out of the
equation, capital ratio stayed relatively flat. And going forward, we expect the earnings would outstrip the growth.
And we would just continue to grow that number. But we also have a little bit more, we acknowledge this, we have
a little bit more leverage in our capital stack. Our preferred securities are relatively cheap in this environment and
they count as Tier 1 capital and permanent until we decide to redeem them. So happy to have that capital
structure right now, but understanding that we need to get the CET1 probably over 10 sometime in the reasonably
near future.

Okay. Thanks. That's great color. And then maybe just finally, when you look at the charge-offs on commercial
real estate, what's been like the average valuation decline on CRE that you've seen, especially on the office?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
It's such a small population that it's really hard to kind of draw a number there but it's not insignificant. But every
deal is just a little bit different, depending on location and existing tenancy and how effective it is. It's just – I would
hate to throw a number out there because there it's just – the range is so big.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
But nothing that's causing you concern more broadly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, any anytime you have declining valuations, I mean, it's not a good situation, so but I mean, nothing
that's like massively draconian. I mean, it's something that every, again, every situation is a little bit different just
depending on where it's located. And most importantly, what the existing lease structure looks like. I mean, that's
probably the most profound thing that affects them. And generally speaking, we haven't had, again, the nature of
our portfolio is a little bit unique there because we're not looking at super large projects, so you tend to have more
granularity in the tenant base as well. So, we're not seeing huge – but if you have one or two tenants in a building,
and you lose one of them, I mean, that's where you're seeing the most profound effects.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King of Truist.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey, just a follow up on mortgage. Could you give us what your outlook is for the back half of the year and could
you also give us some context as far as the trends you saw, particularly in the late part of the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, well, as I said, we were a little bit more optimistic last quarter that spring buying season would kick in. And
the second quarter was a little better than the first quarter. You could see the numbers that we provided. We had
origination volumes in second quarter for sale of $722 million versus $475 million in the first quarter. So a tick up
there. But we were hoping it would be a little bit stronger than that. Application volume has been fairly stable the
last three or four months and we would expect that probably to stay relatively stable the rest of the third quarter
here, and then probably dip down in the fourth quarter just because of seasonality. It's generally fourth quarter
and first quarter, unless there's a big drop in rates. The purchase activity slows down and our purchase activity is
really roughly 80% of our activity right now, given the interest rate structure. So we would expect that probably to
be relatively flat in the third quarter and to probably dip a little on the fourth quarter unless we see the longer-term
30-year mortgage rates come down dramatically, which is not our base case right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we talked about last quarter, too, it's not for lack of wants. We have a lot of pre-quals that come in all the
time. The issue is really just inventory. So I think people are looking at the mortgage rates and they've been able
21

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
to digest the fact that they're up dramatically over where they were a couple of years ago and people are looking
to buy homes. There's just not a whole lot of inventory out there. And when there is a property that comes online,
it's just – there are multiple offers right away. So that's probably the biggest challenge right now is just, we are as
Dave said, we're 80% purchase-oriented. So if you can't find a home to buy, you can't take out a mortgage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And the other thing I'd add, and Brandon, this is Dave again, as you know, the gross revenue on mortgage
banking now is generally $25 million to $30 million. Once you pay out commissions and other expenses,
fluctuation in that line item, the net effect after commissions, other expenses, taxes is not that dramatic. And we'd
love it to go up and our teams are doing a good job of managing in this environment. And we think doing a really
good job in this environment. But we just don't see it moving enough that it's going to have a dramatic impact on
the net income number of the company. Just because of the net profit on that, we just don't see rates moving
substantially enough to have a dramatic impact one way or the other.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got you. So, with those thoughts on inventory and the issues there, would you say that mortgage could be less
sensitive to decline in rates moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, there's a sort of a dead zone here because you've got a lot of people with very low rates. And so the
beginning of rate decline may not produce a lot of activity, but at some point, you certainly progressively are going
to pick up some volume. It's just a question of kind of when that happens. And I'm reasonably certain that most
mortgage originators know exactly where all of their clients' rates are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Any sense you can give as to where that level is or is it kind of a moving target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Again, I think it's evolutionary. So, you know, 50 or 100 points would help, but a lot of people have mortgages with
a three handle on them. And so you're going to have to get down to much lower levels before you get back to
anywhere near what we saw four or five years ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, just – I don't have a scientific answer to that, Brandon. But our portfolio that we service, the
average rate on that is drifting up and is right around 4% now where it used to be 3.5%. So, I mean, to get a lot of
refis, that have to go down dramatically. But I think that there are people out there that when they had a 3.5% to
4% mortgage rate, they weren't going to go for the 7% to 8% rate. But our gut is that if that rate got into the low 6s
or high 5s that people would say, hey, I really want to get this new house. I'll go from 4 to high-5s. I just won't go
from 4% to 8% or 4% to 7.5%. And so our gut is you'd see a pickup if you got into the high-5s or low-6s. But
again, there's got to be supply out there to buy, too. So I think that will mute it. But certainly when rates came
22

down to the 6s before we started to see a little bit of pickup in activity. So I guess we would think that if you got
into the low 6s, that would be quite helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
