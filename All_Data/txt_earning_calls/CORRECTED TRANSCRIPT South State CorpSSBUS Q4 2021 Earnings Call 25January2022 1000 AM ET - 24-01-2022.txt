Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Thank you, Will, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss the fourth quarter of 2021.
This was the year of transition for the company and one where we move past integration and quickly move toward
execution. I've always felt that the best sign of how a merger was progressing was how quickly the company
returned to growing its customer base post integration.
Our team moved into growth mode almost immediately, and you can certainly see the momentum building in the
company. We're adding customers, adding talented bankers and seeing excellent opportunities to grow market
share in great markets. We were making progress in each of our guiding principles; soundness, profitability and
growth. Our balance sheet remains very strong and growing and this strength will help us achieve the profitability
potential of the bank. 2022 is a year of internal focus, any year where I believe we will make significant further
progress in all three areas.
I will now turn the call over to John.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everybody. I hope you and your families are doing well. As we reflect on 2021, it
was a challenging year in many ways, but I'm proud of the way our team prevailed and successfully completed
the largest conversion in our history last summer. And as soon as the conversion was complete, our bankers
turned on the growth. We continue to see a lot of positive momentum in the Southeast as we accelerate out of
this pandemic cycle.
If we step back and look at loans and deposits this past year, in 2021, we originated roughly $10 billion in new
loans. To put that in perspective, we originated about $7 billion in 2019 before the pandemic, and about $6.5
billion in 2020. So 2021 saw a 40% to 50% higher lending volume in the past two years. And we saw that trend
accelerate in the fourth quarter as loan originations increased another 19% from third quarter levels to a new
record of $3.1 billion. That level of loan production resulted in 7% annualized loan growth in the fourth quarter,
compared to 10% loan growth in the third quarter.
After the vaccines rolled out last spring, we guided to mid-single digit loan growth in the back half of 2021, and we
wound up at 8.5%, so a little better than our guidance. The excess liquidity from the Fed's monetary policy
continues to flow on to our balance sheet. Deposits were up 18% in the fourth quarter even as we drove our
deposit cost down to just 6 basis points. And the excess liquidity in the system continues to lead to elevated loan
pay-offs. Many of our clients have wisely sold their operating businesses at high valuations or sold commercial
real estate to lock in the gain from historically low cap rates.
A few weeks ago, the Census Bureau released the latest population migration trends for 2021, and the conclusion
is clear, the South won the population battle during the pandemic. The Northeast, the Midwest and the West, all
lost population and the South gained 786,000 people. Not surprising, the SouthState footprint is in the fastest
growing markets in the country. Florida ranked number two for population growth behind Texas, followed by
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, placing SouthState in four of the six fastest growing states in
America. The population growth is driving strong housing demand as well as demand for new construction, and
really all housing related products, including furniture, appliances and building materials.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
I'll give you a quick update on Atlantic Capital. Doug is here to comment on the fourth quarter for Atlantic Capital.
They continue to deliver outstanding results, with 22% annualized loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now
received approvals from both the OCC and from the Atlantic Capital shareholders. But we're like many acquirers,
we're just waiting for Federal Reserve approval. We're hopeful for a close in the next couple months, but that is
entirely subject to the Federal Reserve timing.
As we move into 2022, we're excited about our momentum. We've been intentionally patient about deploying our
excess cash. Cash now makes up 15% of our balance sheet, and with an improving economy and accelerating
loan growth, we have a real opportunity to deploy that excess cash into a higher rate environment and drive our
revenue higher in 2022.
I'll turn it over to Will so he can give you additional color.

William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll cover some highlights on margin, non-interest income and on interest expense as well as credit
and the provision for credit losses. Slide 12 shows net interest margin trends. We had net interest income of $258
million in the quarter. The $245 million we reported, excluding accretion, was our best quarter ever for core net
interest income and was up $6 million from the third quarter. Loan yields ex-PPP were flat with Q3 levels, an
incremental improvement in our cost of deposits to 6 basis points combined with $508 million growth in average
loans helped drive the growth in core net interest income.
Although we deployed some cash into loans and securities, our dry powder remains extensive as noted on slide
17. We ended the year with $6.4 billion in interest earning cash and Fed funds sold, up $700 million from the third
quarter and up $2.1 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter deposit growth was $1.5 billion, some of which we
believe to be seasonal or temporary due to municipal tax collections or asset and business sales by clients. We
estimate the more temporary deposit balance growth to be approximately half of the quarter's growth.
Non-interest income improved approximately $5 million from the prior quarter with a record quarter for our
correspondent position and improvement in service charge income somewhat offset by a decline in our mortgage
revenue. As noted on slide 14, mortgage had a strong quarter of production of almost $1.4 billion, but a tightening
of margins and a $156 million decline in the pipeline led to a decline in revenue. Service charge income increased
from Q3 due to the ending of waivers and fourth quarter seasonality. Operating NIE was up $2.7 million from Q3
due to a number of factors, one of which was the loan growth incentive kickers being triggered in the back half of
the year. [indiscernible] (00:08:35) expense categories were slightly higher, as noted in the release.
Turning to credit, our asset quality metrics continue to be very strong as noted on slide 26. We got another
quarter of net loan recoveries before DDA charge-offs of total net charge-offs of 2 basis points. We recorded a $9
million negative provision for credit losses in the quarter. Given the changing nature of forecasts for fiscal stimulus
and the impacts of Omicron, we weighted Moody's S3 scenario of 45% and the baseline scenario of 55%, a
slightly more conservative weighting than for Q3. Ending reserves were 1.27% of loans, or 1.4% including the
reserve for unfunded commitments as noted on slide 31.
On the capital front, we repurchased approximately 632,000 shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2021 full
year total to 1.82 million shares or approximately 2.6% of the company. Our 2021 capital return including
dividends was approximately $282 million as outlined on slide 22. This represented a total payout ratio, dividends
and repurchases, of approximately 52% of adjusted earnings and approximately 59% of reported earnings.

Ending capital level remained strong, with CET1 close to 12%, and ending tangible book value per share was
$44.62.
I'll now turn it over to Doug to give a few highlights on Atlantic Capital's quarter.

Douglas L. Williams
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital Bank, NA
Thank you, Will, and good morning. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share Atlantic Capital's fourth quarter
results with you. As you know, we filed our earnings release and investor presentation last night and those are
available on our website.
I'd like to thank my Atlantic Capital teammates for another great quarter and for a great year. Despite pandemic
related uncertainties and the distractions of merger integration planning, they remain focused on helping our
clients pursue opportunities and meet challenges. Our clients are performing well and continue to make
investments for the future. Those investments are driving our new business pipelines and resulting loan growth.
With strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue, Atlantic Capital recorded another quarter of solid operating
results. As we reported, Atlantic Capital earned $0.57 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared
to $0.65 in the third quarter. Excluding merger related expense, earnings per share were $0.59. For the full year,
we earned $2.45 per diluted share. That figure, excluding merger related expense, was $2.60.
Pre-provision net revenue for the quarter was $14.3 million, or $15.1 million excluding merger expense. Loans
held for investment excluding PPP loans grew 22% annualized from the third quarter and 14% for the full year.
Loan origination volume was strong across all of our banking teams, and net loan growth was particularly strong
in the commercial and industrial and commercial owner occupied real estate categories. Since Atlantic Capital
became a public company six years ago, these commercial loan categories have grown at a compound average
growth rate of more than 13%.
Credit quality is excellent. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 11 basis points of loans. For the full year, net
charge-offs were 6 basis points. Non-performing assets as percent of total assets was 0.11% at quarter end and
classified loans as a percent of total loans was 1.5% compared to 3.25% at the end of 2020. As you've seen, we
recorded a negative provision of $731,000 for the quarter, compared to $2.4 million last quarter. The allowance
for credit losses including PPP loans was 106 basis points at quarter end.
With sharp focus on corporate treasury management business for Atlanta based enterprises and for high volume
payments and fintech companies across the country, Atlantic Capital has built a strong core deposit franchise.
Since we became a public company six years ago, average total deposits have grown more than 20%
compounded annually and average demand deposits have grown at a 30% compound average growth rate.
Payments volumes, service charges and average deposits in the payments and fintech business grew more than
40% annualized during the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, average non-interest bearing deposits increased 33% annualized on a linked quarter basis
and grew 52% year-over-year. Non-interest bearing demand deposits averaged more than 44% of average total
deposits. The average cost of all deposits was 7 basis points.
As we look ahead to our pending merger with SouthState, our new business pipelines are robust and we expect
continued strong momentum in loan, deposit and revenue growth. I'll be available to answer questions during the
Q&A portion of our call this morning. Now, back to John.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So, I'm curious, first, I know you spoke to you'd been patient about excess cash and I think Steve had kind of laid
out some targets in terms of liquidity deployment, expectations last quarter, maybe the quarter previous as well.
I'm wondering if you could give us an update there just in terms of how you're thinking about the pace of
deployment with where rates have moved to now and where they look to be going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Stephen. It's Steve. I think what we've guided to over the last several quarters is that our investment
securities, the assets would be somewhere between 16% and 18% by the end of the year, and I think right now
we're around 17%. As we think about the future, we've got all this excess powder on the balance sheet and today
our loan to deposit ratio with and really without ACBI is 68%. So as we think about the next 24 months, our goal is
to take this loan to deposit ratio from 68%, closer to 80%, in the next two years. And if we can do that, that'll
spend a fair amount of the excess liquidity.
Having said that, there's still probably $3 billion of still dry after all that. And so as we integrate Atlantic Capital into
the mix and investment portfolio, we'll probably have a better guidance as we think about that next quarter once
we get the close there, but right now, there's really no change in that guidance. But just from a big picture
perspective, 68% loan to deposit ratio, going towards 80%, and in the middle of that, we'll put the securities
portfolio together and look at reinvesting it [indiscernible] (00:16:58) opportunistic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, and can you give any color as to where you think expenses are going to go here in
2022, maybe pre-Atlantic Capital? I know that kind of clouds the overall numbers, but on a core basis, can you
talk about where you think expense growth will be and kind of what the drivers of that will be in terms of maybe it's
new hires, maybe it's just inflation and kind of how we can think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Stephen. It's Will. The fourth quarter in a legacy SouthState was up a bit from the third quarter and there's a
few items that we noted in there in the release. And as I mentioned I think in our third quarter call, our goal for
2022 is to try to hold the inflation and NIE to low single digits, and that's certainly our plan in our budget. We do
recognize there's an inflationary environment that we're all subject to and that we have to compete in the market,
but that would be our plan.
So if you look at the Q4 run rate, up a bit from Q3, something in that general range, where we were in Q4 to
maybe a little bit higher is sort of how we see things shaping up in 2022. But again, we'll have to compete with
market forces and react accordingly. But that's our plan right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you, Stephen. We'll now move over to Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael, please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to talk about slide 13, I think it's really
compelling, the fact that the origination volumes have been up so nicely year-on-year. Obviously, the pay downs
have been an issue, Doug has obviously grown it at a really high rate as well. When do you think the pay down
slows, is it as rates rise? You talked about M&A activity and selling businesses and things like that, but when can
we expect to see a more robust pickup in net loan growth? Any commentary would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's John. Good morning. For the back half of the year, we wound up at about 8.5% annualized
loan growth, it was 10% in the third quarter, 7% this quarter. But, yeah, to your point, it's kind of interesting, our
loan production went up but our net growth went down. And so we spent some time analyzing that. And sure
enough, we looked at our big pay-offs and we had about $170 million more of large pay-offs in the fourth quarter
than we did in the third. And you go down the list and it's, yeah, it's family businesses, multi-generational
operating companies that sold. We had a lot of real estate investors that are selling CRE at these record low cap
rates to get the gain.
So, I do think that interest rates play a big, big part of this and the extra liquidity in the system. So, we kind of
thought that at this level of loan production, we ought to be producing high single-digits to 10% if we could slow
the prepayments down. So, I think as interest rates drift up, you're going to have less prepayments on residential.
And as interest rates drift up, the cap rates are going to move up on CRE and those gains are going to be less, so
there's probably going to be less churn in the CRE portfolio. So, I feel – I'm real pleased with the level of
production and if you get a little less liquidity in the system, a little higher interest rates, it could very easily move
into high single-digits to 10% loan growth where we're at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, John. And then, maybe just following up on slide 19, because I think this is also
pretty compelling. I don't know if this is for Steve or Will, but if you can comment on some of the assumptions for
that one-year change which is relatively unchanged from last quarter in terms of what that implies in terms of
securities portfolio, deployment, deposit betas, etcetera? And then, what the impacts could potentially be based
on initial purchase accounting marks and the like from the addition of ACBI? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yes. Yeah. Michael, it's Steve. And maybe Will can follow up with anything I missed, but all this is doing is taking
our balance sheet as a point in time static balance sheet that's not growing it for securities or anything like that
and just shocking at the rate, 100 basis points across the curve. And so when you look at that number, what it
does is it makes the net income of the bank go up about 15%. Now, we all know it's not all going to be 100 basis
points on one day, but this is directionally just tells you as you incrementally move 25 basis points what have you
that's how that would play out per our model.

South State Corp.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Couple things to note on that slide, too, is our floating rate loans are around 31% on a daily basis. And then we
have about another 20% that are variable and a lot of that re-prices in the first year and only 49% fixed. So that
drives some of it, but I kind of go back to what really is the asset sensitivity to our entire franchise. Obviously, we
have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet today that we normally don't have, so 15% of assets that's
obviously a driver.
Number two, our floating rate loan portfolio is probably well within peers and pretty normal for our size. But the
piece that I think is probably the most important is just our deposit portfolio and the power of our franchise in a
rates up environment. We have a slide in here that details our deposits, but we have 59% of our deposits are in
checking accounts versus 41% for our peers. And so that's just a significant advantage or change, we have
816,000 checking accounts and 1.2 million total accounts, in higher rates that's when the betas stay lower than
hopefully peers, and that's where you outperform. So all of that is built into this model, but hopefully that helps
answer your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And Steven, as well I'll just elaborate a little bit on that. The modeling we use does incorporate our historical
deposit betas, and as Steve just alluded to, one thing that's a little bit different this time around is that we're
entering this rising rate cycle with a much lower loan to deposit ratio. If you look back to the last – and I think we
ended second or third quarter of 2019 with a loan deposit ratio in the low to mid 90s, 93%, 94% or so. And as
Steve said, we're at 68% today, and that's not uncommon. So the question will be, how different betas this time
around given all the liquidity on all of our competitors' balance sheets? Absent a big removal of all that liquidity
very rapidly, one would expect that betas would be lower across the industry this time around, and we'll see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And just to marry up one other thing, I know we'll have 10-K disclosures that will come out at some point, but this
is a net income disclosure not a net interest income disclosure. So net interest income disclosure will be closer to
9% but the net income disclosure is what we have here which is probably the more pertinent one that you will
hear about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Helpful, because I think that's up quarter on quarter, correct? Because I think the NII sensitivity in the last quarter
was closer to 6% and now you're saying 9% for NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
It's 9% with the shock, a ramp was around 6%, so that may be – it may be what you're thinking, Michael. I don't
think it's changed that dramatically quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Understood. Maybe just one final one for me. So Steve, maybe if you can go into the increase in
correspondent banking, this quarter is a little bit more than we are expecting. Can you just talk about the, the puts
and takes as we think about 2022? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Yeah. It was a really great quarter from the correspondent team, and kind of the driver of that this quarter
was our interest rate swap business, like this quarter was up about $7 million quarter to quarter. Actually, our
fixed income business was down couple of million dollars. And it really comes back to, if you think about the – for
the environment we were in, in the fourth quarter, it was – just like us, there was a lot of loan production that was
going on, and then also the yield curve was a little bit flatter in the fourth quarter before steeping up in the first
quarter. So those ingredients, along with just great loan production kind of caused the fourth quarter to be very
strong and fixed income to be a little weaker, but ultimately up $5 million. So very happy about that.
As we think about overall fee income, our guidance hasn't changed for that in several quarters. I think we've laid it
out as a percentage of assets and what we've said is, on a standalone, SouthState would be 80 to 90 basis points
on a standalone basis. And with Atlantic Capital, combined, would be more like 75 to 85 basis points non-interest
income to assets. And we don't really see that change in a whole lot – over the next – the course of the next 12 to
24 months. So I hope that's helpful.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Question about your buyback appetite at this point over the next several months, how are you thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Hi, Jennifer. It's John. The board authorized a buyback of 5% of the company about a year ago, and we're a little
more than halfway through that, 1.8 million shares out of the 3.5 million. So we bought back 2.6% of the company.
Our thinking is, we're continuing to generate excess capital. We do not believe that we're going to be growing.
There's no need to grow the balance sheet because we've got so much liquidity today, so we think we'll continue
to generate excess capital. And we think that as interest rates rise in the course of the next year or so, bank
valuations will improve. So we think it's a good time to put our capital to use in buybacks. So we've been
reasonably active in the last two or three quarters. And if the valuations stay close to where they are today, we'd
probably continue to stay active the next couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Right. And what is your outlook on the correspondent banking area for the next year with higher rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Jennifer, it's Steve. I think what we've said over the course of several quarters is that we'd be ranging
between $24 million, $28 million. This quarter we hit $30 million, which was a really good quarter for us. But I
think the same guidance and it's kind of the same, same as what we've talked about, and I'll tell you why. Back to
all of this excess liquidity in the banking system and all of our clients, they all have this excess liquidity, some
have more than others, and they're going to do one or two things with it over the next 24 months just like we are.
Either they're going to loan it or they're going to invest in. And so for us, we have the products to both sell them on
the fixed income side if the yield curve gets steeper, or if the yield curve gets flatter, it'll probably be more interest
rate swap business. There's a slide that we put out there on page 15 and it shows the last I think five quarters of
fee income for the correspondent. We have 1,060 financial institution clients, and you can see it's reasonably
steady, but for different reasons. Sometimes the ARC revenues, which is our interest rate swap business, does
better in the environment, and sometimes our fixed income does a little bit better and a lot of that really depends
upon the yield curve and how that move. So I hope that's helpful.

Good morning.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One more follow-up on fees. On just service charges, I was surprised to see the increase this quarter. I'm
assuming some of that's just kind of a higher seasonal fourth quarter like we typically see. But how do you think
about the outlook for service charges and some changes we're seeing in overdraft fees in the industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Why don't I take the quarter and then let John take the outlook going forward. So you're right, Catherine, it's two –
really two components accounted for that roughly $4 million pick up. One of it is just seasonal card use, Christmas
shopping, etcetera, that occurred. And then the other bigger factor was, we still had some waivers in place in the
third quarter post conversion. We did the conversion in the second quarter, kept some waivers out there. Fourth
quarter, those are all expired, so we have none of those in the fourth quarter. But the combination of those two
items really led to the increase quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. And as far as going forward, clearly the market is moving very quickly, Catherine, as it relates to overdraft,
fees and practices. And I would just tell you that that's something we continually evaluate, we continue to make
adjustments to and we'll do that in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Generally, as you look at the service charge number, it's hard because we haven't really seen a full kind of normal
year of service charges with SouthState and CenterState combined since the first time we saw that together was
COVID. So do you think we're still not at a full kind of operating run rate that truly shows the benefit of the
merger? Is that fair? Do you think there's still this kind of headwinds that maybe this quarter's run rate is maybe
kind of more appropriate base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Catherine, I'd say my impression is that the fourth quarter did have some seasonality. I know we have that most
fourth quarters, I guess, as long as consumer behavior is where it is. But the fourth quarter is the first quarter
where we didn't have any of the waivers. And so if you normalize for a little bit seasonality, maybe the fourth
quarter's run rate is a pretty good look of where we are legacy SouthState. We don't have a good year of history
to show you yet, obviously with the conversion occurring in the second quarter and then the waivers that we did
and then the fourth quarter of course having some seasonality. So.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That makes sense. That makes sense. And then on loans yields, that's actually stayed in a little bit more stable
than I was expecting. So any kind of color you can give on loan pricing and where you think that loan yield maybe
bottoms before we kind of get – start to get the benefit of higher rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Sure, Catherine. This quarter I think our loan yield for the portfolio ex-accretion, all of that was around
[ph] 3.77% (00:33:53). And our going on yield for loans within the [ph] 3.13% (00:33:58) range, I think, for this
quarter. And a lot of that, as you know, has to do with where you are out on the curve. We had a fair amount of
production and a fair amount of that we ended up swapping to floating ratios because we felt like maybe the Fed
would probably start moving rates [ph] the same way that (00:34:17) our clients did. So, the way I think about that
is, if we can get rates to move up from a Fed fund LIBOR perspective 31% of portfolio, we should be bottoming
out here in the next quarter or so. And then from there, we'll start increasing with the rest of the market.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thank you, ma'am. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the accretion income relative to total NII. Will, the slide
you gave was very helpful. Just as a reminder, does that relationship change much with a CBI coming in or will it
continue to decline this next two years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Let me tell you maybe in components, so PPP deferred fee accretion, that's essentially gone. I mean, we've got a
little bit less in the balance sheet but that's – take that or remodel if you hadn't already of course. And I'd say, our
normalized run rate for the regular [ph] required accretion as of (00:35:33) today, we think of that in the sort of the
$5 million to $6 million range. This quarter, it's a little bit higher than that. And some of that's hard to predict, but
that's sort of how I think about it. We don't anticipate the accretion on the Atlantic Capital side dramatically
changing our accretion. We don't think accretion will be a big part of the story post Atlantic Capital closing, so not
a big number of addition there in our modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And Chris, I'll just add that I think what we've said a couple of quarters ago that as we thought about 2022 was
that our accretion income would be somewhere in that $5 million to $6 million range and after we got through
PPP, so I think it's the same that we've said for the last several quarters.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great, Steve. Thanks for that. And Will, thank you as well. Just a quick follow up on Doug and Pat from Atlanta
Capital. The change in cash and deposits that we saw at period end, was any of that seasonal for them? And is
that something that would come back the first half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas L. Williams A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital Bank, NA
Chris, this is Doug. Some of it is seasonal. We see that every fourth quarter. But there's also some strong organic
growth in the midst of all that. So, I think perhaps it would be modestly lower in the first quarter of this year, but
not significantly. So, Pat, would you...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Timothy Oakes A
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Secretary & Treasurer, Atlantic Capital Bank, NA
Yeah. So, Chris, if you look at the average deposit growth, right, it's pretty flat. And part of that was that's driving
down some deposit costs in particular products. That probably caused a decrease. If you carve that piece out, it
was actually up for the quarter. And then the period end number, it just depends on the day of the week especially
with our payments business. It was up significantly at 9:30 because it's a Thursday. And then at year-end, it was
down because of the day of the week was on a Friday. So, you really have to look at averages when you look at
that.

And, Chris the mix has also continued to change more toward non-interest-bearing DDA? DDA was – non-interest
bearing DDA was 44% on average in the fourth quarter, that was up from the third quarter. And those deposit –
that category of deposits continues to grow at a very strong pace.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I wanted to ask just a follow-up on the ARC revenues. I just wanted to clarify, was that all kind of like what you
would consider operating or were there any kind of mark-to-market gains within that just because the $7 million
quarter-over-quarter increase is relatively large?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
No. No, it was all organic, no mark-to-market in that. I mean, if you remember, I don't know if I've described it on
this call or another, but in 2020 when the yield curve was flat, that business did $80 million in revenue for the year
2020. So this quarter of $17 million is a really good quarter, but not a record quarter by any means. But it's better
than this than over the last couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe one more on fees, just the mortgage production. It looks
like you are continuing the balance sheet a relatively larger mix of mortgage production than you historically have.
So I guess I wanted to ask, one, why; and then two, if the gain on sale margins are going to track this level going
forward, do you envision maintaining that mix of portfolio versus secondary just given that the margins are starting
to get a little slimmer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, this is Steve. I think you're referencing page 14, and hopefully this disclosure that Will put together
in the last couple of quarters has been helpful, and it's helpful for me as we look at it. Yeah. The mortgage
production [ph] perspective (00:39:59) it's very robust. I mean, it was almost $1 billion for this quarter, last quarter
was $1.3 billion, and then fourth quarter last year, which was an excellent quarter, was $1.4 billion.
So really year-to-year, the production – 2020, which is a record year for us, was $5.5 billion, this year we did $5.4
billion. So, congratulations to that team. They've just been really working hard and doing well. The things that
strike me on this page are a couple of things. One is if you look at the trend on the gain on sale margins, a year
ago they were 4.56%, now they're 2.83%. Well, the 2.83% is just much more of a normalized gain on sale
margins so there's nothing to be alarmed about that, it's just more normal. But that's down 170 basis points, which
is obviously taking away some of the fee income.
And that's why I think what you see in the top right column there is we're moving more of that production, which
was a year ago, 72% secondary, now down to 53% secondary. And so I would assume that as we kind of move
forward here in the higher rates and we're getting more opportunities to do ARMs on balance sheet, we'll have
more of an opportunity to continue kind of that mix. So I would say that, 55% secondary, 45% portfolio would
probably be a good mix. And some of the things that are driving that again to the portfolio is just there's just a lot
of new construction on single family homeowners who are kind of there and doing a custom built house, because
there's just not a lot of inventory, so we're doing a lot of that and we're doing a construction loan and then are
putting an ARM on it on the back end.
So anyway, it's a lot of commentary, but I would just describe it's a really strong production year for that portfolio.
We saw in the fourth quarter, consumer real estate went up around 6%. If you pulled out [indiscernible] (00:42:00)
it's been more like 9%. So I kind of see that as sort of a good run rate going forward.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just on the origination yields, the [ph] 3.13% (00:42:12)
was down 5 bps I think quarter-over-quarter, similar to the core loan yield without any accretion. And so I guess
just as we think about new origination yields going forward, I know that we've all got our own different kind of Fed
rate hike assumptions, but do you expect maybe further compression on new origination yields in the first and
second quarter of the year depending on what the Fed does? Can you help us think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Probably the way I would say it is, average loan size this quarter was up a little bit. And so typically, as you
get a higher new loan origination those spreads tighten up a little bit just because of the nature of that. So I guess
it probably depends upon our mix. At the end of the day, we have a loan pricing model that prices to the curve.
And so as the curve moves up, we still want to continue to get our spreads. And there's always a dance in there,
particularly when rates rise for the first quarter or two. But long term, that model works, and overtime, you do get
the spreads.
The question is, with all the liquidities getting in the system, will you get it this year or this time, which is a great
question. I don't think any of us know the answer. I do know that when securities yields go to 2.5%, you can do it
risk free, it makes it a whole lot easier on the loans, to be more disciplined on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just on the loan growth rate, particularly within C&I. So you all had a good year here. I think
it was up like 13% when you excluded [ph] AMP, PPP (00:43:53) related loans. But this quarter was a little bit light
relative to [ph] H8 (00:44:00) and what some of your peers were putting up. And so I wanted to ask, was there
anything specific that drove that beyond the business sales that you noted, John? And if you could help us think
about the size of those paydowns within C&I, it would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Sure, Brody. If you recall in the third quarter, we had a seasonal surge in C&I loans that was attributed to some
hurricane cleanup business that we do, and we mentioned that, that would start to tail off seasonally in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter. So that was a little bit of a headwind, but we're still happy year-over-year, C&I has
grown 13%. And a lot of that is attributable to the middle market bankers that Greg Lapointe has recruited and
brought in to the company. But I do think that this particular quarter at a 6% growth, it was probably that
seasonality to hurricane business as well as just more of these operating companies selling and paying off at a
higher rate than they did in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Thank you for that. And if I could just sneak in just a couple more quick ones. On slide 25, you have given
really good detail around the checking accounts. And I wanted to ask, do you know if that two-third and one-third
mix of commercial versus retail checking and it's similar to what it was last cycle on a pro forma basis?

Yeah. Brody, this is Steve. I don't think we've checked that number. It's a good question, but I don't think we've
looked at it pre-LOE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:45:42). Yeah. I don't think so. I would ignorantly say it's close to that, Brody, but we haven't put
that together. So, good question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then just one on the securities book. Do you happen to know what the duration, the effective
duration of the AFS portfolio is? And then, for the total portfolio, do you know what percent of the book is floating
rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I think our effective duration for the entire book is around 4.7 years. I think the floating piece is about 6% of
the book. So, really, most of those are fixed securities. When we – and as part of my comments, when we bring
on the book for ACBI, they have a little bit of a longer portfolio. We'll examine all of that when we put the fair value
marks, depending on [ph] which day (00:46:33) we close and put all that together at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And Brody, that was for the full portfolio, the answer Steve gave. We don't it have broken up by AFS and HTM.
My guess would be that AFS would be a little bit shorter. Just good way [ph] you put an HTM tip (00:46:49), we
don't have it precisely in front of us.
