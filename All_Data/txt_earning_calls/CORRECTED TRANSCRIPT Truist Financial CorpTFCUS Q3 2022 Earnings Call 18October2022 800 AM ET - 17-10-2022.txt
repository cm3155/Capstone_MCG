William H. Rogers Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone, and thank you, for joining our call today. Our third quarter reflected
strong progress in many areas overall. However, financial performance was mixed, reflecting continued
challenging market conditions. Strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded
our guidance and strong broad-based loan growth. Credit quality remains excellent. At the same time, capital
markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated, and in fact, declined linked quarter.
Strategically, we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating which I'll share more on
later. I acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high. However, other expense growth reflects
targeted investments in talent and technology in key areas of long-term sustainable growth. Merger costs
diminished again and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and will be finalized by year-
end. We'll share details on each of these themes throughout the call.
I'm turning to our purpose on slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company that's dedicated to inspire and build
better lives and communities. This commitment to purpose and our value of care cannot have been more
apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. I
experienced this firsthand when I visited with our teams in Southwest Florida soon after the storm subsided.
Clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time of
loss. The many truckloads of food, water, supplies, and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real
difference. And the $1.25 million donation from the Truist Foundation will continue to provide support to affected
areas in Florida and South Carolina.
The rebuilding process has only begun and Truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term,
but also helping them be more resilient in the long-term. And this is one of the many ways we're living our purpose
as you can see on slide 5. In order to inspire, it's often necessary to be bold, and to be first. And that's exactly
what we did on October 1st, we made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to
$22 per hour. The new minimum wage benefits approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom are in
client-facing roles. We strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth, and offset the estimated $200
million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention, lower
turnover expense, better execution, and all around better client experience.
In fact we're already starting to see the benefits of higher minimum wage. Teller turnover in August and
September was down about 25% compared to the first seven months of the year. And our branch vacancy rates
have been cut in half since July.
We also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of Truist One Banking in July. Truist One is our
differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking including two new accounts that
eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero
overdraft fees and the capability provides qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative
balance buffer.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account which provides consumers access to mainstream banking
services and no overdraft fees. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and
have been embraced by new and existing clients. Since their launch, overall branch deposit production has
increased 13% in August and September compared to the prior year despite having 16% fewer branches.
We're also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750. We began a pilot
earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter.
Now turning to slide 7. Merger costs totaled $152 million, down 30% sequentially and 58% year-over-year as our
integration activities wind down. The final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our
decommissioning efforts, which, as I mentioned, will conclude by year end. The completion of merger activities is
a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience, simplify our narrative, enhance our
earnings quality, improve capital, and help us realize industry-leading returns.
Turning to our third quarter performance highlights on slide 8. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.15 per share on a
reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.24 per share up 3% sequentially as 5% adjusted
PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net charge-offs.
Net interest income grew 10% to a post-merger high, benefiting from higher short term rates, and well controlled
deposit cost, all of which drove significant margin expansion, as well as strong broad based loan growth.
Despite solid forward progress, the pace of PPNR growth was weaker than we had anticipated primarily due to
ongoing pressure on investment banking as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end. Adjusted
expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter mostly as expected, however, operational losses remained elevated.
While we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses, our overall goal is to
reduce them significantly to improve our results from the client experience. This is an industry-wide phenomenon,
part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort. These investments include efforts to enhance identity,
authentication, and fraud detection among others.
Adjusted operating leverage was a strong 260 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year reflecting
strong net interest income growth combined with modest expense growth. This momentum has helped us close
the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year 2022.
Asset quality remains excellent notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick, and net charge-offs
within our consumer portfolios.
We deployed 10 basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and completed the BenefitMall acquisition
which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business. Our capital position
remained strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and we're confident in our ability to withstand and
outperform in a range of economic scenarios.
Now turning to slide 9. Digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels reflecting strong
momentum post integration. This progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from
being on one digital platform. Year-to-date, we've delivered three times more production releases across
business, retail, and wealth than in all of 2021. Client satisfaction with the digital experience has also improved
rapidly each quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Consistent with our pivot from integrating to operating, our technology, and digital teams are allocating more of
their time, energy, and resources to transformation and innovation. To that end, we recently launched Truist
Assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms. Truist Assist is our AI-
enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to
interact and respond to client questions.
Through September 30, Truist Assist has been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by
114,000 unique clients to handle 147,000 interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact
center. We're also expanding LightStream, both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models
through artificial intelligence and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set.
In addition, the recent acquisition of the Arena platform from software startup Zaloni will help accelerate our data
journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud
environment. As a result, our data quality, analytics, and speed-to-market will all significantly improve. Overall, I'm
highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and
client experience.
Now turning to loans and leases on slide 10. Loan growth was strong and broad-based for the second
consecutive quarter. Average balances grew $13 billion, or 4.3%, sequentially, in part due to our shift from
integrating to operating. C&I remained strong as average balances grew $7 billion or 4.5%. C&I loans grew
across most CIB industry verticals and product groups, reflecting higher revolver utilization, the current shift to
banks from the bond market, and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients. Revolver utilization
increased just over 100 basis points to approximately 31%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2020.
In our Commercial Community Bank, C&I balances, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan, increased 1.3% the
seventh consecutive quarter of growth. We achieved growth across almost all of our CCB regions.
Residential mortgage balances increased $4 billion, or 8.2%, reflecting previous correspondent mortgage
production and slower prepayment speeds. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased 3.1%, a
strong growth in prime auto, Service Finance, LightStream, recreational lending, and Sheffield more than offset
runoff in our partnership and student portfolios.
Production in our consumer finance business is up 20% year-over-year reflecting good business development
momentum with Service Finance, abating inventory shortages within Sheffield, and RAC, and improved
automated decisioning capabilities across the board which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency, and
creates better client experiences.
Near term, our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong, and teammates
continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating, and take advantage of new tools in their toolkit.
Over the medium term, loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates, higher
inflation, and slowing growth. We also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to slow going forward
as we shift our capital towards higher return opportunities. Truist continues to remain well positioned to advise
clients across a broad range of economic scenarios given our capabilities, talented teammates, and increased
capacity post integration.

Now turning to deposits on slide 11. Average deposits decreased $3.7 billion or just under 1% in the third quarter,
driven by tightening monetary policy, reduced saving, and a response for higher inflation and seasonal patterns.
Deposit costs were very well controlled reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable
market share position. In addition, our lines of business, and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver
excellent execution against our thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while
maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing cumulative deposit betas have been 21% thus
far, well below our modeled assumptions.
As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth
and rate paid particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding.
Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge and thank Daryl Bible. He has built a best-in-class finance
function. He played a key essential role in the success of our merger and he's really been incredibly supportive in
helping Mike transition into the CFO role. Many of you in the investment community know Daryl well and
appreciate his knowledge and transparency, which will continue to be hallmarks of Truist going forward.
I'm also excited to introduce Mike Maguire as our new CFO. Most recently, Mike led Truist's consumer finance
and payments businesses, including LightStream, Service Finance, and Sheffield, and auto finance. He was also
responsible for our enterprise payment strategy group and wholesale payments businesses including treasury
solutions, merchant services, and commercial card.
Mike is a strategic banker, a purpose driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise,
and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment. He's truly an industry thought
leader in the fintech space. We'll certainly draw on this experience as Mike assumes his new role during this time
of exciting transformation.
So Mike, with that, I'm going to turn it over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
.
Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to thank Daryl for his guidance and
his support throughout my transition into the CFO role. I'm excited about the opportunity and I'm confident that the
transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders. I also want to thank my teammates in the financial
organization for welcoming me, and for their support. We have a really talented team and I'm look forward to – I
look forward to working with all of them. For our analysts and investors, I'll be on the road soon, and hope to meet
as many of you as possible. This is really a great opportunity and I'm excited about helping take Truist to new
heights.
Now moving to slide 12, for the first – for the quarter, net interest income increased 10% sequentially to $3.8
billion as higher short-term interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting
accretion. Core net interest income was up a strong 14%. Deposit costs remained well-controlled reflecting the
strength of our deposit franchise.
Lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion
activity and slowing prepays in the current period. Reported net interest margin increased 23 basis points while
core net interest margin increased 30 basis points driven by similar trends as net interest income.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Moving to slide 13. Fee income decreased $146 million or 6.5% sequentially. Insurance income decreased $100
million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions. Investment banking and trading
income decreased $33 million as lower fees from structured real estate, investment grade in high-yield bonds,
and syndicated leverage finance were partially offset by increased M&A fees. Wider credit spreads, tightening
liquidity, and general macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels.
Despite these current headwinds, we continue to make strong strategic progress within corporate investment
banking. Capital markets revenue from non-corporate investment banking clients is up 25% year-over-year as our
Commercial Community Bank, commercial real estate, and wealth teammates continue to learn how to
successfully partner with CIB to deliver strategic advice to our clients.
Our lead table position has improved across most products including equity capital markets, high-yield,
investment grade, and syndicated leverage finance. Given their strategic progress we intend to continue to take
advantage of the challenging environment to invest in Truist Securities by selectively adding talent to drive long-
term share gains as we've successfully done during previous market disruptions.
Other income, excluding impacts from our nonqualified plan, decreased $17 million linked quarter primarily due to
valuation related marks. Compared to a year ago, other income decreased $81 million as a result of lower
investment income and valuation marks on SBIC related and other strategic investments.
Turning to slide 14. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $83 million or 2.6% sequentially reflecting forward
focused investments in talent and technology as well as elevated operational losses. Professional fees and
outside processing expense increased $34 million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects including
investments in cybersecurity, contact center modernization, fraud detection, and the build-out of our in-house
payments capabilities.
Other expense increased $28 million primarily due to higher operational losses.
Personnel expense increased $23 million on an adjusted basis reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in
technology, Commercial Community Banking, CIB, consumer finance, and wealth as well as the BenefitMall
acquisition.
Compared to the third quarter of last year adjusted noninterest expense only increased 2%. This modest increase
was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend which were partially offset by merger-related cost
savings in software and net occupancy expense. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions
in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating
leverage.
As an example, we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication, fraud detection
among other factors will mitigate operational losses. Also, with the conversion behind us, we have additional
flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage where capacity exceeds demand.
Lastly, we have our final leg of data center related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout
the fourth quarter. Below the line, our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 18.2% down from
19.5% in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final true-ups to our 2021 tax
return. We continue to expect our normal effective tax rate to be 20% which translates to 21% on a fully taxable
equivalent basis.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Moving to slide 15, asset quality continues to be excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio.
Leading credit indicators remain strong. Nonperforming loans decreased 1 basis point and loans 30 to 89 days
past-due decreased 7 basis points.
Net charge-offs remained benign at 27 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter primarily due to
normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios. Our total allowance increased $18 million to
support our loan growth, and the ALLL ratio decreased 4 basis points due to strong portfolio performance and
growth in higher quality loans partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook.
Moving on to slide 16. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.2% to 9.1% as we deployed capital to support strong
loan growth and to complete the BenefitMall acquisition. We also increased the dividend 8% to $0.52 per share
beginning in the third quarter reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory.
Overall, our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, and we maintain a strong
liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth.
Turning now to slide 17, I'll next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of two recently announced
insurance acquisitions. First, BenefitMall closed on September 1st, providing a scaled entry into wholesale
employee benefits, and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set. BenefitMall is expected to
add $160 million of annual revenue at an initial EBITDA margin in the mid 20% that we'll build to the mid-30%
over time as synergies are realized. The transaction also has potential IRM benefits within Truist Insurance by
supporting our brokers at McGriff, our retail insurance business and also outside Truist Insurance with our
corporate and commercial clients.
We also recently announced acquisition of BankDirect Capital Finance. Strategically BankDirect effectively
doubles our premium finance business, broadens our capabilities to include life insurance, and expand our West
Coast presence. Pro forma, we estimate Truist Insurance Holdings will be the number two premium finance player
in the market after this deal closes later this quarter. BankDirect brings with it a $3.2 billion loan portfolio with
strong projected growth, attractive profitability, limited credit risk, and short duration.
While both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially, we believe they are strategic and financially attractive
over the long run.
So, I'll now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-double-
digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate
hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in November. These will rebound sequentially driven by insurance
income improving due to seasonality, solid organic growth, and the full impact of the BenefitMall acquisition.
The extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity.
Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately 1% as the increased minimum wage, investments,
and revenue producing businesses and technology, and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost
savings.
Putting these pieces all together we expect adjusted PPNR to grow approximately 10% with some upside based
on the realization of investment banking pipelines. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter
expectations we're on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year.

We remain consistent with our expectations that the net charge-off ratio will be between 25 and 35 basis points
for the full year due to our performance year-to-date and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio.
With that I would turn it back to Bill to conclude.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, Mike. Continuing to our strategic shift on slide 18. Earlier this year, I expressed my view that
the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our third quarter results build upon the
second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall PPNR trajectory, progress is real and is
palpable. We've made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by our improving
mobile app ratings, and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments, and many other new features
and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients.
Speed to answering in our care centers is well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will
improve the efficiency as well. Loan production in the third quarter was the highest it's been at Truist, up 8%
compared to the second quarter. Branch loan and deposit production are up a solid 14% and 20% like quarter,
respectively as teammates become more confident with processes and systems, but also improved solutions and
capabilities.
IRM referrals to our wealth businesses increased 17% sequentially and the amount of income generated from
IRM referrals by our Commercial Community Bank was the second highest ever both highlighting the power of our
advice driven and client centric model. Our brand awareness was up almost 400 basis points in the third quarter
while our peers were flat to down. And our brand consideration, which measures whether consumers are giving
Truist a serious thought was 210 basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets having only been alive for
– that brand for three years.
Almost all of her client satisfaction scores are ascending, and in many cases at their highest level since we've
become Truist. The financial benefits of the momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as
market conditions normalize and merger-related expense noise abates.
To conclude, Truist is on the right path and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post
integration potential which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on slide 19. Strategically, we have
shifted from execution to execution, transformation, and growth. We're investing in digital and technology as we
reduce cost including operational losses. We're simplifying our processes and operations, and we are acting on
our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience.
We're also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue
synergy potential we have as its squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts in
activity do not require incremental risk appetite or capital, just execution and focus, both of which lie within the
sphere of control.
Externally, while we believe the economy is generally healthy, persistent high inflation, and a rapid tightening
monetary policy combined with geopolitical tensions have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move
into 2023.
Truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented
model for clients, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, and a strong capital position relative to our

risk profile, and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and

Good morning, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Bill, you mentioned that you guys had a positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of 260 basis points, can
you give us some color what you're thinking about positive – when you look at adjusted positive operating
leverage for the next 12 months, what do you think that could come in at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think we'll – obviously, for the balance of the year, we talked about this as well, that I think we'll have
positive operating leverage for the year. As we look into 2023, obviously, there are a lot of puts and takes, there's
a lot of uncertainty headed into that, but positive operating leverage is going to be a core tenet of what we do.
So if we look at the revenue potential in terms of the loan growth and deposit production we've had, being able to
capitalize on those opportunities with those clients as we move forward. So even if the economy slows down a bit,
we still have a lot of momentum in that area. We've got great strength in our insurance business, we've got great
strength in our overall capital markets business. Wealth has been building its capability. So, we've got a lot of
engines and tailwind from that side.
And then we've got a lot of tailwind on the cost saves. So we'll complete the bulk of the merger cost saves at the
end of this year, but heading into next year is really where we get to leverage all those. If you think about the
concept of you put two things together, now you make those two things more efficient. So those opportunities for

digitization and automation, we're consolidating our card platform, all the things that'll continue on in terms of cost
saves.
So I'm just – I don't like giving specific guidance on operating leverage for the year other than to say that will be a
core tenet and component of how we plan for the future.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as the follow-up question, you pointed out that the deposit beta was 21% on a cumulative
basis, and 14% without the brokered CDs, and that was below your models. Two things, can you tell us what your
model would've suggested the deposit beta would have been? And then second, using the forward curve, what do
you think you end up with the final cumulative deposit beta? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, good morning, Gerard, it's Mike. I'm happy to take that one. So, you're right, we've been very pleased by the
performance of the deposit portfolio so far at 21%. I think we said earlier this year, we expected the betas to be
closer to 30% as we get to the second half of the year. We still expect that to be the case by year-end.
In terms of a terminal beta very, very hard to tell. We've seen probably some lag given the rate at which rates
have increased, and so, we do expect there to be some catch-up, but whether or not it'll be to the tune of the
previous cycle in the mid-30s or beyond will be – we'll observe that together.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a question on funding and deposits. You guys are
showing fairly good resiliency as is the industry. Just give a little more context of what you're expecting to see in
terms of mix shift and also your thoughts, it looked like you did add a bunch of wholesale borrowings relative to
your incremental cost of funding through deposits. So just help us think about how you're thinking about liability
structure and deposit growth. Thanks.

Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Ken, good morning, it's Mike. I'll start here as well. Again, we have been very pleased from the deposit
perspective with only a sequential decrease of 1%. And so very pleased by how the balances are hanging in
there. We are expecting, I think, over the near term, to continue to have some pressure on deposits as well as

some pressure on mix. We did see some shift from DDA into interest-bearing, that's been a moderate shift so far,
and we're still well above levels that we experienced pre-COVID, but we are beginning to see that shift to take
place.
In terms of short-term borrowings, you're right, we are accessing brokered markets, we are accessing short-term
markets, and do expect that to continue over the intermediate term. But don't expect that to shift significantly. As
we think about funding, loan growth for one has been very, very high so far year-to-date. We do expect loan
growth to moderate somewhat, which should alleviate some of that gap. But between the deposit balance levels,
between leveraging some of the securities portfolio running off to the tune of $10 billion to $15 billion per year,
accessing some of the wholesale markets which is a pretty wide array of tools, and even thinking about the capital
markets, we feel really good about our funding capability.

Okay, understood. Yeah go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Maybe just to add to that in terms of the first part of the question too, is just the strength of our deposit
franchise, it's pretty granular, 42% under $250,000, we've got really good market share. But what we're seeing,
and I talked about this in my prepared comments, our production's really strong.
Truist One has been really successful. Our teammates have really responded. Clients and – both new clients and
existing clients have really responded. Investments in treasury and payments and – so we're leaning into this in
terms of our own capabilities from the deposit production side.
And then, for the fourth quarter, remember the third quarter has got some seasonality in things like public funds,
for example, where that's a strong area for us. So, I think we'll be sort of stable in the fourth quarter. And then,
Mike talked, I think, eloquently about the funding side.

Good morning, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Bill, you saw – NII saw a nice sequential growth, and its likely to continue to grow into 4Q given your outlook
plus the asset balance – asset sensitive balance sheet. So I guess, based on your comments to Gerard, of betas
in the mid-30s or maybe a little bit higher. Do you think you can continue to grow NII on a sequential basis as we
look ahead over the next few quarters adjusted for seasonal impacts, and maybe just talk about some of the puts
and takes involved in that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A

Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ryan, good morning, thanks for the question. You're right, I mean look, we've got really good trajectory
going into Q4 with NIM, as we mentioned in our guide, expected to increase 15 or so basis points. Look, as long
as rates continue to increase, we expect to continue to see some NIM expansion at some point. I think we all
expect to achieve this terminal policy rate and whether it's higher, longer or begins to decline we'll see.

From an NII perspective, we'll obviously benefit from that NIM expansion over that period. And then I think as
NIMs begin to feel some pressure, we feel good again. Today, we've got really nice earning asset growth, we
expect that to moderate but should offset any impact over the intermediate term of the decline in NIMs. We see
2023 from a rates perspective as a relatively stable period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:37:58) Mike's point. A lot of it all depends on loan growth. And what we see going into next
year, really positive momentum through this quarter, which I think will continue into the fourth quarter. It all gets a
little murkier as we head into next year. But I like the momentum, and the production, and the pipelines, and the
relevance, and the competitiveness of our franchise right now from that standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Bill, maybe a bigger picture question for me so, I think at a recent conference you highlighted that you
expected expenses to grow in 2023 which makes sense given you've done a handful of deals, there's pressure
from inflation. However, when we think back on the drivers of the merger, we were talking about best-in-class
growth, improving returns, and I know we've now made this shift to offense, but when I speak to investors I get the
sense, I feel we're not quite there yet.
Well I know you're not giving 2023 guidance. What do we need to see for this to begin to come through, whether
it's operating leverage, or better than peer expense growth. And just how are you measuring the success of all
these efforts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think overall, I've talked about this, it's the measurement of, can we grow revenue long-term, over time,
and PPNR faster and relative to our market opportunities. And I think that opportunity sits squarely in front of us. I
think if I look at the things that contribute to that and the areas of production like loan production, AUM production,
deposit production. I'd argue, actually, we're sort of getting to sort of a peak kind of performance in those areas.
As it relates to the expense side and this stuff just doesn't go quarter-to-quarter. You're just – they're going to
have different levels of investment. We've made a conscious decision and while I'll acknowledge I'm cranky on the
operating losses side so, operational losses. I think we've got some opportunity there. I see some improvements
coming, but that has been longer and – taken longer than I anticipated, but we're consciously investing in some
areas. So we're consciously investing in investment banking, and wealth, and insurance. And you know as well,
we got a good track record here. When times are a little bumpy and the opportunity is there we've taken
advantage of it and that's proven to be really, really smart investments on our standpoint.
So we're sort of unabashed about that and that has a quarter-to-quarter implication to it. And I just have to absorb
it and take it because I'm confident that we're doing the things that will create better opportunity for us and allow
us to gain share over time.
So, long answer to a short direct question. I think we can grow disproportionately over time. It just won't look like
that quarter-to-quarter, and I think, look at the production, look at the capabilities that we're creating today, and
I'm confident in manifesting those towards the future.

Hi, it's Betsy. How are you doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good, thank you. I wanted to just dig into a couple of things. One is on loan growth. It's been really strong and I
heard the comments around how you're funding it and how you're thinking about driving that from here. I wanted
to get a little bit of an understanding on how you're thinking about the quality of the book relative to its ability to
absorb this interest rate hike.
So obviously we've had about 300 basis points so far. We're going to get at least another 150-plus basis points
over the next quarter or so. And how are you assessing your borrowers' ability to pay back? Are you all too
worried about credit risk? I know you gave the guide for the full year NCOs which I'm wondering why not having –
have brought that down given the performance you had to date? So, just the few questions on credit from that
perspective. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll start, Betsy, if it's okay, I'll also turn it over to Clarke, he's itching to get in and talk about credit quality,
and the quality of our portfolio, and what we've put on the books. And we've not diminished our commitment to
credit quality. We're taking our clients through the appropriate stress testing process. I mean we're underwriting at
new rates and new environments. So, I think our production just reflects our just competitiveness.
I mean, our ability to win more size and relevance with our clients, and then you see that reflected right now in our
reserve, particularly on the wholesale side. The quality actually is, I might argue is [ph] might (00:42:55)
improving. So, Clarke, why don't you embellish that, if you would.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Yeah, thanks, Bill and I agree with you. We are very careful in our underwriting right now. So we're looking
obviously at rate shock and the ability to absorb that. We're looking at other things like pricing power and their
margins given supply and input cost, and inflation, looking at clients' investment decisions, how they are deploying
capital, their liquidity, their balance sheet, and just overall strength. So we feel really good about the core
underwriting fact I'd tell you for the quarter about 95% of our C&I production was investment grade or near
investment grade credit. So really high quality there.
And as far as our NCO guidance for the full year, we feel really good about where are, but do remember we
normalize as we go into the fourth quarter from the consumer standpoint and we have the seasonal impact. So
that's really, truly the consumer side that may increase [ph] also some (00:43:58).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, got it. And then just digging in a little bit on the commercial side on this theme. Can you remind us how you
are thinking about your insured national credit exposure, you know what that is, leverage lending I know, legacy,
SunTrust has a bigger skew in their business model to that, but with the combined organization it's been reduced
to bit as a percentage of total. So just give us a sense to how big those books are today? How they're trending?
And how much capacity you have to lean in with the bigger balance sheet you got now? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Clarke, you want to take it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Maybe I will start it, Bill. First, from a SNC standpoint, we're in really good shape. We just went through the
exam and had great results. I feel very good about that.
We have about $59 billion in outstandings in our SNC books. So it's about 19% of our balances, and it has been
fairly steady or so. So it's a very diversified book. We feel really good about that. As far as our leverage finance
book, just remember that's about 7% of our total book, however, over half of that is 55% investment grade clients.
So really 3% would be more in the sponsored or non-investment grade side.
That book is performing extremely well today, so minimal NPLs. We've had about 9 basis points of losses and our
criticized are in good shape. So while there's been disruption and challenges in the market, our overall
performance has been very, very good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I think you characterized it right, but part of the benefits of the merger is the diversification of that portfolio by
definition of the denominator. So we haven't grown it in proportion to the increase in the size of our business. And
it's a well-diversified leverage portfolio, it's a well-diversified exposures are not significant to any one person, and
it's about 50% sponsors and about 50% on us. So this is a business that supports our client base, and it's
categorized as leveraged, but it's really supporting the growth in our client base and consistent with our strategy
of helping our clients with their business lifecycle. So it's a little bit different and a little bit more focused on us
component.

Operator: Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo will have our next question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, can you hear me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I'll continue my analogy with your franchise [indiscernible] (00:46:44) I mean clearly in the country's sweet spot for
population growth. I mean I keep meeting more of investing clients that have moved to New York – to Florida
permanently entire firms, and so you're certainly in the sweet spot.
You did mention momentum, and certainly NII, and loan growth, and how you're going from defense to offense, so
I get it, but then I hear, Bill, your target for positive operating leverage of over 0%. It just seems like with the target
like that you're aiming for the Charlotte Motor Speedway instead of Indianapolis 500. Right, and it seems like –
and this is at a time when your peers are showing much greater positive operating leverage, and they don't have
this unique in-market merger with these incredible synergies that are possible. So I know you're not giving too
much guidance for next year right now, but can you just talk about whatever headwinds may be going away.
You talked about the operational losses. It seems like you're doing a lot for your customers, you're making [ph]
them whole (00:47:52) more than others perhaps, you're doing a lot for your employees, you're raising what they
get paid, but I'm just thinking about the shareholders here. And so what are some of the headwinds that may or
may not go away, and what are some of the tailwinds that you think we'll see more of?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, thanks, Mike. And we'll continue to keep the [indiscernible] (00:48:18) I guess, but if we define speed as
related to how are you doing against your markets, I look at the loan deposit, AUM, the production side, I'd say we
actually had a really good high rate of speed. And I'd say we're at a speed that reflects the opportunity that sits in
our market. So if we define it that way. If we define the opportunity, which I 100% agree with, is to have better
improved positive operating leverage over time, and increased revenue and PPNR growth, we also have to invest
to make that happen.
So we, like you, see the same things that you're seeing in our markets and we got to make sure that we invest in
those. And again, I wish it sort of balanced out quarter-to-quarter. It just doesn't. So the opportunity is for us to
invest right now, and I'd say gain share long term in areas I mentioned before, like investment banking, like
insurance, and like wealth, we're just going to do that. And I think that's going to have a good long-term impact for

us. You've seen this before, you've seen this movie, and you know how well it ends for us. So we know how to do
this. So I'm very confident on that side.
And then the part about operational losses and the commitments that we made to our clients, those are also good
long-term decisions. I mean, look, we were in the middle of a merger. We gave the benefit of doubt to a client
whenever there was a benefit of a doubt. I think, long term, that's going to create sustainable long-term
relationships. And the same thing with teammates, increasing minimum wage is fantastic for shareholders. I cited
some of the stats that we're seeing already in improved turnover and improved vacancy rates. I didn't mention the
care center, we're seeing that as well. So long term, that's going to have a tremendous benefit for our
shareholders as well as our teammates.
So I'm confident I think we're materializing the things that we want to have, it's just not coming in quarter-to-
quarter as I'd like, it's not as matched as I'd like. There are some pesky things that I think will come down and I'm
already seeing that at the end of the quarter and the first of this quarter in terms of operational losses. So we can
have a cleaner, more focused, easier to understand, and easier to have the production and those things result in
the kind of PPNR growth that I think we're able to do long term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, a follow-up. Even if I can see the speed part, I guess the cost of gas is quite high. And maybe Mike, from your
perspective, coming into the CFO spot, things that you might be able to do to control the expenses as Bill was
alluding to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. I think, first and foremost, still at this point absorbing, and
coming in and meeting the team, getting a sense for where we are. Look, Bill made some great points, I don't
come to the table with some predefined view or silver bullet as it relates to these things. The headwinds that Bill
talked about, minimum wage, inflation, some of the investments that we're prioritizing, they're important, but then
again, we have some great tailwinds as well, whether it be realizing the benefits of the savings. I think there's
some benefit from an automation perspective, some work we're doing that's in more nascent phase, and then just
overall productivity.
I mean, and look, if, if – I think we've got great track record in terms of being able to manage expense if and when
that becomes a more important priority based on market conditions, but no, I think Bill said it well, Mike.

Hey, good morning. I guess one follow-up first for Clarke on the reserves. And Clarke, apologies if I missed it. But
can you remind us; what's the base case for the weighted unemployment rate that's baked into your reserving at

the end of the quarter. And I guess, as we think about sort of what the next 12 months could look like, what are
the other one or two big inputs that could change the reserving outlook other than unemployment? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
That's a great question. Our base case, which we weight at 40%, we have unemployment going up to 4%, and
then going higher into the mid-4s as we go into 2023 and beyond. So clearly, a little more pessimistic as we ran
the reserves this quarter. I would say, for us, other big drivers would be a housing HPI would be another input
there in our models, and you've already mentioned GDP.
So from our standpoint, the big driver for us would be the scenario weighting and the scenario outlook would have
the biggest impact on our reserves, obviously, versus other things like our mix production and overall portfolio
performance. But right now, I think the scenario outlook would be the biggest driver.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just one follow-up, Bill, for you, as we look at the next stage, I mean, obviously, BB&T,
SunTrust, history of acquisitions, a lot of your peers might be struggling in terms of deposit, deposit pricing given
what the Fed might be doing. Talk to us in terms of as we look forward the next year or two, appetite for bank
M&A, extending the franchise, and how you think about that.

Good morning. Can you guys talk about the openness to maybe some restructuring of the securities portfolio,
obviously, rates have gone up a lot and the yields on your current book are a lot lower. So, it will cost a lot to
restructure a big part of it, but there might be some opportunities here and there as you think about the strong
capital generation and what to use capital for?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A

Yeah, hey Matt, it's Mike. Good morning and happy to react to that. As of this moment, there are no plans to
restructure those securities portfolio. I think I mentioned that we do view the portfolio as a tool for funding loan
growth as that continues, it's creating cash flow of approximately $10 million to $15 million per year.

Yeah, and Matt, I mean, today we're redeploying it into the growth in our business and you acknowledge that
would be very expensive and what we try to do is look at that securities portfolio over time. And so we're going to
take that cash flow and right now we've got great opportunities to reinvest it, and not take a capital hit for the

Okay and then just separately, you mentioned earlier some mix shift out of auto and mortgage, can you frame

Yeah, Matt just basically, sort of, an overall return focused, and make sure that we're maximizing our capital as
we see some of the returns, and the mortgage business, and the auto business being a little bit more stressed.
We want to make sure, we're serving our clients and we're doing a great job in doing that. But by the same token,
we're seeing the other opportunities in our commercial portfolio and our consumer portfolio. So we just want to get
the right balance and a return focus versus we've never been sort of the growth for growth sake. We want to be
return-oriented, I want to maximize the return on the capital that we're investing in the portfolio.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey Erika.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just – I had one follow-up question, Bill, you got asked this several times, but I just wanted to make sure your
shareholders understood what you're saying. You've been asked a lot about delivering operating leverage, at the
same time dislocation creates opportunity, and this is also a, sort of, once in a cycle help from rates right in terms
of operating leverage getting help – helping the denominator.
So, is the message here really like that you are going to always try to deliver positive operating leverage as a way
of Truist's life, but you are seeing opportunities to invest today, and as we think about the tougher part of the cycle
whether we fall into recession next year, and we don't have rate hikes helping, your investments today are going
to help Truist deliver above average PPNR over a longer period of time other than just now when you're getting a
lot of help from rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I think that's really well stated, and I wish I had stated it as well as your question. So, no I think that's exactly right,
and as I mentioned, I mean, positive operating leverage will be a hallmark of what we do. So that is, that's core
and focus of what we do. We just can't be wed to that quarter-to-quarter when we see an opportunity.
So we're going to have positive operating leverage this year. It'll be a little less than we'd hoped for six months
ago, but we're investing and I think it's going to create not only better operating leverage, but more importantly,
strong PPNR growth for the future. And we just have to make sure that we're, for the benefit of our shareholders,
thinking long term, and thinking about this incredible opportunity that sits in front of us, and maximizing our ability
to capitalize on it. So, I think you stated it actually quite well.

Got it. And my last question is for Clarke. Thank you, so much for sharing that data on your ACL. And just in
terms of how CECL works, if we do hit a 4% unemployment rate which is your base case, does that mean that
you have to then weight worst scenarios in that 4%. In other words, do you say okay we hit 4% that's our base
case, we don't have to build reserves further, or does that model say, oh we're at 4%, it could get worse, so we
now need to build for something worse than 4%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great question Erika, I would say, keep in mind we've run multiple scenarios, so we have our base case, which I
described. We also run a much more severe set of downside scenarios. And as we look forward, those scenarios
get worse as well even if the baseline deteriorates some additionally. So we weighed all of that, and we look at it

each quarter. And so even if the baseline is at one place, the downside scenarios maybe more and would be
more severe.
So, we're going to look at all of that and decide how we weight all of those factors in determining the allowance,
and so yes, I mean the downside scenario could push it even further, even if the baseline is going up.
