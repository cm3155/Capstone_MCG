Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly highlight the fourth quarter and the full year financial
results, and then focus most of my comments highlighting the progress we made in 2019, as well as outlining our
priorities for 2020.
Mike will then go through the financials in much more detail. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.4
billion and earnings per share of $1.52. This includes a positive impact of $0.50 per share from notable items,
which Mike will discuss.
For the full year on an adjusted basis EPS of $4.02 on revenues of $15.7 billion, full year expenses were down
slightly, as we identified and implemented efficiencies, to more than offset the increase in technology investments.
What that means is we actually delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of real productivity. And we had solid
operating margins of approximately 32%. We generated over $5 billion of capital in 2019, returning more than
100% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while at the same time, maintaining a strong
capital position, investing for growth and achieving a solid return on tangible common equity of greater than 20%.
This year was not without its challenges however. And notably those included interest rate cuts in the US. And
while some equity markets hit new highs, client activity levels were constrained in many of our business.
Despite this fees in Investment Services were resilient and we saw some modest organic revenue growth. We
also delivered strong operating margins and capital returns for our shareholders. We built a solid foundation in
2019, including substantial investment in technology and talent, while operations executed a significant number of
strategic programs in 2019 that will drive efficiency, reduce risk, and enhance the client experience.
Looking at our progress across our business portfolio, let's start with Asset Servicing. We're taking action to
ensure we consistently provide excellent service quality. The pipeline is growing. And we announced important
new wins in 2019, across different geographies in both asset owner and asset manager segments.
We created some exciting partnerships with leading front office system providers, namely Aladdin, Bloomberg and
most recently SimCorp. And these will provide our clients with open architecture that gives them choice and
flexibility. While still early these partnerships are strengthening our offering and they're helping us win new
business.
We enhanced our capabilities in alternatives and ETFs, which have strong growth prospects and we're expanding
the range of data and analytical applications available to our clients where our strong position in data
management, accounting, performance and distribution analytics position us deepen our relationships.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
We've made good progress in monitoring and measuring client relationships and improving the quality of work
and services we provide day-in and day-out for our clients. This is already driving improved client satisfaction and
lower attrition rates.
In Pershing, we are seeing fee growth coming through and are excited about the future to this business. The
industry is evolving and we are confident that our market leadership and strategy will position us well going
forward. We ended the year with the strongest pipeline in many years with both institutional broker-dealers and in
the RIA space. We continue to onboard these new clients each quarter and to build the future pipeline.
Across the industry consolidation is helping make Pershing's open architecture increasingly attractive to our
clients. We're accelerating investments in the advisory segment, strengthening market leadership in the broker-
dealer segment and continuing the development of front-end technology including integration with third-party
providers to deliver state-of-the-art experiences and analytics to advisors and their investors. All of these are
making us an even better partner to our clients.
In Clearance and Collateral Management where we are the clear leader, we delivered strong financial
performance in 2019. We saw organic fee growth over the course of the year driven by existing clients and new
business, as well as clients on-boarded in 2018 who increased their business with us. We see continued growth
opportunity in this business from structural and regulatory changes, the provision of services to bilateral repos and
from modernizing our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move their collateral globally.
We're enhancing our platform to allow clients to have access to more real-time data and self-service tools. We
also continue to automate manual processes to reduce risk and improve operational efficiencies. And we are
improving the client experience by introducing new digitally enhanced capabilities.
In Issuer Services, we're building out capabilities which is broadening our relationships. We gained market share
in Corporate Trust and drove new business across a number of our key products such as structured and muni
debt, as well as insurance-linked securities.
Our ongoing rollout of the new loan servicing platform is enabling us to be more responsive to our clients and
deliver them more functionality. We're investing in automating capabilities and digitizing workflow tools to offer
clients simplified access to services and data to help them minimize risk, increase control and gain efficiency.
Our Treasury Service business has scale and a reputation for excellent service and relationship coverage, which
are the result of the investments we've made in talent and our product offering. With over $2 trillion of institutional
payments per day, we are a very meaningful partner to our clients.
In 2019, we successfully refocused on higher-margin businesses such as liquidity and payments. Our deposit
initiative grew high-quality stable balances by around 18% in 2019. Our technology investments in Treasury
Services have been centered on advancements in real-time solutions and operational efficiency to increase
straight-through processing rates, both of which further enhance the client experience.
In Asset Management, the financial results were negatively impacted by outflows over the last year. Performance,
however, has been solid across many of the largest strategies, including equities and multi-asset classes. That,
combined with the investment in new products across the platform, is helping to improve the pipeline. We have
seen improved performance in Newton, Walter Scott and Alcentra and we continue to believe that there is an
important role for active strategies, including LDI going forward.

Our Wealth Management business will benefit over the long term from our increased investments, as well as
strong leadership. We're expanding our sales force, strengthening our banking and investment product set, and
delivering digital tools to benefit both our advisors and clients, and create a leading experience.
Now overarching all of our businesses is our consistent investment in technology. Our technology priorities center
on improving quality, developing innovative products and services and enhancing efficiency for our clients, which
in turn creates cost savings for us as well as for them. We are transforming our infrastructure and expanding our
data and analytics solutions and the use of APIs to continue to create an open platform. We're deploying artificial
intelligence and machine learning to simplify processes and proactively deliver additional insights to clients, such
as improved analytics to increase distribution of their own products.
We're embracing partnerships. In November, for example, we hosted a well-received inaugural Fintech Connect
conference. We recently announced new collaborations with a number of fintechs to expand our capabilities,
including one this week that will enable us to deliver a new suite of oversight and contingent net asset value
calculation solutions for clients. This is just the beginning.
In operations, we have numerous initiatives in flight across the businesses that are already yielding efficiencies
that we are able to reinvest to support new business initiatives and further efficiency and automation efforts. For
example, in corporate action elections, increased automation has significantly reduced the number of transactions
that we process manually, while offering our clients best-in-class cut-off times.
In the payments space, we continue to enhance our straight-through processing rate. We reached a record 97%
in the month of December, that's up from 94% a year ago. And in fund accounting, we've deployed self-service
capabilities for reporting when we've automated over 2,000 client reports.
One of the recently announced partnerships enabling us to launch an AI-based reconciliation and data control
solution into better serving our clients' complex data needs. Other partnerships are helping us do things such as
re-imagine the billing process and employ AI to resolve client inquiries faster.
Across the company, we've been disciplined about the investments we're making, and are focused on driving
efficiency in our technology spend. As an example, we're simplifying our infrastructure and we're reducing the
number of applications, which are now down 10% over the past 18 months or so. In the next 12 months, it will be
reduced by another 10%-plus, so a total reduction of 20%-plus in applications over a two to three year period.
So, to summarize 2019, while we have more work to do, we're on the right path. We're beginning to see the
benefits of the investments made over recent years and will continue to invest, and we've made progress on a
host of initiatives while maintaining strong operating margins and capital returns.
As we look to 2020, our priorities are unchanged. They are centered on, one, driving sustainable revenue growth
through a strong performance culture focused on improving service quality, as well as fostering faster innovation.
Two, improving every aspect that we can within our operations; maintaining our investment in technology is key to
this. Our overall technology spend for 2020 is expected to exceed the $3 billion we spent in 2019. Three, we're
continuing to drive efficiency throughout the organization through automation as well as good expense discipline.
And four, ensuring we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders.
In closing, we are confident in our plans and our ability to execute on them, while always looking for opportunities
to improve. We have a great team and a great foundation and we are excited about the future prospects for the
firm.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to review the financial results in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.
Beginning on page 4, the financial highlights document. In the final quarter of 2019, net earnings of $1.4 billion
and earnings per share of $1.52 in both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items.
The notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018 were costs related to severance, the relocation of our corporate
headquarters and litigation expenses, partially offset by some tax adjustments, reducing our earnings by $0.16
per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2018, we benefited by $0.50 per share from the gain on sale of an equity
investment, partially offset by severance, net securities losses and litigation expenses.
Total revenue was $4.8 billion. Fee revenue increased 26% with nearly all of that from the gain on the sale of the
equity investment. Underlying that, Investment Services fees were up. Foreign exchange and other trading was
down. And most other line items were relatively flat.
Net interest revenue declined 8% to $815 million. Expenses were down slightly but, excluding the notable items,
were up 2%, with the increase driven by technology. We generated $1.4 billion in net income applicable to
common shareholders, or $931 million excluding the notable items.
We continue to have a strong return on tangible common equity and maintain a solid pre-tax margin. In terms of
shareholder capital returns, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares for just over $1 billion and paid $286
million in dividends in the fourth quarter. We've reduced the number of shares outstanding by a little over 6%
since the beginning of 2019. For the full year of 2019, we returned $4.4 billion to common shareholders, which is
over 100% of earnings, through $3.3 billion of share repurchases and approximately $1.1 billion in dividends.
Moving now to capital and liquidity on page 6. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. All of our key ratios
were strengthened since the third quarter. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at the end of the
year and our CET1 ratio was 11.5% under the advanced approach. Our average LCR in the fourth quarter was
120%. And our SLR was 6.1%. Including the impact of the recent change to the rule, our SLR would have been
approximately 120 basis points higher.
Turning to page 7. My comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue
was $815 million, up almost 2% versus the lease adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter. As we have
mentioned previously, we have been focused on growing and optimizing our deposit base for the last 18 months
or so. For example, we've been working with Wealth Management clients to convert their cash from off-balance
sheet investments to on-balance sheet deposits. Our sales teams have been focused on attracting additional
client deposits and other businesses. And we've been targeting escrow and other opportunities while being
disciplined about pricing. All of these initiatives and some of the macro factors contributed to the result. The
activity that drove the outperformance versus our expectations came in the last few weeks of the year and some
of it was episodic.
Now as you look at the drivers, both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits increased across our
businesses. Some of the noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits related to some targeted activity
including episodic corporate actions and other activities, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. Margin and non-

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
margin loans in our securities portfolio balance increased modestly. The loan balances were driven by increased
client demand.
The yield on interest-earning assets continued to decline as expected, due to the decline in short-term rates as
the Fed cut rates at the end of the third quarter and again in October. The increase in intermediate and long-term
interest rates is helpful but the overall yield on the securities portfolio, loans and other interest-earning assets
declined, the short-term rates had a bigger impact sequentially. We also made minor adjustments to our securities
portfolio that should modestly enhance the yields going forward. The reduction in asset yields was partially offset
by lower deposit rates and other funding costs.
Lastly, at the end of December, we did benefit modestly from higher spreads and activity levels [indiscernible]
(17:33) retail business and from the money we deployed in reverse repo at year-end. Although repo rate over
year-end ultimately normalized, we were able to lock in some trades when reverse repos were between 3% and
4%. We don't expect year-end pricing to repeat again in Q1.
All of this activity resulted in our net interest margin remaining flat at 109 basis points versus the lease adjusted
NIM in the third quarter. As we've said in the past, we're focused on driving higher net interest revenue and we
will continue to take advantage of low risk opportunities even if they're not NIM accretive.
Page 8 gives you some more detail about the drivers of the net interest revenue increase versus the third quarter.
We can see how the increased client deposit volumes, higher interest-earning assets and lower funding costs
benefited our net interest revenue. This more than offset the decline in interest-earning asset yields.
Page 9 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $3 billion were down slightly. The decrease is
mostly due to the impact of expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters in the fourth quarter of
2018 and lower litigations. And excluding notable items, expenses were up 2%, primarily reflecting the continued
investments in technology.
Turning to page 10. Total Investment Services revenue was down 2%. Assets under custody and/or
administration increased 12% year-over-year to $37.1 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and client
inflows. Although the higher market levels were a bigger driver, we did see good organic AUC/A growth
throughout the course of the year.
Within Asset Servicing, revenue was down 3% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and
volatility impacting foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets. Asset
Servicing fees in this business were up slightly. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 7% due to
lower foreign exchange volatility and volumes. The pipeline continues to remain healthy, dialogue with clients
remains active and we're not seeing an acceleration in pricing pressure.
In Pershing, total revenue was up 2% to $570 million. Clearing fees were up 6%, reflecting growth in client assets
and accounts from new business on-boarded and from existing clients, which was partially offset by lower net
interest revenue.
Issuer Services was down 6% to $415 million on lower Depositary Receipts revenue, which was partially offset by
higher client activity in Corporate Trust. The decline in Depositary Receipts revenue was due to the timing of fees
and cross-border settlement activity as well as lower net interest revenue.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Treasury Services revenue was flat at $329 million as higher client activity and payment fees were offset by lower
net interest revenue. Fees were up 6%. Sequentially, Treasury Services revenue was up 5% driven by higher net
interest revenue.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 1% to $280 million, reflecting growth in collateral
management and clearance volumes, which were mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. Average tri-party
collateral management balances were up 12%.
Page 11 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our
Investment Services business.
Now turning to page 12 for Investment Management. Total Investment Management revenue was up 1%. Asset
Management revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $688 million, primarily reflecting higher market values and the
impact of hedging activities partially offset by the cumulative AUM outflow since the third quarter of 2018.
Performance fees of $48 million were down from the fourth quarter of 2018, which was one of our stronger
quarters in a while. We had outflows of $13 billion in the quarter. And overall assets under management of $1.9
trillion were up 11% year-over-year, due to higher markets and the favorable impact of the weaker US dollar,
partially offset by net outflows. The sequential market impact is negative, due to lower UK fixed income market
values, which more than offset the impact of the increased equity market values and managed assets.
Wealth Management revenue was down 5% year-over-year to $287 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest
revenue partially offset by slightly higher fees that benefited from higher market values and client assets grew
11% year-on-year.
Turning to our Other segment on page 13, total revenue increased reflecting the previously referenced gain on
sales of the equity investment, partially offset by the net securities losses that were due to a small portfolio
rebalancing.
Now before we open it to questions, I'll spend just a few minutes on how we're thinking about the first quarter in
2020. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue in the third quarter was better than expected in part due to
some episodic balances. So at this point in the quarter, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit
volumes are lower than the elevated levels in December. We expect that the yields on our securities portfolio will
continue to going down with lower [ph] reinvestment (22:57) yields. And, therefore, we expect net interest revenue
to be down a little less than 5% sequentially in the first quarter.
We expect that net interest revenue would stabilize later in the year if the forward curves remain stable and
steepen a little, the mix of deposits don't change significantly and as the impact of lower rates on the balance
sheet become more fully incorporated into the results. And just a reminder that approximately 30% of the
securities portfolio re-prices each quarter. We will continue to actively focus on growing deposits, optimizing the
mix between on-and off-balance sheet offerings and being disciplined about pricing.
The Fed actions to increase excess reserve should be helpful as they've been historically correlated to the level of
our deposits. Just to keep in mind that the relationship may not hold in the short run or in any given quarter. We
would expect that investment and other income would be between $25 million to $35 million per quarter for the
year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
With regard to expenses, Todd spoke about the importance of consistently investing in technology. We expect
that the level of technology investment will be up from 2019. We can calibrate the pace of that investment if we
need to. This will lead our overall expenses for the full year of 2020 to increase by up to 2% year-on-year,
excluding the notable items. Included is approximately 50 basis point impact from accounting related to higher
pension expense.
Now keep in mind that the charge we took in the fourth quarter for severance reflects the actions that will take
place over the year, so we won't see the full run rate impact until 2021. And note that in the first quarter, staff
expenses will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for the retirement
eligible employees, the impact of which will be similar to last year and will affect sequential expense growth.
At this point, we currently expect the full year 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. And lastly, on the
regulatory front, we are quickly entering this year's CCAR process and are awaiting next steps in the capital
reform proposals. We continue to be encouraged by the direction of the proposals being discussed, but we'll all
see the final outcome and impact when they are complete.
With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions?

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just maybe just back on the expenses real quick, if you – I didn't see it in the
press release the bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter. And then as we think about
the expense trajectory into 2020 and even 2021, can you just talk about the investments in technology and how
you expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple years?

Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, hey, Brian, this is Mike. On the first piece; we didn't disclose the exact number and the split between the
two. I think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff expense
and the difference versus the third quarter. So, that will probably give you a good sense of the magnitude there.
The bigger piece by far was severance in the number. As you think about overall expenses, as both Todd and I
mentioned, we would expect to continue to invest even more this year than we did in 2019.
And really it's across a range of items both continuing to build out our – the infrastructure that is important for
operating our businesses. We're building new capabilities and you're seeing some of those get announced and
released even over the last couple weeks. And then there's a large chunk that's going into the efficiency agenda
on the cost side as you suggested there.

And I think working with Lester Owens, our Head of Operations, we've got a very long list of those programs that
we're just clicking down the list and executing. And as you can imagine, the benefits of those continue to come in
the P&L over a period of time. So, we'll get some of them in 2020 and we'll get some of them as we exit 2020 into
2021. And I'll just reinforce what Todd said in his remarks. You can see the benefits of those investments and
efficiency agenda coming through the P&L already, as we've increased the technology spend significantly in 2019
and overall expenses are down. And that's a result of that focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just
given the way the markets have moved in DARTs and the online brokerage industry at least had been pretty
strong, if you want to just – I would have expected that line to be a little stronger in the fourth quarter on a
sequential basis, if there's anything that you can call out would maybe depress that. And then maybe longer term,
you talked about within Pershing, in your RIA strategy, maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up
market share given the industry consolidation that's upon us here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. I'll take some of it. In terms of the – yeah, why don't I take the second piece – in terms of the industry
consolidation and how we kind of look at that, I mean we're a little different because Pershing is more B2B and we
serve broker-dealers and corporate IRAs. And we've also kind of differentiated ourselves because we provided
choice, whether that's related to the open investment platform that we've got or the ability to integrate best-in-
class kind of front office system. So, our clients have the choice as far as that goes. And I think that will, in the
long term, be the preference.
Right now the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity. What I mean by that's just the
consolidation. Probably as we look at it makes it more of an opportunity. There's a lot of interest in alternative
providers and that just puts us in a better position. As to the revenue growth, I think we're seeing some pretty
decent positives there as we have won some meaningful new business that we are implementing. Mike, I don't
know if you have any...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah and I would just – again, Brian, on our revenue stream, we're not a commission-based revenue stream. And
so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based on the number of
transactions that are getting executed. It's actually a very small piece of the puzzle there. So, you won't see the
same correlation between transaction activity in our revenue stream as you might with some of the online brokers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
But we've got a pretty strong pipeline there. We continue to win new business. We are differentiated on the
institutional side with some of our capabilities. And we're investing on the advisor side both in the sales as well as
the – the sales team, the branding as well as the technology that we're deploying. So, we feel pretty good about
the business.

to an expense growth of 2% or less. So, is the expectation that you're going to be able to deliver operating
leverage and therefore you expect there to be a revenue growth picture that's going to be at least 2% maybe a
little greater? And can you help us understand why there's such a big delay on the severance benefit? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Brennan. I'll take the start of that and then Mike can provide a little more color. In terms of the
environment delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as much as
anything right now, as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have longer term
benefits to us. So, I think it would be – it's certainly not impossible but challenged in the very near term. [ph] I
don't know if, Mike... (31:51)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look – and I do think, though, Brennan, once you get through the NIR stabilization, we feel very confident
still in the model where a little bit of revenue growth drives a significant amount of earnings growth. And so we
think that's still – we feel very confident that that still holds. And once NIR stabilize, which as I mentioned we think
under the assumptions I gave you, we think that happens later this year, then you should start to see some of that
come back into the picture.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. That's fair. And on that point, Mike, there was some encouraging signs here on the noninterest-bearing
deposits. Can you talk a little bit, give us a little more color on trends there in that line this quarter? And how
sustainable should we – I know you – I think you said that they're down from December levels, which is probably
pretty seasonally typical, but like with the interest rates coming down in the market, are those trends now like
more durable, some stability there and maybe even some growth, and do you have some deposit efforts
specifically intended to help support growth in that line as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look – I think I'll start on the last piece and try and make sure I hit all your points, but we've been – as I
said in my script, we've been focused on this for a while now. And that includes going after opportunities where
there's noninterest-bearing deposits. And part of the episodic activity that we saw in the fourth quarter was very
targeted activity that we go after related to escrow, as an example, where there's some significant transactions
there. It's hard to predict when they're going to come and how they're going to come, but it's an intentional act on
our part to go out and target those opportunities.

As you think about the path forward, I think the macro environment certainly should be helpful and we're
encouraged by the level of dialogue and the activity we're seeing. And we'll have to let it play out a little bit longer
to call a sustainable trend I think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. And you guys have picked up on the correlation to the Fed's balance sheet and the impact that it's likely to
have on us and that could be somewhat on the positive. And then the rest of it is going to be also rate driven. So if
there's a change in the rate environment, it could potentially move in that category as well.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Todd at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth. I wondered if you
could give us a sense as to what is the most important one or two areas that you're looking for to deliver growth
this year. And I'm asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend and where it's
most critical for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Well, I think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board. So we're spending – Mike talked a
little bit about just building a stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency, which just provides an increase in
the quality of our services. We are investing in integrating third-party capabilities, which I think is a bit of a
differentiator. We are investing in improving operations and we're starting to see the positive feedback from that
and the scorecards that our clients keep on us. The most important thing is to retain business and by providing
great service and covering – and increasingly better capabilities around that service, it's difficult for clients to
leave.
In terms of initiatives that might drive future revenue, so really kind of three or four areas where I'm most focused.
One is the things that we've talked about in the Clearing and Collateral Management [Clearance and Collateral
Management]. So, we are building an interoperable tri-party system, which we think will make our clients much

more effective in managing their collateral globally. And as a result, we can pick up some of the global market
share and also provide some of those services to those traditionally [ph] who've been in the buy lot (36:24) space.
That's all – that's probably another year or two before I think that really – that kicks in. But we're starting to see
some of the benefits from that now.
One of our other focus area is around data and analytics. And I think this is going to be an increasingly
competitive advantage for us as we build – we currently with the – under Eagle have approximately $24 trillion of
assets under management. Eagle is the other brand name of our data and analytics capability. As we've built on
that platform and what we call the Data Vault, we think we've got an exciting capability where we will see growth
this year. And will provide the ability to do – for our clients to do deep analysis around the structured data that's on
our platform. We're investing in our Wealth Management platform, that's more long-term as well and we've
already talked a little bit about the investments that we're making at Pershing. So I'd say those four are – in terms
of business growth are where my key focus is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's help...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, no, I think – I think I'd echo what Todd said on the bigger priorities. But I think the good part is that each of
the business – we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow. Some of them
require a bigger investment, some of them require smaller investment and so I think we're focused really on each
of them to make sure we get – we take advantage of those opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then Mike for you specifically or Todd can chime in too. But on the capital you highlighted that
the SLR under the new rule will be up, I think to what 7.3% or 7.2% or something like that. I know I've asked in
this call many times about press and what your intentions are there. Now that we have the final rule set in, maybe
you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital efficient there and not sure if it
has to wait until the CCAR given where the SLR came in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah look, I think SLR, as you know, Betsy, is one piece of the puzzle, in terms of the rules that are being
discussed and contemplated. And so I think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still a work in
process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete picture on how
we're going to optimize the capital stack.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. And is it better to do a call of the [ph] prep (39:08) or is it better to utilize the full capital stack you have in
increasing the balance sheet size for example for sponsored repo?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, for sponsored repo that doesn't have any impact on the size of our balance sheet. And so to take advantage
of opportunities like that we don't need to – we don't need capital to do that.

So I think – look, I think we're going – we're going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is
on the revenue side to grow and keep the balance sheet where it is or grow the balance sheet. And we're going to
look at our opportunities given the new capital rules. And I think you'll hear more from us on that as CCAR and
stress capital stuff comes into focus, hopefully over the next few months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, it's a – it's a little bit challenging, because we just don't know exactly what the rules are going to be. We do
lots of different things and we obviously follow all discussions. But at this point, we just don't have enough
precision to say what the actual impact is going to be to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Michael Santomassimo A

ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. So just a couple follow-ups. So one, I guess, on expenses. Mike, maybe, just to
clarify the base for what you guys are talking about 2020 expense growth is about $10.8 billion, kind of the core
number that you reported in 2019?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. It's what's in the press release on page 3.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. And then when you talk about the tech spend, you guys had $3 billion or so in 2019. I just want to make
sure is that all running through the income statement and again sounded like that was a 10% growth in 2019. How
much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for 2020? Basically just kind of trying to get a flavor for
how much you need to re-engineer in savings to keep the overall expenses below the 2% range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think look most of it's running through the P&L already Alex, so – for 2019. So, most of it's going through
the P&L. So, I think we're not – I don't think we've given you the exact percentage increase that's going to go up.
But we're continuing to deliver consistent efficiency gains as we go.
And as you and I and others have talked about over time, like we still think there's a long road ahead of
efficiencies that we can generate through these investments, we're making. So, we feel pretty confident that we're
going to be able to get at those over the next couple of years.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
All right. And my second question around the Asset Management business. So, when I look at the flow dynamics,
fixed income, LDI was a little light this quarter again, despite what has been a really strong trend in the industry.
And then, cash management also I think had some outflows.
Can you provide a little bit of color, kind of, what's been driving that? And then – the market performance also a
sizably negative number, which obviously is surprising, given what the market has done, so maybe kind of help
flush out what's driven both the flows and the market delta this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think on LDI, it's not going to be a straight line up, as you think about flows in that business. And there's
been lots happening in the UK pension market that – made people make sure they were thinking about how to
manage their liabilities in the right way.
And we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that we've got in that business in
the UK, plus they've been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside of that – of their core market.
So, I think we still feel good about the LDI space. We feel good about what they're doing. Performance has been
good. And so, we don't really have any concerns in the LDI space really at all. And as you know just more broadly
about our Asset Management business it's largely institutional set of clients. And so, you're going to have some
chunky flows from time to time for various reasons as you look at any given quarter. And so, there's nothing
underneath the fixed income side that I would point to that is a core issue or core trend that we're concerned
about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, then you had also had a question around market. I think one of the things to keep in mind, we have a fairly
substantial exposure to the UK where the currency impacts and the equity impacts are a little bit different than it
would have been domestically. So, that's one thing I was drawing there. In terms of the cash I would say that's a
little disappointing, and I think we need to work to do a little better there.

a long runway to deposit optimization from here?

Yes, I think, Brian it's – we're continuing to optimize. So, I think the – this is a dialogue that is a very granular
conversation with clients. And it's a client-by-client dialogue. And so, I think, we've made some progress, but
we've got more to go to continue to make sure that we're optimizing the pricing and footprint we've got there. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, is there any way [ph] you can give an (45:49) update on how the Aladdin offering is
moving forward? There's still some concern across the industry whether or not proprietary versus third-party
solutions is the way it's moving. Do you have any update there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. We've been building on a number of partnerships over the past six to nine months. And I'd say they're really
coming in two flavors. The first is where – is the ones that you're referring to is where we've connected with some
of the leading order management systems, Aladdin, Bloomberg and SimCorp. Many of our mutual clients already
have signed up and many are in the process of signing up. So, we've got a very high success rate where we've
got common clients. The other thing that it's doing for us is its opening doors for other conversations where we
see our clients able to gain efficiencies because of this.
So, I think right now the benefits that we're seeing is it's initiating discussions, opening doors and giving us more
opportunities to bid on new business. And secondly, it's strengthening the relationships with the businesses that
we've already got because it is integrated, it is single sign-on, the client is able to look down into their custody
activity near real time. I think there's the real benefits to our clients that are paying off.
And I mentioned that they're really – as we think through the partnerships, they're really coming in two flavors, the
other type is everything that we are doing with fintechs. And so, we've announced quite a few. Just this week we
announced one where we're working with the fintech to provide independent alternative NAVs for funds. So, this
provides both an oversight function and it enhances the control. And in addition, it serves as a contingency if there
were a problem in construction of the NAV.
So, we've partnered with them. Some of our clients have actually looked to use them, but they found the
implementation would have been too difficult. And so, by partnering with them implementing, we gain scale from
doing that, as well as providing it as a service rather than just as a piece of software. So, we're pretty excited.
That's already attracted quite a bit of attention this week.

[indiscernible] (48:49). It's so difficult, Robert, for us to be able to identify any single particular incident on a day-

look at the Fed's balance sheet and you look at our balance sheet related to deposits, you'll see that there is a

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Yeah. I actually think we are in pretty good shape. What we're trying to do, Vivek, is kind of get ahead of the
game. And if you think about some of the things that we're doing, I just walked through a whole list of
partnerships, and kind of differentiated in capabilities and this willingness to integrate with best-in-class, we're not
always going to be able to deliver the best application and we want to provide our clients flexibility.
So that holds when we look at Pershing, it holds when we look at Asset Servicing, we've made some very good
investments in our Corporate Trust business and we're starting to gain back market share. We had lost a little
market share over the years. I like where we are in Wealth Management, I think we can continue to do better
there. So, I think this is a matter of trying to break out not catch-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Is there any room to improve the efficiency of tech spend? What we hear from others is they're trying to
flatten it, shift the mix of what they're spending on. You're hearing from competitors and peers of yours. Is there
room for you to do that and if not, when can we start to see that flatten up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I think Todd highlighted a little bit of that in his script, where we are as focused about driving
efficiency in our technology spend as we are anywhere else in the company. And we reduced the number of apps
by 10%. There's another 10% coming. So, it's over a 20% reduction of our apps. And as we make these
investments in the underlying infrastructure and application, it makes the next set of investments we want to make
that much more efficient, cheaper, faster. And so, it's something you're already seeing in the spend that we're
making.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, do you have a range or something on operating margin where you think you can get to with all of this tech
spend as we look out a year or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. We haven't given you a view on go-forward operating margins, Vivek. But as I said earlier, I think as we get
through the short term and medium term on net interest revenue, we do feel confident that the model still holds
where we'll be able to deliver, for a little bit of revenue growth, a pretty significant amount of earnings growth. And
I think that implies expansion in operating margin at that point. So, I think I would just model that way. I think the
guide we gave you a while ago now at Investor Day a couple years ago is probably a good way to think about it
still.

again, those two drivers.

I know you like to do the arithmetic there Vivek, but we look at that since it's novated down the size matters, the
spread matters and then the overall rate matters. Ultimately, we're generating a spread that's been novated down.
That spread has been weak and weaken consistent, but in the third quarter we saw the spike with an unusual
activity in the repo market.

Hi. You mentioned retiring apps, you've retired 10%, 10% more to go. What's the total number of apps that you
have? And I don't think this is completely related, but what percent of apps on desktops are web-based versus
having old versions that could support them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I'm going to turn this one over to Mike, Mike. But in terms of the – we don't disclose the total number of apps. I
don't believe we've disclosed...

Michael Santomassimo A

No.

Thomas P. Gibbons A

...total number of apps that we've got, but we've obviously got a pretty careful inventory of those apps. And part of
what we're doing in our resiliency build-out in infrastructure investment is also making ourselves more efficient by
being able to sunset [ph] or eliminate (55:11) some of these applications. And so, I'm pleased that we're down

10%, probably closer to 12% now, and we've got another 10% or so that we'd probably take out over the course
of the next 12 to 18 months. So, I can't really get into the specifics of where those apps are in terms of what base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Mike, I'm not – I think that I'm not sure that's the right way to think about it. Not all modern apps are web-
based apps, but I think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are always getting better
and we're always investing in those. And that gets – we have, every weekend of the year there's something that's
being rolled out across our product suite through either internal folks or external folks and that improves the way
they work. So, [indiscernible] (56:11).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. In terms of productivity tools, we are rolling out processing the cloud version of Microsoft's Office 365. And
one of the things that we're also doing is our operations. We get over 1 million client email queries each year and
we are developing AI around making that much more productive and responsive in responding to it. So, we're
continuing to invest a lot in productivity and the infrastructure build that we have that we're making I think will help
us do that as well.

And then just one follow-up. So, just generally speaking you said you're spending more in technology. What was
that, $3 billion going up to what number? I'm not sure if you said that, if you are willing to do so. And when do you
think that turns? Like if you – if we think of it going down the J-curve, when do you come up the other side with
these investments? Is that like a year or three years or five years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Let me make one comment, and Mike can get into more of the details. As we've really picked up the tech spend
over the past three years, I would say the rate has come down slightly, although the total amount continues to go
up because it's not a little bit of a bigger base, but rate of growth has probably come down. I don't know, Mike, if
you want [ph] us to really – the J-curve as (57:37) you can think through how quickly we amortize infrastructure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, I mean look Mike, I think the – the way we think about the tech spend is it's not a – we're shooting to spend
a certain number. What we're doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute, what are the
business cases, how do we think about like the return we're going to get on them, and most importantly, like can
we successfully execute it and do we have people in place to do it.
And I think that's driving – and that's going to be the constraint that we've got in most years is making sure that we
can execute it well. And I think right now we feel it's important to continue to make those investments because
that's what's going to differentiate us going forward.
And keeping in mind that we've got to deliver bottom-line – on bottom-line as well. And so, we're trying to find the
balance there to make sure that we're doing the right thing by all of our stakeholders. And so, that's the way we
go about how much we're going to spend in any given year.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So, that' a really good point. So, as we look out to next year I don't want to predict this because if there's
not an ROI on the total spend, we'll bring it down. But right now we believe there is.
