Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, A.B. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review fourth quarter results for
Cullen/Frost, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will provide additional comments before we open it up
for your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $100.9 million, or $1.55 per share, compared with earnings of $189.5
million, or $2.91 a share, reported in the same quarter last year. Now, these results were affected by a $51.5
million one-time FDIC insurance surcharge associated with the bank failures that happened early in 2023.
Our return on assets and common equity for the fourth quarter were 82 basis points and 13.51%, respectively,
and that compares with 1.44% and 27.16% for the same quarter same period last year. For full year 2023, the
company's annual net income available to common shareholders was $591.3 million. That's an increase of 3.3%
compared to 2022 earnings available to common shareholders of $572.5 million. On a per share basis, 2023 full
year earnings were $9.10 a share compared to $8.81 a share reported in 2022.
As we mentioned in this morning's press release, adjust for the one-time FDIC insurance surcharge, our yearly
earnings would have been up by approximately 10% over 2022. The solid fourth quarter and full year
performance is due to the continued strong execution of our organic growth strategy by Frost Bankers, who
provide our customers with top-quality service and experiences that make people's lives better.

Our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remain consistently strong. Frost remains very well-capitalized, and has
a 45% loan-to-deposit ratio. Also, as was the case in previous quarters, Cullen/Frost did not take on any home
loan advances, participated in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing, access any broker deposits,
or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangements to build insured deposit percentages. And additionally, our available
for sale securities portfolio represented more than 80% of our portfolio total at quarter-end.
Our average deposits grew in the fourth quarter to $41.2 billion, up an annualized 3.5% from the $40.8 billion in
the previous quarter. Average loans also grew in the fourth quarter to $18.6 billion, compared with $18 billion in
the third quarter. That was an annualized increase of 14.3%.
We continue to see excellent results from our organic growth program. For example, our original Houston
expansion locations stand at 103% of original deposit goal, 155% loan goal, and 122% of our new household
goal. For what we call our Houston 2.0 locations, the last of which will open this year, we stand at 297% of deposit
goal, 351% of loan goal, and 185% of new household goal. As of quarter-end, the expansion loans and deposits
represented approximately 24% and 19%, respectively, of our total Houston market presence.
For the Dallas market expansion, we stand at 217% of deposit goal, 269% of loan goal and 198% of our new
household goal. While still relatively early in this effort, expansion loans represent approximately 12%, and
deposits represented approximately 10% of Dallas market totals. We've opened up almost two-thirds of our
planned locations in the Dallas market, and we look forward to their growth as these locations mature past at the
start-up phase.
And we're also excited about our new Austin expansion effort where we plan to open 17 locations to double our
presence in that market, as we've mentioned before. And the first of those opened in 2023, and the next is
scheduled to open in April.
Keep in mind that we've been successful generating core stable grassroots business in our expansions, and that
will generate significant value over the long term. At year-end, our overall expansion efforts had generated $1.9
billion in deposits and $1.4 billion in loans, even though many of these locations are still early in their
development.
Looking at our consumer banking business, we continue to see outstanding organic growth, and we ended 2023
with a record net new household growth of 28,632 households. Again, that's net growth, and it's 12% higher than
last year's net household growth. In the past three years, we've added 81,000 net new consumer checking
households. That's 2.6 times more than the three years before that. And that shows that our organic growth
strategy, combined with our customer experience and reputation, is key to our success. We have the right
products and services and relationships to help customers in our markets.
Also, as we've noted, we're excited about the prospects for our new mortgage product. We completed the product
rollout in December, to the last of our regions, which was the Houston region. And in the fourth quarter, we
approached the milestone of originating our first 100 mortgages, and we expect faster growth in 2024.
Looking at our commercial business, our weighted pipeline is at $1.175 billion, and that was down from the record
that we set, $1.918 billion, in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we brought in 960 new relationships. That's
the third highest quarterly amount ever, up an unannualized 8.7% over the third quarter and up 21% over the
fourth quarter last year. This shows me that our success in growing our business organically includes not only a
consumer, but also commercial business as well.

For the full year, new commercial relationships added $806 million in new loan balances and $800 million in new
deposits. Credit quality continues to be good by historical standards, with nonaccrual loans down from the
previous quarter and net charge-offs at healthy levels. Problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 or higher,
totaled $571 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That was up from the $513 million at the end of the second
quarter and $320 million this time last year. This growth in the fourth quarter was evenly split between loans in the
OAEM and classified categories. Another way of saying risk grade 10 and risk grade 11 categories.
Non-performing assets totaled $62 million at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with $68 million last quarter
and $39 million a year ago. The year-end figure represents just 32 basis points of period end loans and 12 basis
points of total assets. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $10.9 million compared to $5.2 million last
quarter and $3.8 million a year ago. Annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter represent 23 basis points of
average loans, and full year charge-offs were 18 basis points of loans.
Regarding commercial real estate lending, our overall portfolio remained stable with steady operating
performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values. Within this
portfolio, what we would consider to be the major categories of investor CRE that is office, multifamily, retail, and
industrial as examples. Total $3.9 billion or 44% of total CRE loans outstanding.
Our investor CRE portfolio has held up well with the average performance metrics slightly improved quarter over
quarter, exhibiting an overall average loan to value of about 53% and weighted average debt service coverage
ratio of about 1.44. The Investor Office portfolio, in particular, had a balance of $891 million at quarter end, which
was down from $959 million the prior quarter. That portfolio exhibited an average loan to value of 49% and an
average debt service coverage ratio of 1.54 and healthy occupancy levels, all of which improved from the prior
quarter.
Our comfort level with our Office Portfolio continues to be based on the character and expertise and experience of
our borrowers and sponsors, as well as with the predominantly Class A nature of our office building projects. And
again, we're glad to be operating in Texas. More than 90% of our office portfolio projects were in Frost markets,
which are Texas' major metropolitan areas. We continue to see good economic growth and strong levels of in-
migration of both people and businesses. I also wanted to note that from September 30 to December 31, total
Investor Office outstandings decreased 7% from the linked quarter and total commitments decreased by 9%.
Finally, I'll point out that we've just rolled out a new Frost marketing campaign and brand refresh, designed to
emphasize the great customer experiences we provide in order to differentiate our voice in a crowded banking
marketplace. We've been talking for some time about the need to invest in marketing capabilities to complement
the organic success we've been achieving. And we're optimistic about the impact this will make in customer
acquisition.
So in closing, we remain optimistic for what lies ahead and we're capitalizing on opportunities. We're enhancing
and expanding our brand. And I'm proud of everything that our Frost teams are accomplishing across our
communities.
And now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Thank you, Phil. Let me start off by giving some additional color on our Houston 1.0 expansion results. As Phil
mentioned, we've been very pleased with the volumes we've been able to achieve. Looking at the fourth quarter,
linked quarter growth in average loans and deposits were $52 million and $78 million, respectively, each
representing approximately 24% annualized growth. And for the fourth quarter, Houston 1.0 contributed $0.07 to
our quarterly earnings per share.
Now moving to our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was 3.41%,
down 3 basis points from the 3.44% reported last quarter. Some positives for the quarter included higher yields
and volumes of both loans and balances at the Fed. These positives were primarily offset by higher costs and
volumes of deposits and customer repos compared to the third quarter. Looking at our investment portfolio, the
total investment portfolio averaged $19.8 billion during the fourth quarter, down $723 million from the third quarter.
During the quarter, we did not make any material investment purchases. The net unrealized loss on the available
for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was $1.39 billion, a decrease of $825 million from the $2.2 billion
reported at the end of the third quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the fourth
quarter was 3.24%, flat with the third quarter. The taxable portfolio, which averaged $13.1 billion down
approximately $471 million from the prior quarter had a yield of 2.75%, down 1 basis point from the prior quarter.
Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $6.7 billion during the fourth quarter, down about $252 million
from the third quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.26%, flat with the prior quarter. At the end of the
fourth quarter, approximately 71% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the
investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.0 years, down from 5.7 years at the end of the third
quarter.
Looking at deposits on a linked quarter basis, average deposits of $41.2 billion were up $356 million or 3.5% on
an annualized basis from the previous quarter. We did continue to see a mix shift during the quarter as average
noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $126 million or 0.9% while interest bearing deposits increased
$482 million or 1.9% when compared to the previous quarter. Based on the fourth quarter average balances,
noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 35.7% compared to 36.3% in the third
quarter.
Looking at January month-to-date averages for total deposits through yesterday, they are basically flat with our
fourth quarter average of $41.2 billion. For January month-to-date through yesterday, the average noninterest
bearing deposit balance was $14.39 billion, down $309 million from the fourth quarter average, affected by
seasonality as those deposits tend to peak in the fourth quarter and soften in the first half of the year.
For January month-to-date average, interest bearing deposits through yesterday were $26.8 billion, up $309
million from our fourth quarter average. In the January month-to-date average, we do continue to see a shift in the
mix in interest-bearing deposits to higher cost CDs from lower cost products. The cost of interest-bearing deposits
in the fourth quarter was 2.27%, up 15 basis points from 2.12% in the third quarter. Customer repos for the fourth
quarter averaged $3.8 billion, up $225 million from the $3.5 billion average in the third quarter. The cost of
customer repos for the quarter was 3.75%, up 8 basis points from the third quarter. The month-to-date January
average for customer repos was basically flat with the fourth quarter.
Looking at noninterest income and expense on a linked quarter basis, I'll just point out a couple of items. The
other noninterest income category included a $3.5 million recovery of a fraud related loss accrual that we
recognized in the fourth quarter last year. Salaries and wages included approximately $8.8 million in higher stock
compensation compared to the third quarter. As a reminder, our stock awards are granted in October of each
year, and some awards, by their nature, require immediate expense recognition.

The other noninterest expense category included a donation to our Frost Charitable Foundation of $3.5 million.
Regarding estimates for full-year 2024, our current projections include five 25 basis point cuts for the Fed Funds
Rate over the course of 2024. For the full year of 2024, we currently expect full year average loan growth in the
mid- to high-single digits. Full-year average deposit growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Net interest income growth
in the range of 2% to 4% with the net interest margin percentage expected to be slightly higher for full-year 2024
than the 3.45% we reported for 2023.
Noninterest income could be relatively flat given the pressure facing the industry on interchange revenues and
OD/NSF fees. Noninterest expense growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a reported basis. Regarding net charge-
offs, we do expect those to go up in 2024 to a more normalized historical level of 25 basis points to 30 basis
points of average loans, given the unusually low level we've seen in the last few years. Regarding taxes, our
effective tax rate for the full year of 2023 was 16.1%, and we currently expect a comparable effective tax rate in
2024.
Going forward, given the wide range of analysts' estimates and the resultant impact on the mean of estimates, we
do not plan to comment on consensus EPS as we have in the past and will instead provide our outlook for the
major building blocks of our profitability.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

I guess maybe first question for Jerry. Your outlook with the five rate cuts for NII growth, you mentioned about 2%
to 4%. Just give us a sense of the sensitivity. My understanding is the balance sheet is still asset sensitive. So
first, whether that's right or wrong. And then as the year progresses, do you expect NII to just lower or do we build
from fourth quarter levels? And are you just outrunning rate cut impact because of balance sheet growth and fixed
rate assets repricing?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's a lot. Let me first say that, yes, we still are asset sensitive. I think we've talked about this in the past. I'll just
kind of go through some of the pieces of it and fill in as I can remember your question. But one of the upsides that
we talked about was that we've got – projected about $3 million in proceeds from our investment portfolio. And
about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion remember correctly, is in the first quarter. So, a big chunk of it comes in. And the
yields that, that portfolio has, I think we've talked in the past about some specific Treasury securities that we had
purchased. I think $750 million of that is going to mature here this month. And the yield on that portfolio was little
[ph] 1.02% (00:22:48), I think it was. So, some of what we're seeing is a pickup that we're going to get just from
the – even if we don't reinvest in investment securities, even in that rate environment that we've discussed, it
would still be favorable to our net interest margin percentage.
We've also seen some improvements I was noting in our fourth quarter loan spreads that we booked -not huge,
but there are some improvements during the quarter. I think that's going to be a positive to us as well. So I mean,
I think overall, we're feeling good about net interest income and net interest margin based on where we're at. I
mentioned that we continue to see a mix change, but the changes that we're seeing at this point in my mind aren't
really material. I think, especially in a rate environment where we've been for a while now and even if you said it
was flat, I think the bulk of the rate competition for the most part has gone. We still continue to see, especially
smaller banks, smaller, local, and regional banks be what I think is really – putting out some unrealistic deposit
rates that we're not going to match. I think we've always said to the community that we don't intend to be the
highest rate in the market, but we do want to be competitive.
In a rate environment as we portrayed it, I think we find ourselves being able to be more competitive on money
market funds because our betas typically have been of a range – we'll take money market – have been like 60%.
In that the rate environment that we're talking about some of those shorter duration investments that those funds
would be making. They have 100% beta, if you will. So I think we'll find ourselves in a much more competitive
situation. You heard me say we're not projecting a huge growth in deposits, so I think that we feel really excited
about the level of loans and deposits that are coming from our expansion branches. I think we're really excited
about that. We've also talked about continually about the nice growth that we've had in commercial relationships.
As we've said in the past, those relationships take a little bit longer to get all the accounts moved over and
signatures of cards done, et cetera.
So I think overall, we're not too aggressive on deposits. I think there – it's still to be seen. We saw a little bit of a
downtick, as I said, in January on the commercial DDA. But as we look at our trends, that's really pretty normal for
us. So no, I think we're still feeling good about all that and still feel like a – we've got some room to improve on the
NIM percentage and net interest income. We're not talking on net interest income, so I gave guidance on 2% to
4% and that's given the rate environment that we're talking about. If we were talking about a flat environment, just
to give you some perspective, I'd probably be talking about increasing those percentages, say 1.5%. And we'd
see a little bit nicer improvement in our NIM in that situation.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
That is good color. So thanks for your patience [ph] there, J. (00:25:52) And maybe a question just on loan
growth. When I look at the period end balance, it would equate to about 5% growth starting out for the year. So it
suggests that you don't expect as much momentum on loan growth looking forward. So, maybe Phil, give us
some perspective around customer sentiment and whether you are seeing that slowdown play out. And given that
we're going – entering sort of an election cycle, do you expect loan growth to be weighed down by that as well?

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, it's a good question, Ebrahim. I think that with regard to sentiment, I believe that things are slowing some
with regard to that, and I think some of it is what you mentioned that typically happens with election year. People
are wanting to know what the regulatory environment is going to look like. So I think there's some of that. I think
there's just a general slowdown and some other things and interest-sensitive areas, say, like obviously real
estate, commercial real estate deals, some interest-sensitive areas like, let's say, used cars, for example, if you're
looking at a specific segment. So there is some of that. And I look at our pipelines also. Our new loan
commitments were up about 9% linked quarter annualized. So, recent activity has been good. But when I look at
our opportunities, they are down a little bit from where they were last year. They're down about 7%. On a linked
quarter basis, they're down about 17% depending on whether you're looking at customer or prospects, prospects
were down about 26%. So, that just shows what's kind of going into the hopper, if you will, says to me that we're
slowing in terms of what's available and what we're seeing.
I should point out that if you did look at our core loans, which are those loan relationships under $10 million, that if
you look versus last year, those were actually up 28%. So, we've seen most of the slowdown year-over-year to be
in larger deals. And I think that represents that expansion strategy. It is a very core business-centric strategy and
we've had really good growth there. So I think that's propping that up. So, yeah, I would agree that things look a
little bit slower. Not bad. As I said, Jerry has guided us to high-single digits loan growth. And I think that's a
realistic number for us. And we'll get through the election and see where that takes us.

I want to start, so on expenses so Jerry, the guidance was off recorded expenses. So if I take the FDIC charge
out gathering at the midpoint, 12% expense growth, something like that for 2024. Now, I'm curious because you
guys used to be a mid- to high-single-digit expense grower, but you're having this really great success with all the
expansion. How do we think about expenses beyond 2024, right? Do you go to the next market or deeper in

existing and expansion continues? Like should we think about Frost as being a low-double-digit expense bank
while you continue for the next several years on expansion? Or does it throttle down at some point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, Steve, I'll talk broadly a little bit and then Jerry might throw in some color. I think there are two Frosts, right?
I mean, there is what I'll call legacy Frost, which is our business that we've built up over the 155 years. And then
there is expansion Frost, which is a company that has really come into its own with its ability to grow organically in
markets and build households and accounts. And we're going to keep leaning into that. And our experience
shows that it's great. It's worthwhile to the shareholder. I mean, for Houston to be 25% represented by expansion,
I think that's pretty remarkable and I think it shows it – we'll take share in this game. So that'll be higher. I would
like to believe though, if we go past this year, that even though we're going to continue to be expanding, I'd like to
see our expense growth rate be a little bit less because we talked about the generational investment in IT that we
made earlier this year. I think it was – we talked about it. We talked about the marketing expenses that we've built
up, which we really need to build that infrastructure.
And so, some of this is building things up that I hope we don't have to continue to do. And so, I think our expense
rate will be elevated from what it was historically, but mainly because of our growth strategy and our expansion
strategy. But when you look at the legacy part of the bank and how we operate on a regular basis, I think we're
still pretty tight. And I'll be proud of our expense management on that basis. Jerry, any thought?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I agree with everything Phil said, Steven. I would say that even in this environment, we won't go into a lot of
details, but I'll tell you that we continue to make sure that we're looking at for any – looking very closely at any
request for additional capitalizable items or for new FTEs. And we're really focused on that. So it's not like the
door is open and everything's getting approved. And so, I'm very much in the camp.
As Phil says, we need and we will try to continue to control expenses. I think he talked about a couple of things,
but just to give a little bit more – put a little bit more meat on it. Some of the things that we've talked about from
technology and from marketing to give the two examples that he mentioned, weren't really in our full run rate for
all of 2023. So some of the lift that we're seeing is just trying to get the full-year impact of some of those
expenses. Some of the people that weren't hired until late in the year, for example, whether it's in the IT area or in
the marketing area, and some of those programs hadn't started. So some of it is just trying to get that into our run
rate.
So, I agree with Phil, I would expect that going forward, I don't see us going back to a 3% to 4% growth given our
organic expansion strategy. But I would hope that operating at these higher levels is certainly not our current
expectation based on what we're seeing. And of course, in this environment, we did continue to do some things
for our employees where we've done, I think, a great job of taking on some additional costs, corporate-wide that
had previously been covered by the employees. As an example, we cover more of the medical that we did
historically. And again, some of those things just trying to be more competitive and at the same time treating our
employees with grace and knowing what a competitive market that we're operating in.
So long winded answer to say, I agree with Phil, I don't think that we'll be operating at this level past this year that
we're talking about. And we continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses.

Steven, I'd also point out that with regard to the expansion, I mean, the numbers are the numbers and we're
proud of what we're able to do. But I'll [ph] just fill (00:33:52) a couple of things out there, too, that we're looking at
and you might be interested in. When someone comes here, we'll survey broad group of people who are our new
customers, we'll ask them what influenced you most in choosing Frost as your bank. And the number one
response is convenient locations. And number two, a close second is recommendation from a friend and it drops
off by about a-third being 24/7 live customer support, and then it drops off by about, say, 15% to convenient ATM
network and then it goes to other and a lot of different things. But it shows in what we ask our customers what are
the things that brought you here. And remember the growth we've had, growth in households. And those are the
responses our customers have given.
And the other thing I'll point out and we said this before and I'll update this and give a little bit more color. If you
look at our Houston expansion, which is still – we've still got some developing new branches there which aren't
fully – we only had one, I think, in the five-year anniversary but that was recently. But if you look at the
relationships, the new accounts that are opened in Houston, 85% of the Houston expansion new accounts are
opened within 5 miles of a Frost Financial Center and 44% of the Houston expansion new accounts are located
within 2 miles. So, again, we're not trying to process transactions at these locations, but we are projecting our
brand into these communities and we're leveraging our value proposition. And you heard me say that the number
2 reason was referrals from a friend. So, I like to look at it as a virtuous cycle of what we're doing, how it's all
working together. So we're going to continue to lean into that. And will it cost some expense money? Yes, it will.
We're being careful with it, but we really believe it's generating success for the long term.

That's great color. I wanted to ask about commercial real estate. It was funny. This quarter, particularly, I fielded a
ton of questions from investors that they want to buy your stock here. They like where it's trading. They love all
these expansion metrics, commercial real estate concentrations, the thing that's keeping them nervous and I'm
sure you've seen the articles too, Phil, the vacancy rates almost 20% for office at Dallas, Houston, Austin. So my
question to you is, what's your perspective on the commercial real estate market like you see these markets from
the ground level? Is this exaggerated? When you look at your portfolio, I don't think you used to have vacancy
rates anywhere near that. But you gave us some color on your CRE exposure in those markets. You didn't seem
overly concerned, but maybe we could flesh that out for the investors on the call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, what I would say, Steven, is that, first of all, I read that Wall Street Journal article late in the year about, you
know, the vacancy rate in Texas. Let me tell you what. That vacancy rate in Texas is going to be high for a long,
long time. And you know why? It's downtown real estate. This is my opinion. Some of those buildings, I don't
know they'll ever be filled. Some of them [indiscernible] (00:37:28) from the 1980s or 1990s. So, you've got that.
Now, well, I recognize Austin's got new buildings here and they've got significant vacancy. So I'm not trying to
whistle past the graveyard. I'm just trying to say there's some element of that vacancy that it's different than other
vacancies, okay, not all created equal.

But what I would say about commercial real estate is, you heard me say, we saw an increase in problem loans
this quarter. That's risk rated 10 or higher. But it really wasn't from commercial real estate at all. In fact, if you look
at what happened – let's take commercial office. We had three pay-downs of Investor Office that totaled $95
million. One of them, they paid off for cash. One came due paid it all for cash. It's a significant deal in a downtown
major market. We had one that was in a medical center of a major market. They put lots of cash in it and
refinanced the rest. We had another one that we sold. It was a completely performing loan. But the owner had
some other problems, other places. And it was in Austin. And we said, look, we got a really good bid for that loan
and we sold it. We took a I think was a 7% discount on it to do it. But those are three examples of Investor Office
in Texas where we're operating, where it worked out okay because you've got the right structures, the right
locations and the right sponsors for these things. None of these things were guaranteed.
And so, the increase in problem credits this quarter was really more related to just banking business. Where
you've got someone – there is one credit that came up late. They've got an inventory write-down. They notified us
about, I think – we're still looking into exactly why it happened. They are too. I think it probably relates to an
accounting, at least some to an accounting system, perpetual inventory system they put in. But we'll see. But they
basically been operating with an understated cost of goods sold. They had to write down some inventory. So,
that's an unusual thing that happens in business at times. It doesn't have anything to do with interest rates or
office building vacancy rates, right?
There was another that was liquor distributor that lost a supplier. And they've got to cut some overhead. They'll be
fine. But it's those kind of basic banking things that are the reason we saw the increase in risk rate 10 and then
higher. And it wasn't because of the real estate at all. In fact, that's sort of improved.
And the other thing I'll say is we're not stopping doing business in the Texas market. I mean, granted, we're in the
Texas market, thank goodness, I mean. I'd put it up against any market that in the US and we're still seeing
opportunities. There're fewer of them and competition for the really good deals are still there. But we're still seeing
opportunities in commercial real estate that make total sense to us because of the properties and the structure
and the sponsors for the deals.
So, my worry right now isn't really commercial real estate. I mean, we've been working on it for probably a long 18
months or whatever. But what I've been seeing, [ph] and let's take these payoffs (00:41:42) we talked about. And
we also had one that was a risk rate 11 last year. I didn't even mention it. It was $41 million deal. It's not an office
building. It's an industrial deal that there was a hole in it. It was a great piece of property for a credit tenant. But
rates go up. There's a hole in it. The owner sells it. He brings cash to the table. So, that's not really – it's been
performing the way I think we hoped it would. Will there be some issues? I'm sure there will be, have been a few. I
think we got one nonperforming office building we talked about few quarters ago.
But it is not a train wreck in the markets we're in and the relationships that we're in, in commercial real estate. And
we're watching it and we'll keep talking to people. I mean, I'll keep going on with this answer. But I mean, these
are things that need to be said. You could say, well, what's the biggest exposure on paper? And it's probably your
construction portfolio for multifamily, and it's because the debt service coverage ratios of those things, it's
improved a little bit, but they're still not where they'll need to be to get them refi-ed or get a permanent financing.
But when you look at that, I think only 6% of those come due in this year. I think 75% of them come due in 2026
or later. And then when you look at the people behind them, and I'm not going to name names here, but if you
look at the people we do business with, they understand this business. This is not like somebody who thought,
gee, let's get in the multifamily business and find a banker that will bank us. I mean, these are people who've
been doing this a long time. And I feel really good about the relationships and how they take care of their
12

business. Again, I'm not saying we can't have problems, but this is how life is on a day-to-day basis around here.
And so, anyway, that's what I know.

Hi, Dave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, I was hoping you guys could talk about what's your NII guide mean for the NIM trajectory. You've got the low
rates that you're [indiscernible] (00:44:35) rolling off this month and then you've got the rate cuts coming in later in
the year. Does the thought that you get some expansion here in the first half of the year, then maybe that turns
south in the back half of the year? And then what does that mean for the exit NIM by the end of the year? Is that
going to be higher than where you were this quarter or are you thinking that might be lower? And then you
mentioned deposit betas earlier. I was just wondering what your guys thoughts were on how fast you can do
those deposit costs down since you were very focused on being proactive I know on the way up. Are you thinking
you can bring those down just as fast, basically assuming the same type of beta on the way down. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I guess I'll start with that last question first. I think the thought process is that we could be – go down just
fast. But at the same time, I'll say that we don't ignore the market. I said earlier, we're not going to feel like we
need to leave the market but we're going to be competitive. So, I would answer the question that by saying that
we were up fast. I think we've kept up all along with all the hikes and I feel like we can be pretty aggressive going
down, but we're not going to keep our head in the sand. And if the market's not moving down as quickly as we
thought it might we'll certainly react accordingly.
As far as the NIM, I guess what I'd say is that, yeah, we are relatively flat, flattish all year. And so, yeah, I think
you said it. We really kind of take a step-up in the first quarter's at current expectation. We do have in our
13


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
projections a cut in March so we do take a hike up in the NIM that first quarter, and then really kind of given the
conversation that we had earlier, and a lot of it will be dependent on liquidity right and what happens with
deposits, how much we're keeping at the Fed, et cetera. But right now, guidance I would give is once we – in the
first quarter, the rest of the quarters will be relatively flat. So we get a lot of the help in that first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. What are you guys assuming for the NII or the NIM impact from a single rate cut at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The answer I'd give you is about $1 million a month. And again, I think that's one where it will be dependent on
what happens with how much liquidity we've got at the it happens. It could be more if there was more liquidity on
the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
But how are you guys thinking about managing the securities book through the year? I know you didn't purchase
anything this past quarter. You've got the securities rolling off this quarter. Is the thought to just let that run off this
year allowing any kind of cash flow into loans or paying down borrowings, that kind of thing, are you going to be
replacing some of that along the way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Our current expectation is that, and I think I've said earlier that we're projecting about $3 billion in cash flow from
that portfolio. Right now, we're projecting that – I'm sorry?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Oh, yeah. No, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, we're projecting that $1.5 billion to $2 billion is what we would be invest, more likely closer to the lower end.
And we're really just kind of saying we've got our investment guys who really are paying attention to the market
and we'll just look where there's value and we'll continue to try to be opportunistic. I think we've been successful
in a lot of cases. And we'll just have to see what's happening. But that's what our current expectation is that we'd
spend about half of that liquidity. We feel good about deposits, like I said, but kind of would like – you know us
well enough to know that we tend to keep a pretty high level of liquidity. But that's our guidance. We'll spend
about half of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A

Half of the runoff.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Got it. And maybe just one last one. Where are you seeing securities yields at this point, I know a little change to
the year but curious [ph] for what you're buying for that (00:48:41).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We're not buying anything. I think that the last time we talked and we were looking at mortgage backeds, and I
think they were a little bit – gosh, I almost hesitate to say. We really haven't been spending a lot of time [ph] with
either (00:48:58) investment guys or we haven't made any purchases for two quarters now, but certainly north of
$5 billion, and nothing's really enticed us. We're really – we just kind of want to see how this first quarter plays
out. But if we do see something where we think there's real value, the good thing about an organization like ours
is that [indiscernible] (00:49:17) group that makes those sorts of decisions, is works very closely together. We're
meeting all the time, and certainly could make a decision really at the snap of a finger. So our guys are keeping
their pulse on the market. But at this point, really haven't felt a lot of pressure like that we need to do something
today.

Manan Gosalia Q

Follow up to the question on liquidity. I mean, I guess if rates come down in line with the five rate cuts or so that
you're estimating, non-interest-bearing deposits stabilize, can you deploy more of those high levels of liquidity that
you're keeping on your balance sheet? I know that the deposit ratio forecasting is lower than the loan growth ratio
15


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
forecasting. So, presumably, we'll use some of that. But can you bring that 14%, 15% of assets and cash down
meaningfully as we 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it depends on what meaningfully means. You're never going to see us running with $1 billion at the Fed, for
example. And that's just not the way we operate. But could we make some decisions that had us potentially,
especially if we felt good about the economy, we felt good about what was going on with deposit growth and such,
could we find ourselves in a position where we were deploying more of that liquidity? I'd say, yes, but this is going
to be dependent on a lot of factors, what's going on in the economy, those sorts of things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then given your comments on expenses earlier and there is some one-time or temporary nature of
some of the expenses that you mentioned, at what point do you get back to positive operating leverage? So I
know there's a bit of noise in the revenue line this year with the base effect of rising rates in 2023 and then the
rate cuts in 2024. But if rates should stabilize from there, how quickly do you think you can return to positive
operating leverage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's a math question. Honestly, I don't know the answer to. But here's what I do know, that the success that we're
having developing these markets, as expensive as it is, will create significant positive shareholder value. Now,
does that manifest itself in a positive operating leverage trend? Probably. But honestly, I'm not close enough to
math to tell you when it would happen, but it's – at some level, it's just basic business, and it's just a recognition of
what we're developing and understanding the basic profitability of a regional community middle market focused
bank, because that's really what we're creating in these markets. We're creating footprints that basically look like
Frost Bank. And so, whatever that profitability is for a bank like that, that's what we're generating, and I think that's
going to be – that will be positive for a long time. And I'm confident we'll get back to operating leverage positions
that reflect that.
Now, again, like we talked about earlier, as long as we're continuing to do this and finding markets where it make
sense to grow and develop this for shareholders, and how much we do in any one particular a year can affect
operating leverage on a particular year. But I think it would be wise for us to also look at what is the operating
leverage of what I would call the legacy company, the legacy bank, what is that doing as we're expanding in these
markets. It's worth looking into also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good afternoon. Jerry, you gave a little bit of a cautious outlook on fee income being relatively flat. And you talked
about the regulatory environment with overdraft fees and interchange. Are you guys taking action on this now
ahead of any regulation or you just think it's going to be coming down the road this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I'll talk about two pieces of it. The thing for us on the overdraft fees is something that it's not going to be a
growth product for us, right? The reason those revenues are growing is because we've had consistent account
growth. We continue to do changes to the product to ensure that we're doing what we need to be doing from a
fairness standpoint and making sure we're serving the customers with grace. And so, we're doing a lot of things
beginning in 2023, that those impacts aren't – haven't run completely through the annual financials for 2023. And
then we've got some additional items that we're considering doing to tweak the product there. They're going to tell
– they're telling me that all things being equal, we're not going to expect to see a lot of growth in those overdraft
fees.
On the interchange, that's really going to just be dependent. Our projections right now have those changes going
into effect in the latter part of the year. So just based on the proposal that was out there. So we're not – on the OD
side, we're doing things that we're affecting that revenue ourselves by making some changes to the product that
we're delivering to the customer, which is going to reduce our revenue. In the case of interchange, it's really
based on the anticipated one-third reduction in those fees later this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q

Okay. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

So those are the headwinds that we're dealing with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And then separately, the earnings accretion from the Houston expansion has been really taking
hold and becoming more accretive. Do you think that the Dallas expansion starts to become accretive to earnings
this year? And then secondly, are there opportunities maybe to close some underperforming legacy branches to
defray some of the costs with the new branch buildout?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Let me take – I'm going to step back a second on yourquestion on non-interest income. The other thing that's
affecting us, and I mentioned just one item in the quarter on the sundry income. We did have some nice sundry
income throughout the year that we don't really project those sorts of items into our financials. So, this $3.5 million
recovery of a fraudulent wire that we had in the fourth quarter, obviously, we've got items like that, that go through
our non-interest income that we don't forecast. And so, that obviously has a downward effect too on our forecast
going forward.

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
As far as the Dallas is concerned, our expectation is we're still opening locations in Dallas. And so, as you know,
the most expensive part of this expansion effort is just starting up those locations. And as Phil said, the first one in
Houston just reached its five years. And so, as I talk about that profitability, we're really happy with where we're
at.
And when I look at the individual pieces of it and we're not ready to disclose overall kind of how we're doing, but
the plan was and it's working this way, is that as those Houston locations begin to mature more and more, they're
going to start to offset the losses that we have associated with the expansions that have started more recently. So
it's getting to the point where Houston is going to carry more of the expansion cost of the Houston 2.0 and the
Dallas. But Dallas, no. To answer your question, I don't see them being profitable this year just because we still
have locations that we're opening in. And there's not a lot of maturity yet. Although, as Phil said, they performed
really, really well. So, as far as our projections to – or our performance to our goals, we've done really well. But
we're not in a point where we would say Dallas is going to be a profitable next year. We are saying that Houston
is paying more and more of the expansion that we're doing. And so, it's really working, as we planned; as those
branches mature, really helping us pay for future expansions.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:59:02) point. Yeah. So, you are – I mean, if you didn't grow loans a single dollar, you'd already
be up 5% on an average year-over-year. So, on an end of period basis, if you look at period end to period end, I
mean, that loan growth will take a decent step back from the 10% you did last year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I guess what I would say is that, obviously, we tend to rely more on the averages than we do on the period ends.
But the guidance that we've got, we certainly will review that as we get through the quarter and as we head
through the year. But right now, I feel like that sort of guidance is really very realistic based on what we saw. I
think this year, if I went back, if I'm remembering correctly, I think the full year average of 2023 over 2022 was a
little under 8%. And so, really, we're guiding towards something in that arena, maybe a little bit better than that
without knowing exactly what sort of a environment we'll be in. So I think that we're sticking with it. And if we can
do better than that, that'll be great. And we continue to – we have plenty of liquidity. We're not holding back. But at
the same time, all the deals that we're doing have to make sense to us. And I think we've been really good about
growing relationships that we want to grow. We talked last quarter, I think it was about an unusual amount of
opportunities that have come our way, just given the – from the stability that we have and the liquidity that we
have available. But we're just not going to say yes to every deal that we get, right? We're going to be very
selective and make sure that these are quality sort of relationships that we want to continue to develop. But we'll
certainly continue to give up – we'll give guidance and if it's upward on loan growth. We'll certainly support that,
but at this point, this is kind of what we're comfortable with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Just my tag on to what Jerry was saying about looking at deals and making sure they work for us. If you look at
the third quarter and compare to the fourth quarter, we saw a sharp uptick in the number or the percentage of
deals that were lost to structure versus pricing. We lost 66% of the deals in the third quarter to structure, and that
compared to 76% of deals lost to structure in the fourth quarter. And a lot of that, and I'd say the majority of that,
would be in the CRE space. So it's still competitive out there. And I think this shows that we're not just going to do
whatever deal comes our way. We're still going to be careful making sure it's quality stuff and it's done our way.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Then my last question is just on the share repurchase. I saw the new $150 million of authorization. I
think you bought back about $40 million of stock last year in 2023. Should we expect Frost to be active on the
buyback in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I wouldn't – yeah. I think that certainly we'd like to have it available. We like it to have that tool in our toolbox
should the opportunity arise. I wouldn't count on us being significant buyers of our stock unless we really felt like
there was an opportunity, something happened. We'd hate to be in a position where we thought we had a great
value and we didn't have a program in place. So, for us, it's just making sure that if there is some sort of market

dislocation and we think there's a great value for us, that we're able to take advantage of that without having to
jump through a lot of hoops.

Operator: Our next question is from Brandon King with Truist Securities. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, philosophically, with the expectation of no Fed cutting this year, how are you thinking about managing deposit
costs lower? Compared to your peers, you're a little more proactive with rates on the way up. And I just wanted to
know just your insight on how you plan on managing that on the way down, certain account types, exception
pricing, things of that nature?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brandon, we don't – we do very minimal exception pricing. We do some, but it's not a big part of our business. So,
let me start with saying that. I think we said earlier, when we went up, we went up pretty fast. We reacted very
quickly. We thought that that was the right thing to do for our customers. We'll just really look at – as I said earlier,
I'd expect that the betas that we utilize going up will be kind of the first reaction that we have on a down cycle. But
at the same time, we're not going to have our head in the sand. And if there is the competition that we feel we're
competing against, it is really pricing a lot more aggressive than we are than we may have to react. We don't think
we have to be the highest. We're not the highest today. I think we're fortunate in that having won the J.D. Power
Award for 14 consecutive years, I'm looking at Phil, I think it's 14 or 15, and the head of consumer is going to get
mad at me if I missed it. But that's based on customer satisfaction. So, it's not all in the rate. We realized that, that
a lot of it is on customer service and how – what we do to take care of the customer both on the commercial and
the consumer side, but more on the consumer. And that we've got a great, app, mobile app that I think we get a
lot of credit for and that we really try to stay on top of and make sure that we're keeping that at the forefront. And
so, I don't feel like we have to be the highest, and we've proven that in our relatively stable deposit volumes. But
we do have to be competitive, and that's what we're really keep an eye on the most, is making sure that we're
offering our customers [indiscernible] (01:05:10).

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And Brandon, you probably know better than I do, but I mean, money market funds are probably going to have to
be -they're going to be buying a lot of market instruments and those things are going to be going down pretty
consistent with declines in rates, and particularly some short answer. I think it's partly our expectation that their
movement in rates will be sort of inexorable. And there were a lot of competition in this right now anyway. So
that'll give us some ability to compete better against those particular products. And I think, as Jerry said, if we're
competing straight up against a bank, we'll compete pretty well just being close on rate. We won't have to be the
highest in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. And that's helpful. And then I wanted to get more insight into your marketing plan and brand refresh. So,
what are the things that you're planning to do in 2024 that you weren't doing in 2023? And then, could you talk
about kind of the potential and scale of what you could envision that looking like maybe beyond 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, as it relates to the marketing plan, we've really focused on just the look and feel of our brand, how it looks in
the marketplace, and trying to differentiate it from sort of the sea of sameness that's out there, and really trying to
reduce, for sure, the lack of awareness about our brand. And if you are aware, we really want to reduce
indifference to the brand. And so we're trying to utilize things that just visually help us there. We're also – we've
put out some new ads that sort of reflect who we are and some of the amazing stories of customer service that
we're going to have. And we do that with a little bit of humor and a wink that's typical of Frost Bank.
And so I think that the campaign that way is going to be really good. But if you look at it under the hood
[indiscernible] (01:07:23), I think we've done a lot better job. I know we have bringing in partners that are helping
us do a better job with digital marketing and in effectiveness and our digital offerings. And really that even
translates into some of the direct mail pieces that we do, and a lot of that in connection with some of these
branches that we're opening in these new markets, making sure that our response rates [indiscernible] (01:07:52)
improving. So we've seen some interesting results in that with our new partners. And I expect that to be
something that helps drive customer acquisition going forward. So, we'll see, right? I've learned everyone's a
marketing expert [indiscernible] (01:08:11).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Yeah. Just trying to make – just trying to get a sense of this is not kind of a Herculean effort and just kind of
more incremental on the margins?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I don't think so. I think it's – we've built our infrastructure in terms of our internal marketing resources and
capabilities. So that is something that was really a part of what the expense base growth was last year. By and
large, there'll be some follow on as those things annualize to a full year in 2024. But a lot of it is just utilizing the
market spend that we have been spending, but doing it in a more effective way. But it's not the same level of
[indiscernible] (01:09:02) I go back to the generational investment that we did in IT. It's generational through
marketing, but it's not the same size of that investment as IT was.

Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: In the interest of time, we are going to ask that analysts please limit yourself to one question as we
proceed. Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. John, your line is live. Okay.
And our next question will be from Brody Preston with UBS. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, everyone. I'm going to wrap a few into my one here, if you don't mind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
They're all on NII, Jerry. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
All right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
... [indiscernible] (01:10:03). I know you're relying a little bit more on the averages and your other period end, but if
I am working on it up to period end, it looks like the loans and the deposits should kind of – the deposit should
fund the loans. And then you're going to reinvest half of the $3 billion. So you got about $1.5 billion of cash flows
left over from the securities book naturally. I'm wondering if that's going to go into just kind of pushing off the
remaining repurchase agreements that you have on board. And then secondly, I was wondering if you all would
provide us with what the period end savings and interest-bearing checking and money market accounts look like
just because it's a little over a week until we get the K and we can update models in the interim there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. You're saying just the period end rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, the period end balances.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Oh, the period end balances. Yeah. We can get them here for you, but – and if we don't get them to you, A.B. can
certainly give those to you offline if you want to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm sorry, I forgot your first question that you...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That's okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
What were you trying to get at? I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I was saying, if I look at the guidance and look at, like, the implied period end, I know you're relying more on the
averages. I'm wondering – it looks like the deposits can fund the loan growth that you got. I'm wondering what
you're going to do with the additional $1.5 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. I apologize. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That's okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So you mentioned repos. So, for us, customer repos is really a – these customers, for the most part, are really
long-term customers and there is a feature within that product that we make available to them that allows them to
utilize the product. And so, even though it's fully collateralized, they do take a haircut versus the respective MMA
rate. And we may do a little bit of exception pricing there, but for the most part, it's really a very successful product
for us. There are some transactional pieces of it that work to their benefit and they want to be in that product. But
this isn't hot money in any way. These are long-term customers. A lot of them have other deposit – have deposit
relationships as well, significant deposit relationships. So, from our end, we've got a significant amount of
23


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
collateral. It really – it's a good operating business for us, and we don't have any intention of reducing that sort of
a product...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And what do you do...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...from that standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
... [indiscernible] (01:12:50) in that? What do you do with the additional $1.5 billion of cash flows and because if
you park it [indiscernible] (01:12:53)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So, at this point, what we would probably do and what we're modeling is that we would continue to keep
those balances at the Fed. I think I said earlier, we just kind of want to see what happens as far as deposits are
concerned, deposit flows. And so, from our assumptions today, we're really just increasing our balances at the
Fed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And our final question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks for the opportunity. I'm going to tease, Brody, but that's just cruel to box him into one question. I'm
kidding, Brody. Anyway, just on mortgage, how material do you expect it to be in 2024? You said you're all built
out, and I'm just curious on your willingness to hold in on the balance sheet, how big could it be? And do you
expect to sell any of the production?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I can answer the last part of it. We don't expect to sell any of the production. So it's really – Jerry might have
a better feel for that, but it's not going to be as – it's ramping up, right? And so I think what we said early on when
we started this is we expected in five years it would be, you know, the same as the rest of the consumer portfolio.

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
So, at that point, I think it was around $2 billion estimate of what it would be. And so, we're beginning to ramp up.
It's a worse market than when we started, right, in terms of what's available out there, housing wise. But I would
say, it would be – I would – let me venture, I guess, $200 million-ish.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Someone in our mortgage department, but it's just falling down when I said that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. So, not terribly material, but all I know...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, it just not – it's not huge. It's not wagging the dogs, but it is going to be just solid growth as we continue to
develop that product.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Jerry, I think you should have said consensus is a little bit low. My calc
is, it's a little bit low, not by much, but that's my comment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I appreciate your input. Thank you, John.
