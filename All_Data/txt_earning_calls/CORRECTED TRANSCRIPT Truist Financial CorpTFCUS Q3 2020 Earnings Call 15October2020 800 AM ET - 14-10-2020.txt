Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. I really appreciate you all joining our call, and I hope you and your
family are doing well. Now, I would say relative to the challenges that we're all facing, we're really happy to report
what I call a great quarter; strong balance sheet, particularly in asset quality, liquidity, and capital; relatively strong
earnings; great value proposition for our clients, particularly in our digital offerings; great team, which I am
extraordinarily proud of; and a strong commitment to our communities and other stakeholders. We are, as you
know from our previous conversation, really focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build
better lives and communities.
And I'm going to show on slide 5 a few of the things we're doing to live out our purpose. So, we announced
recently something we're very excited about, a $40 million donation to help establish an organization called
CornerSquare Community Capital. This is a new organization that will be focusing on funding to racially and
ethnically diverse small business owners, women, and individuals in LMI communities. This will be done through
CDFIs, Community Development Financial Institutions, and it's a very exciting opportunity to get funds exactly
where they're needed.
We're really proud of our first Truist CSR report. I hope you've had a chance to read it. We launched recently our
Truist Momentum, which is continuation of a SunTrust program that focuses on financial wellbeing. We partnered
with EverFi to introduce – this is something we're very excited about, a game called WORD Force, which helps
kids in K-2 learn how to read. You heard me say in the past, unfortunately, in our country today two-thirds of the
kids in the public school system into third grade cannot read. This is the way of getting at that.
It may not be the [ph] all-in (00:03:56) answer, but it's a really good start. We're excited about it. We're in our beta
test, but we already have over 4,000 students in over 200 schools participating. We are doing a really good job in
terms of conservation of energy, water, and making good progress on a number of areas like that, investing in
those areas to make our climate and our environment better. We did, as you know, announced as a part of
merger, a $60 billion Community Benefits Plan over the next three years. We're very excited about that. And you
can see on the slide, a number of areas that we're really committed to.
I would particularly point out that we will be investing in loans and/or investments of $33 billion over these next
three years in home purchase mortgage loans and to LMI and minority borrowers. So, this is a big part of helping
to deal with some of the social injustice and racial inequity problems that we have in our country; and a number of
other programs that you can see there.
I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to improving our diversity. We said in our CSR
report that we have committed over the next three years to improve our senior leadership diversity from 12% in
2019 to 15%. You can see there that we have a very good and effective diverse board with 45% being women
and minorities. So, we feel really good about that. I would also point out, we were honored to receive a perfect

score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. So, we're doing a
really good job with regard to living our purpose.
If you look at slide 6, I'd just point out a few highlights. We did have taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion. Net
income available to our common shareholders of $1 billion, but adjusted net income available to common was
$1.3 billion. That resulted in diluting earnings per share on adjusted of $0.97. Return on average tangible common
equity adjusted was 16.0%, very strong. And a really good efficiency ratio adjusted at 57.3%. We were really
pleased about our nonperforming assets at 0.26%.
And we recognize that there's more to come with regard to credit quality deterioration depending on what
happens with regard to the economy. But still given where we are today and recognizing there are some positive
impacts with regard to accommodations there, that's a really good number. We feel really good about that. And
likewise, our net charge-offs were 0.42% at the low end of what we had talked about. We're very pleased with our
common equity Tier 1, is now at 10%. So we feel really good about our capital position.
If you look at some selected items on slide 7, I'd just point out we did have security gains of $104 million, which
was a positive $0.06 per share. We had merger and restructuring charges of $236 million, which was $0.13. We
did have incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Remember, these are expenses that don't qualify
for [ph] MERC (00:07:12) in terms of calling out, because they do have future benefits, but they're not a part of our
longer-term run rate. That was $152 million and that was $0.08. And we did make a $50 million unusual
contribution to our charitable foundation and that was $0.03. So if you put all that together, it was a negative
impact to EPS of about $0.18. So, we feel good about the adjusted number because of the quality of the selected
items.
[ph] Onto slide (00:07:41) 8, just a couple of comments with regard to loans. As you all know, loans are a real
challenge for us and for the industry now because of what's going on in the economy. Of course, we did see a big
run up in loans in the second quarter; and likewise, we saw a big run down in loans in the third as a large number
of the corporate line drawdowns were repaid. So we saw total loan reductions of $11 billion, and $9.5 billion of
that was into C&I area. So, that's principally what happened.
We did have some bright spots. We had growth in LightStream, our national consumer digital platform; Sheffield
had a growth; recreational lending; prime auto. We did have some decreases in some other consumer areas like
resi mortgage and so forth. So, it was kind of mixed bag with regard to consumer. But overall, the big story in
loans is, if you exclude the run up in balances in the second and the run down in the third, [ph] growth (00:08:43)
was flat.
I would say to you that we do expect future headwinds. With regard to the PPP loans, we have about $12.5 billion
there. That'll begin to pay off as we head into the fourth and the first and, probably, the second. Loan growth is
really challenging now. Obviously, banks are a reflection of the economy and so we should not be surprised about
that. The real question is what's going to happen to the economy. I would just point out, and this is just one
person's opinion, it's important to look back at previous corrections that we've had and there's virtually always a
material precipitating event.
So in 1991, we had the commercial real estate bubble; 2001, we had the technology bubble; 2008, we had the
residential real estate bubble. But this one didn't have a bubble. This was a very strong 10-year economy, 3.5%
unemployment rate. We just shut it down, appropriately so, for medical reasons, but we shut it down. I made that
point to say that if this pandemic doesn't go on too much longer, there's a chance that we can get a snapback in
the economy that most people would not expect, because it wasn't structurally in trouble to start with.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Now, if it stays on a long time then all bets are off. I personally believe, as we head into the first quarter, we'll
begin to see some real developments with regard to vaccines. We certainly have already had substantial
developments – positive developments with regard to medical mitigation of [indiscernible] (00:10:16) ramification.
So, we are somewhat optimistic although cautious as we think about the economy going forward.
I will tell you, as I get feedback from our client-facing people and while they're not facing them in person as much
today, we're talking to people more probably than we ever did now, although virtually. David Weaver, who runs
our Commercial Community Bank, told me the other day, he had nine calls in one day. So we've been very, very
efficient. But here's the point. Clients are being very resilient. I'm speaking particularly of middle and upper
market.
One of the quotes that I got recently was, clients that say, it's time to move on. And to be honest, that's kind of
what we said. We sat back for a while and didn't make virtual calls, and said, we're waiting for the pandemic. And
then several months ago we just kind of said, we've got to get on with running our business because our clients
need us. So, our clients are being [indiscernible] (00:11:12) saying kind of my business is okay.
Now, the small – very small, micro end is struggling. And depending on how long this lasts, we will see a
substantial shakeout in the small business, micro end market. At the aggregate economic level, that will reshuffle
and reallocate itself; but at a personal level for those small business [ph] they possess a (00:11:38) very sad
story. So we got to hope that this moves along as rapidly as possible. I'll say, finally, that our pipelines are
improving. Our calling activity is robust and we feel very good about where we're going relative to what happens
to the economy.
On slide 9, just a brief comment about deposits which are doing great. We continue to have a nice inflow
somewhat because of the flight to quality. We had $1.4 billion increase in deposits on a linked quarter basis. We
had a $10 billion increase following other previous quarter increases in noninterest-bearing deposits. So, we feel
really good about that. Our noninterest-bearing deposits today are 33.3% of total deposits versus 27.8% in the
first quarter. So you can see how rapidly our DDA or noninterest-bearing deposits have increased.
We've been focusing a lot of our attention with regard to getting our costs down, with regard to deposit structure,
and we've made really good progress here. Our total deposit cost decreased from 12 basis points to 10 basis
points. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 17 basis points, down to 15 basis points. So, really good
progress in managing our cost of deposit. I would point out, if you are following the math in all of our deposit
activity, though, we did divest $2.2 billion in deposits this quarter, and so that's a material factor. So overall, I
would say, our deposits are doing great.
With that, let me turn it to Daryl, for some more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today I want to cover highlights from the third quarter and
provide our fourth quarter outlook. Turning to slide 10. Reported net interest margin decreased 3 basis points,
primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin increased 5 basis points, the first
increase since the first quarter 2019. Core margin benefited from strong DDA growth, lower funding costs, lower
COVID-related deferred interest. Lower yields on loans and securities remain a headwind.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
During the quarter, we used excess reserves to purchase $5 billion of high-quality securities, improving our yield
on those assets by approximately 100 basis points. Our asset sensitivity increased in the third quarter and we
plan to stay slightly asset sensitive. We will continue to protect our margin by placing rate floors on commercial
loans and manage deposit costs.
Due to our excess funding position, we are being strategic about deposit costs by focusing on growing
noninterest-bearing deposits. Given the low rate environment, we are placing pay fixed swaps to partially hedge
our investment securities and associated changes in OCI. We expect the reported net interest margin to slightly
decrease for the remainder of the year.
Turning to slide 11. Adjusted noninterest income was relatively flat versus a robust second quarter. Fee income
categories impacted by the pandemic continue to improve. Our activity on deposits is normalizing coupled with
lower fee waivers. Card and payment related fees increased as payment volumes improved. Wealth management
income increased as a result of higher market valuations.
Despite the seasonally weak quarter, insurance income grew 6.4% on a like quarter basis due to firmer pricing
and uptick in new business. Residential mortgage income decreased primarily due to a $72 million change in the
net MSR valuation driven by higher prepayments. Investment banking had a record quarter. Trading was off from
a great second quarter, resulting in lower revenue. Other income increased due to the increase in the value of
non-qualified plan assets and other investments.
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense decreased $123 million, as losses on debt extinguishment and higher
intangible amortization during the second quarter were partially offset by higher merger-related costs and a
charitable contribution. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $20 million, primarily due to an increased
personnel expense, marketing costs, and professional services. The increase in personnel expense reflects
higher non-qualified plan costs that were offset by other income, higher medical costs due to normalization,
pension cost adjustment, and a reduced labor cost capitalization due to lower loan volume.
Truist remains highly disciplined on core expenses. Average FTEs decreased 769 during the quarter and we
expect further reductions this year. We plan to close 104 branches in December and January, and are looking at
ways to bring forward more branch closures in 2021.
Turning to slide 13. Asset quality ratios remain relatively stable. The NPA ratio increased 1 basis point to 26 basis
points and the NPL ratio increased 2 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I loans. Annualized net
charge-offs relative to average loans and leases increased 3 basis points to 42 basis points. We took a $97
million PCD adjustment to net charge-offs. Excluding that, net charge-offs would have been 29 basis points.
The provision of $421 million exceeded net charge-offs of $326 million, increasing an allowance by $95 million.
The allowance was 1.91% of loans and leases, up for 1.81%. Coverage ratios remained strong at 4.52 times net
charge-offs and 5.22 times non-performing loans. A combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value
mark remains very robust at 2.76% of total loans.
Turning to slide 14. Our exposure to sensitive industries continues to decline to a low of 9.1% of loans held for
investment. Outstanding balances to sensitive industries decreased $2.2 billion to $27.9 billion. We continue to
closely monitor and manage our sensitive industry portfolios.
Turning to slide 15. The volume of loans with the accommodations have decreased significantly since June 30.
Approximately $692 million of commercial loans had an active activation at the end of September 30, down from

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
$21.2 billion; and consumer, $6.2 billion at active accommodation down from $11.3 billion. The declines reflect
expiration of the initial payment relief which was not renewed by the borrower. Since June 30, approximately 98%
of the commercial borrowers and 94.5% of the consumer borrowers who exited payment release either paid off
their balance or are in current status.
Turning to slide 16. The allowance for credit losses increased $96 million to reflect loan re-grading uncertainty
related to the expiration of government stimulus programs. Our economic assumptions include: extended GDP
recovering, high single-digit unemployment through mid-2021 followed by continued improvement through the
remaining reasonable and supportable forecast period. Our ACL estimate also reflects qualitative adjustments for
our model limitations, government stimulus, accommodations, and a review of SNC.
Turning to slide 17. Capital ratios improved for the second straight quarter and are strong relative to regulatory
requirements. Our reported CET1 ratio increased to 10% from 9.7% last quarter. We also issued $925 million of
preferred stock to strengthen our Tier 1 and total capital ratios. The recent assigned Stress Capital Buffer of 270
basis points will remain in effect until September when a revised Stress Capital Buffer will be provided. Next, we
plan to submit our capital plan in early November as required by the Federal Reserve. Our purpose of capital
priorities continue to be organic growth in our dividend. We remain open to bolt-on acquisitions with fee income
businesses.
Turning to slide 18. Liquidity remains strong with an LCR ratio of a 117% and liquid asset buffer of 18.6%. Our
access to secured funding sources is robust with over $200 billion of cash, securities and secured borrowing.
Parent company is sufficient to cover 22 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows.
Turning to slide 19. We continue to see strong growth in digital banking. Truist opened up 56,000 net new
accounts versus 15,000 last quarter; driven by digital and increased branch traffic. For the 12 months through
August, we experienced a 21% increase in digital sales, 8% increase in active mobile users, 23% increase in
mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. We are also proud of a recognition we
received recently from Javelin.
Heritage BB&T was recognized as a leader in Ease of Use and Financial Fitness in mobile banking and a leader
in Financial Fitness in online banking. Heritage SunTrust was recognized as a leader in Ease of Use and online
banking. These awards demonstrate the strength of our heritage platforms and the opportunities as Truist
advances digital capabilities.
Turning to slide 20. As we have said, our primary reason for the merger is to exceed client expectations through
seamless integration of touch and technology to create trust. To get there, we are harvesting cost saves from
combined companies to fund increased investment and ultimately drive best-in-class performance. We are fully
committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves and continue to make good progress on personnel expense,
corporate real estate, branch rationalization, third-party spend, and system decommissioning and data center
closures.
At the same time, we're also investing in digital marketing and technology. We are also investing in talent
including areas outside of digital and our revenue businesses. Together, these investments and cost saves will
allow us to generate best-in-class returns versus our peers, while providing distinctive, secure and successful
client experiences through touch and technology.
Now, I will provide our fourth quarter guidance, which is based on linked-quarter changes versus the third quarter.
For our guidance, [audio gap] (00:23:21) provides a path to positive operating leverage. We expect taxable

equivalent revenue excluding onetime security gains to be down 1% to 3% driven by lower purchase accounting
and accretion. We expect reported net interest margin to be down 3 basis points to 5 basis points due to lower
purchase accounting accretion and core margin to be relatively flat. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger
costs and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4% reflecting lower personnel expense. We also anticipate
net charge-offs to between 40 basis points and 60 basis points.
Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for our merger update, closing remarks, and Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl. If you follow along on slide 21, I would say to you generally, the merger is on track, integration and
conversion. We feel really good about where we are and making really great progress. Most importantly, our
culture is really strong. And I would say to you kind of interestingly that the COVID experience has actually
bonded our team together even faster than we would have expected because when you go through a really, really
tough time and you're kind of thrown on the boat together, it encourages all strength in terms of developing
relationship, trust and bonding. So, we could not feel better about how strong our culture is and how well it is
developing.
Some very notable activities in terms of the integration and conversion; we did complete the branch divestiture, as
I mentioned. We recently announced something we're very excited about, what we call, Truist Ventures. This is
where we were making relatively small but important investments in technology platforms that we can build into
our value proposition. We are testing now for our client conversions in wealth and mortgage which will come up in
the spring. So, there'll be a number of conversions that have occurred or will occur on the way toward the core
conversion. We did launch our dual service branch pilots. This is a technical thing, but it's very important as we
move down the road, as Daryl alluded to, in terms of accelerating our branch closings as we head into next year.
Very importantly, we did complete our end-to-end Truist Securities conversion. This was our big deal. As we know
this was the first virtual conversion that has occurred and it was seamless. Our people did a fantastic job and it's a
big deal because we're a really big securities operation now backing up our corporate and investment banking
business. Our core conversion is on track for the first half of 2022. So we feel good about where everything is with
regard to the integration and conversion.
If you look at slide 22, just a word about our value proposition as we wrap up. We are, as I said in the beginning,
driven by our purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. Our goal, long-term, is to grow
earnings with less volatility relative to our peers over the long-term. That's kind of a commitment we made to our
shareholders. We base that on a very exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets.
As we said, we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the US today that gives us scale to be able to compete.
We're very strong in our marketplace and that gives us the efficiencies that we need. We are the sixth largest
insurance broker. We have really strong growth there. I think we're going to report 5.3% organic growth which we
believe we're probably at the top in the market. We're the number one regional bank on investment firm. We're the
number two regional bank on mortgage originator and servicer, so very, very strong franchise.
We're really positioned well to be best-in-class in terms of efficiency and returns. At the same time, we'll be
investing heavily in the future. As Daryl said, we are confident in achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. At
the same time, we'll be investing in our revenue synergy operation. I will tell you that our IRM, our integrated
relationship management strategy is going great. As you know, in the beginning, we said there were huge
opportunities to leverage the strengths that SunTrust had and the strengths that BB&T had. And I would say that

it's ahead of schedule. The receptivity of our people with regard to cross-selling, if you will, these products and
services across the organization is robust, and frankly, there's just a lot of enthusiasm about it.
We are making key investments in technology, in our teammates, in marketing and in advertising, all of which will
drive our above average organic growth and long-term stable and growing profitability. At the same time, we have
a very strong capital base as you can see, very strong liquidity, and a very resilient risk profile. We are very
prudent and disciplined in risk and financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture.
We have very diversified benefits arising from the merger that will just kind of naturally implicit in the merger. We
stress test very well as you've seen. We have very strong capital, very strong liquidity and we have a very strong
and defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with CECL credit
reserves. So overall, I would say we have a great culture. We have a great franchise. We have a great team. And
I fully believe our best days are ahead. Ryan?

Daryl, I want to ask you a question on the expense side. Clear that your timing on the cost saves is on track from
a long-term perspective. Two pieces; number one, at what point do we see the incremental operating expenses
start to settle back down because they've been on a steady increase since September of last year. And then, two,
can you give us any update in terms of your expected realization of those cost saves as we kind of reset the bar
in a COVID world and understand like just your timing recognition of those cost saves? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Ken, what I would tell you is that we are still on the uptick in our merger and MoU-related expenses. We
are just going through the developing phases of that. Testing starts in the first quarter as we start with SIT testing
and then we go into UAT testing as we get ready for client they won in early part of 2022. So, I would say we're

still on the uptick there. To-date, since we announced the transaction in February 2019, we have about $1.5
billion of combined [ph] MERC (00:31:02) and MoU-related expenses. And at that time, we said we would be at
$2 billion. I don't have a number of what it is going. Yes, we will probably give that to you in January. We will
probably exceed that number sometime in the first quarter, the $2 billion number.
I want to give you a number and make sure we hit the number that I give you in our earnings call in January from
that standpoint. So we're coming through figuring all that out and we'll get back to you on that. But I would say
we'll still stay elevated for the next several quarters and we have thousands and thousands of people right now
working on hundreds of systems getting them ready, getting them tested. And we just got to make sure this is
flawless. I mean we have to be – have a great client experience, we have to make sure everything goes right that
cost a little bit of money.
You have to remember, Ken, on this we chose to choose the better of the two when we had our choices. We
didn't take the easy way out and just convert everything all one way or the other. So, for the commercial platform,
we chose to use the heritage BB&T Servicing System AFS coupled with the heritage SunTrust and CNO piece.
That takes a lot more time, a lot more complexity. But when we get it done, we will be so far better. We're doing it
in the retail banking platform as well where we have the BB&T heritage deposit system coupled with the heritage
SunTrust automated teller. Again, more complexity, but when we get through all this in 2022, we will be light years
ahead of most of our peers because of what we're doing from that. So, it's the right thing to do. It costs a lot of
money to do it. We're going to do it right and we're going to execute.

Got it. And one long-term question, I know that with the low-20s ROTCE, the outlook that you had previously was
pre-COVID. A lot of changes out there. Consensus for 2022 is obviously nowhere near it. Can you help us
understand like what you think is doable longer term? Obviously, the provision's a big input into that or at what
point do you think we can get some updated expectations on what's doable for this franchise? Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Ken, we still feel confident over the long-term and the original expectation of low-20s ROTCE. Remember, we're
already very, very strong in the environment that we're in today. And as Daryl described, we are really just getting
started in terms of getting the long-term investments made and the related expense reductions that will follow.
And then, of course, you got all the revenue synergies that I alluded to. So we feel very, very good about that.
Obviously, we'll ebb and flow some based on the economy but that's still a reasonable number to shoot for.

obviously saw the balance has dropped, but if you can give us any sort of sense on what the migration looks like
this quarter in some of those at-risk exposures? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Michael, I'll take the PCD question. Then I'll kick to Clarke and he can maybe answer the
accommodation piece of it. So, on the PCD, remember, when we closed in December, we closed under the, now
what I would say old accounting method where we had to set up PCI. When CECL came in into January, we went
from PCI to PCD. In that process, we went through, we grossed up loans and carrying values in connection with
the establishment of PCD of our best estimates.
As the year played out, what we realized is we grossed up the loans and we should have not grossed them up to
the full value. They should have been stayed charged-off from that perspective. So it was the adjustment that we
made this quarter. We think we've gone through the book and we've got everything there. So, in that sense, we
would have just had a different number in the first quarter when we got our CECL numbers, but it was an
adjustment that we made. It's a non-cash item and we had really good charge-offs. If you exclude that $29 million,
we had good charge-offs. Even if you add that in, that's $42 million; both big guidance.
Clarke?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl. Hey, Michael. As far as the sensitive industry you see on the slide there we've got in the deck, we
had a nice couple billion dollar reduction this quarter. It's been a very targeted effort to work with those borrowers
and to reduce the exposure. So, I would say, the highlights of the quarter there is we worked very aggressively to
get a handle on particularly in the energy portfolio and hospitality side.
We actually sold $300 million worth of hotel credits at pretty good pricing and also addressed a good bit of the
energy book. So, to give you some context, non-performers in that portfolio of sensitive industries are still less
than 100 basis points, and we have less than 2% of those balances that are in any kind of accommodation or
deferral. So, I consider really strong progress and we'll continue to watch that closely. And it's all considered in
our reserves as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe this is my follow-up; you guys hit 10% CET1. Obviously, buyback's on hold for
you and others this quarter. How should we think about capital deployment? Any updated thoughts that you guys
have would be appreciated. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Mike, we're really happy to be at 10%. And as you know, we've said that that was our target. So that's a very
comfortable position. As we think about it going forward, it's really a function of, of course, when we're actually
able to do buybacks and dividend increases. But the way we think about it is about risk projection. And so, if we
look forward and we feel like the economy is stabilized and growing, if we look forward in terms of the pandemic
and it's under control, and we can feel comfortable in terms of a projected relatively stable, less volatile, growing

revenue stream, then we'll feel comfortable in terms of turning back on buybacks and considering dividend
increases.
I'd say today it's just premature. We just don't know what we don't know. And if we go out there today and try to
make those kind of assumptions, I think, is just shooting in the dark. I do think as we head into next year, we'll see
clarity with regard to the pandemic. We'll see clarity with regard to the economy. As I said earlier, I think there's a
chance of the economy will be better [ph] than most things. (00:38:15) So, there's a decent chance we'll have that
decision to make as we head into the, let's call it, first half of next year, but today it's just a tad premature.

purchases to be able to [ph] hit that (00:39:12) higher net interest margin even though it was only 1 basis point?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Gerard, so our current duration of our portfolio, because our prepayment speeds picked up, were just a
tad over three years right now, 3.1 years. But they do have negative convexity. So, it can move in and out from
that perspective. What I would say is that we are in the midst of moving some more of our liquidity that we have at
the Fed. We have a little over $30 billion at the Fed. Currently, we are moving that over – some of it this quarter,
maybe more of it into early next year.
We are layering in some hedges. Now, I would tell you that hedges that we're putting on are pay fixed hedges.
We're buying mortgage back which, as you know, has cash flows that pay down over the life of those assets. The
way FASB has approved hedge accounting on this, it's only allowed to use bullet swaps. They do have a task
force that they are working on trying to look for other ways to allow for this. It's called last-of-layer hedging and
we're hopeful that we'll be able to put on a little stronger hedges. But the hedges we're putting on will mute some
of the OCI volatility.
If they come through and allow us to use maybe amortizing swaps instead of just bullet swaps, that would
significantly improve the performance of those hedges. So, we're hopeful about that. But we are trying to hedge it
the best that you can. Right now, the costs of these pay fixed swaps are really low, it's 12 basis points. So it
doesn't really impact it. So, we are in the midst of [indiscernible] (00:40:50).
Yeah. I always look at it as an opportunity cost right now. We could have lower rates for the next three years,
that's what's in the forecast; five years, you just don't know. And I think it's good to be deployed. The way I would
think of it though is that if rates were to go up or if we started to lose some of the surge deposits, our cash flows
from this investment portfolio [ph] we're voting (00:41:12) could be easily $10 billion a quarter. So, we could just
[ph] not (00:41:17) reinvest.
If we have strong loan growth, we could use that cash flow to deploy into loan growth. So it gives us a lot more
flexibility, a lot more optionality and it also helps protect our margin and help run rate. You pay us to run our
company and do what we think is best. We think this is a good balanced approach to managing the company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And as a follow-up, Kelly, I share your view about the vaccine for this COVID and the therapeutics that
we'll have next year, and hopefully the economy really starts to open up. I want to come back to something you
said about the small business owners. And if the economy doesn't come back, there could be some real
meaningful fallout.
Can you kind of frame for us – and I know it's subjective – but can you frame for us when does – if the economy
doesn't come back by the second quarter or the first quarter, when do you really start to get concerned about that
fallout?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, Gerard, that's something obviously we don't know. But I think today, that – some, of course, have already
gone away. I mean, they couldn't – for whatever reason, they couldn't qualify for the stimulus. They chose not to,
they just threw in the towel. But that's a small percentage. Most have been buoyed by the stimulus [ph] or

(00:42:37) PPP and other loan assistance programs. As that begins to phase out, these businesses will have
tougher decisions to make.
But I'll tell you that a lot of these small businesses are pretty creative and they're pretty resilient. And so, I mean I
wouldn't expect to see a majority of small businesses fold or anywhere close to that. I think most are going to find
ways to reinvent their business. It's incredible how smart small business people are [indiscernible] (00:43:07)
basically my whole career. And they're a pretty tough group. So, I wouldn't write them off. I'm just saying that, it
ain't gone into the second quarter and [ph] consensus (00:43:18) is out and consumers aren't back out buying
again, and we will see a shakeout. But here's the thing today, consumer purchases are back up.
And if you look at credit card activity, I mean it's up year-over-year. So it went through a trough [indiscernible]
(00:43:35) year-over-year. So, they're buying – there's buying in different ways. So what these small businesses
have to do is figure out what this carry-out or dine-out in the backyard or whatever it is if you're in restaurant. The
creative ones will figure it out. Some won't be able to figure it out, and they'll have to find another career. But I
think that all will begin to be clearer, Gerard, as we head into the second quarter.

Hi. Just on credit, just a couple – two-part question there. First on the delinquencies, looks like both 90-plus days
and 30 to 89 days increased. Just want to get some color what you're seeing beginning to migrate, if there's any
concentration there, what's driving that? And then separately on the loan loss reserve, if we do see the
delinquency, you start to interpret into a steady rise in charge-offs. Is it fair to assume, as charge-offs rise that
you're adequately reserved and accordingly you could see the reserve-to-loan ratio decline as that happens?
Thanks.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Hi, John. This is – yeah, this is Clarke. I'll answer that, John. On the delinquency side, we typically see in
consumer anyway some elevated early stage, as you go through the second half of the year. So, third quarter is
going up a little bit, part of that's seasonal. You'll see a lot of it's concentrated in the government guaranteed
portfolios around student and mortgage. So if you take that out particularly for your 90-plus days, that was the
majority there; it was flat otherwise. So again, nothing alarming at this point. We anticipate part of that each year.
And to your second question, all of that is considered as we go through our modeling and our allowance and our
view of the scenarios that we selected. So yes, I think we'd assume there will be further deterioration as we move
forward. This is very likely, and that's all been included in our estimate to-date.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the noninterest margin front. I know that you indicated that –
Daryl, that the reported margin should see some slight pressure through the remainder of the year. I just want to
get your thoughts on the core margin outlook, just given some of the actions you've taken and how you're thinking
about that from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I would tell you, we had a good drop in deposit costs this past quarter, but we still think we have room to
go there. So our interest-bearing costs are [ph] 15 basis points (00:46:35). My guess is, over the next quarter or
two, we'll be single digits. I think that's just the direction that we're headed right now. I think that's a possibility. I
think that will help. I think as we can grow some of our consumer portfolios successfully, that will help mitigate
some of our core margins. We have higher yields in those portfolios, and that would definitely help as we're able
to be successful in growing that.
And the other thing I would just tell you is that, we are doing everything we can to protect our core margin and try
to grow as much as we can to offset the runoff. But the runoff for purchase accounting is a little bit – it's hard to
predict. It depends on how the loans pay down on that. My guess right now is that it'll be down 3% to 5% right
now, but you really don't know what's going to come through from that. You just have to do the best that you can
with what's running off from that.
But with PPP coming out over the next couple quarters, that will help keep core margin probably in the 270s and
that will help mitigate the reduction of gap to what depending how much you get PPP to pay down. Now, our
guess is the bulk of our pay downs will come in the first quarter, maybe second quarter. We'll get some this
quarter. Recall, our company has about $12.5 billion of PPP loans on the books.
We are planning to have invitations sent to all of our clients in the month of November, so they'll all get invitations.
How quickly they can respond with the documentation and we submit it to SBA is just a huge process. That's why
we're thinking it's more centered in the first half of 2021 [ph] and (00:48:24) in this quarter. But you don't really
know; it's an unknown right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, couple other things. Keep in mind that our people have been very successful in terms of floors with regard to
new loans and existing renewals. The other thing is that, if the economy comes back faster which I think it may,
there's going to be a substantial pent-up demand for expansions. And so, we will see an increase in loan demand

for, I'd call it, normally price loans which will be a plus with regard to NIM. So, couple of things could really help us
on NIM in addition to what Daryl said.

Hi. Hi. Good morning. Okay. A couple of questions. One is on how you think about the reserve release? I know it's
early to ask this question, but we all model out a couple of years. So I'm just trying to understand what your
thought process is with regard to when you would start to release reserves? Is it to match any net charge-offs that
you get from here? Or maybe there's something else you're thinking about you could let us in on? Thanks.

you'll see in our estimate this quarter. We've been I think prudent around considering there's still a lot of economic

uncertainty around it whether there'll be any more stimulus, what the ultimate outcome of these accommodations
are and just pace of the recovery. So, I think for us – we would want to be sure we have much better clarity there
and see the economy on very firm ground and the client performance fee at a really strong level, before I think
you'd see us consider releases.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

[indiscernible] (00:50:52)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Just [ph] one other thing that would (00:50:53) be kind interesting. But to your point, if everything were precise as
I understand it, the economy was performing as we expected in terms of our safer projections. Rates are as we
projected. So our net present value analysis is the same what we project. If all of that would happen, it'd be 100%
correlation between reserve and projections and [indiscernible] (00:51:17). But as Clarke said, it's not going to be
100% correlation.
And the other thing is – and I hope this is not true, but do we get any pressure from regulators to hold reserves up
even though all the math and all the concepts there should be coming down. We've not heard anything about that,
but that's always a lot more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So how does that work with CECL, as my follow-up question. I know maybe that's a little bit longer than the
time you want to spend on it on this topic. But the question really is around how to think about the trajectory of the
reserves from here like in the old incurred loss model. There was some general reserve that you could have.
And I'm just wondering, as we go through this recession and we have – maybe some asset classes are
experiencing greater than expected loss, others less than expected loss. Can you shift the reserves around? And
the question really ends up being how fungible are the reserves that you put up against these specific asset
classes that you've identified. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Clarke, I'll start, if you want to maybe add to it. But I mean, we do it both ways, Betsy, and that we do a bottom-up
analysis. So, our modelers go through and remodel all of the portfolios and we run it against the scenarios and we
come up with a bottom-up analysis. Given the limitations of the models and the uncertainty in the environment,

there's always top down adjustments that occur that are basically in play there. So, it's really – it's a process you
go through. You have to know what you have in the models today.
If the economy gets better and everything else stays the same, you could see a release potentially. But that's not
reality. Things are always changing, things are always getting re-rated up and down in the portfolio, client
behaviors are changing, more charge-offs or whatever. So, it's always a dynamic process. I think Clarke and his
team do a great job in analyzing it. We thoroughly review it several times before we come up with our numbers
each quarter. So, it's hard to predict right now especially with the uncertainty how high the economic variables are
today and the model limitations out there. There's a lot of qualitative adjustments occurring right now. Clarke?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
No, no. I think you said it well, Daryl. I think it's very granular by segment. And that segment analysis and our view
of the economy and the impact on all of that does allow us to adjust the estimate as needed. And so, you could
have differences quarter-to-quarter by those different segments and that could impact the level of the estimate.

Operator: Yeah. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. My question goes to slide 12, where the efficiency trends have not gone on the right direction the last couple
of quarters, but you just gave guidance for that to improve in the fourth quarter. You talked about personnel
savings, CRE, branch, third party systems, and closing 104 branches. So I think I'm summarizing what I heard.
So my question is, why not more, why not faster? This is one of the biggest merger overlaps that you've seen.
You're allowed to close branches starting in December. Yesterday, U.S. Bancorp said they're going to close 300
branches and you just said you're going to close about 100 branches. It just seems like you could do a lot more,
and are you just being too safe to get the merger integration smooth? I mean, you are growing deposits, no blow-
ups, and I'm sure you're protecting a long-term franchise. But I thought that efficiency story would be coming in a
little sooner than it's come in. Thanks.

Yeah. So Michael, I'll start with that and others can help me finish the answer. So, I'll start with – we have five-
plus sets of cost savings. You started with the branch system. So we are closing 104 branches, as I said in my
prepared remarks, in December-January timeframe. I also said that we're looking at opportunities to pull forward
from other branch closures in 2021. We aren't at the stage yet to announce exactly what we're going to do there.
But we did give you an indication that there is a possibility and we wouldn't have said that if it wasn't a strong
reality that we're going to pull forward a significant piece of some branch closures in 2021. We'll give you that
once we are able to do that.
If you look at our third-party spend or third-party providers, to-date right now with dealing with vendors, our
sourcing and procurement teams have basically realized $266 million of savings from that. We think that run rate
translates into about $300 million in 2021. They are not at their goals yet. They're still trying to get more savings.
We think that will occur over the next year or so. We hope those numbers will exceed $400 million before it's all
said and done from a run rate perspective. As contracts come up, as we redeploy, we're still going through the
process of negotiating contracts with an end provider of these services that we are having right now. So, not
everything can be fully negotiated yet.
Next one would be on our non-branch facilities. We talked about that in our last earnings call. We have 29 million
square feet outstanding if you add branches and non-branches out there. We talked about potentially taking 5
million square feet out in our non-branch areas this next year. We said the average cost of that on a gross basis
was $30 a square foot. There'll be a little bit investment come back as we refit under the socially distance areas
and all that for the buildings that are surviving. We have branches that will probably have another 2 million square
feet to 3 million square feet there. So, there'll be close to 20 million square feet probably by the end of 2021 in our
company from that perspective. So [ph] at the third that we're taking (00:57:46) out very aggressively, very
quickly.
The fourth area is in technology. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're just now getting in the midst of
getting through conversions. We've done some small conversions, not client facing, and we've started a
decommissioned systems, starting to get systems there. We just did the conversion in Beau's area in the capital
markets, large corporate area and all that stuff. So, those savings are going to be captured.
As we get through conversions in the first quarter and Joe's area with wealth and broker-dealer that we have
there [ph] and the – in that, (00:58:20) one's in first quarter, the other one's in second quarter. It takes probably
three to six months before we get through and get those systems decommissioned. Scott has plans to – we don't
need four data centers right now. We're going to end up with a couple of data centers at the end of the day. That
will probably be a 2022 saving. So, we will get those savings. It's just a matter of when we are able to get those
close and get everything transferred.
And the last one on personnel. If you look at our FTEs, every quarter, they've been falling in FTEs. And we pulled
forward FTEs. As we go through these conversions, we're going to have continued FTE closures. I mean, we
don't need as much of the areas on the support side as we go through these conversions and get things finalized.
So, there's a lot to come. We're not backing down from the $1.6 billion. We aren't backing down from the timing.
We're going to come through on target like we said we were, and this is just a way of doing it.

And Mike, just to amplify. Your question is a good one. It's appropriate about the branches. But two points. Up to
this point, we have been cautious in terms of closing branches because we want to have – wanted to have
maximum availability for our clients. Keep in mind that we had to basically close down the lobbies. And we're
fortunate about 98-plus-percent of our branches have drive-throughs, so our drive-throughs have been open
throughout for the last several months. We've had in-branch activity based on appointments only. We just opened
up this week like 1,500 branches full service in the lobby.
So, once we get the branches back to kind of normal and our client service capabilities back to normal, then we
will be more aggressive in terms of the closings, because we have a large number of branches that are literally
side to side, actually in many cases, sharing the same parking lot. And our people, like Daryl alluded, are literally
in the process of developing aggressive plan with regard to that. So, don't hear us say we're not going to be
aggressive with regard to branch closures, but we're not just going to announce it today because they're literally in
the process of putting the final touches on what it's going to look like.

And then one follow-up, just to put a bow around it. How much in merger cost savings do you have so far in the
third quarter run rate? And what do you expect for 2021 and 2022 again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, for the third quarter we're probably around 35%, give or take. We're still targeting 40% in the fourth quarter.
The guidance that we gave is in the middle of that range that I gave you there. So we're plus or minus on that side
of that. For the end of fourth quarter of 2021, we're still at 65% of the $1.6 billion and then the whole $1.6 billion
by the end of 2022. So, we are not changing the timing of that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Following up a little bit on NII. Daryl, what is embedded in your fourth quarter core NIM –
reported NIM guidance for PPP forgiveness, if anything? And can you just remind us or give us an update as to
what you are thinking right now for forgiveness rates over I would say maybe I guess the next three quarters? And

any color on what the sort of the fee rate is on that forgiveness? Because obviously it does move the needle a bit
on NII with that accelerated forgiveness.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, what I would say – and we talked about this last quarter, now, our estimate hasn't really changed and
that we still think 75% of it will pay off with this forgiveness piece. That's a guesstimate. We really don't know. We
are, like I said earlier, sending invitations out to everybody [ph] from that. (01:02:32) For this fourth quarter, of that
75%, we're probably around 20%. That's a shot in the dark of what actually might get paid off. We really don't
know the timing. If you look at the news that came out last week from the SBA and the two-pager for the $50,000
or less, the numbers on that is, out of our 80,000 clients we have 45,000 clients that are $50,000 or less, but it
only represents 7% of the dollars. So, it's a huge volume piece.
So, hopefully a lot of that – most of that will probably get processed very quickly. But we've actually gone through
and done some forgiveness on a limited basis just to learn the process, and we've actually gotten paid from the
SBA on a couple. So, we're learning and gearing up and we're getting ready to do it holistically out to everybody
at once, once we got the processes all lined up. So, we're gearing up for that.
We think the first quarter, Saul, will be our biggest quarter. Right now, the estimates are around 60% and the rest
would be in the second quarter. But you really don't know when the timing of it is. It's a pure shot in the dark, but
that's what's in our numbers right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. And I know it's more tilted towards first quarter. But does your fourth quarter guidance explicitly incorporate
that 20% forgiveness and certain fee rate on top of that? I know I'm getting a little bit nit-picky here, but
[indiscernible] (01:04:08)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
[ph] Hey, you're right. (01:04:08) There is risk. I mean, if it's less than 20%, we may miss core. If it's more than
20%, we may exceed core. But that won't be the only end all be all on core [ph] reported (01:04:20) there are a lot
of other variables. But that is an assumption that plays out absolutely there.
The other thing you have to think about, Saul, is when can you realize it. Just because somebody sends it in, did
you realize it when they send it in or when they actually get the dollars wired back into us? So we're working with
our external auditors on the timing of when we'll recognize that fee pay-off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Without PPP forgiveness, can you maintain core NIM flat or is it pretty much impossible to do that given the
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
My guess is that the core margin without PPP is probably in the high-2.60s right now would be my guess, maybe
still 2.70. I mean, we are – it all depends on what Kelly said; the loan growth, the ability to grow the higher yielding

portfolios, and really get a mix change. If we could just mix, invest some of the excess liquidity that we have in
loans versus securities or fed balances, that's a really positive way to help your core margin. It's just a matter of
trying to get the loan volume to support that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just one final quick, just absolutely just want to make sure. The guidance for expenses and revenue, that is based
on the adjusted noninterest expense number $3.147 billion and incorporates the adjusted noninterest income, I
guess, of $2.106 billion. Just want to clarify that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. In my prepared remarks, I adjusted both the expense side and the revenue side.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, just want to make sure. Thank you.
