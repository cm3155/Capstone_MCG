Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Western Alliance's third quarter earnings call. Joining me on
the call today are Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer. I will
provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic
environment, and then Dale will walk you through the bank's financial performance. Afterwards, we will open the
line to take your questions.
I'd like to focus on three trends that define our third quarter results and will continue into the future: robust balance
sheet growth, provision reflecting asset quality and consensus outlook, and strong net interest income and PPNR
that continue to build capital. The combination of these variables generated record net income of $135.8 million
and EPS of $1.36, each up more than 45% versus the prior quarter and exceeding our pre-pandemic
performance in 2019.
The flexibility of Western Alliance's diversified business model was again demonstrated this quarter as our deep
segment and product expertise enable us to actively adapt our business in response to the changing environment
and continue to achieve industry-leading profitability and growth while maintaining prudent credit risk
management.
Total loans grew $985 million for the quarter to $26 billion and deposits increased $1.3 billion to $29 billion,
reducing our loan to deposit ratio to 90.2%. Our loan growth continues to be concentrated in low loss asset
classes such as warehouse lending which accounted for over 100% of the loan growth and 56% of the deposit
growth, and $267 million in capital call lines where the risk/reward equation is heavily skewed in our favor.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
The impact of this strategy will be seen near term in our reduced provisioning expense and longer term in lower
net charge-offs. We are encouraged by our expanding pipeline as clients have applied lessons learned from prior
recessions to rightsize cost structures and to begin to plan for future opportunities.
In the quarter, high average interest-earning assets of $1.9 billion were offset by lower rates, substantial liquidity
build, and a onetime adjustment to PPP loan fee recognition to reflect modification and extension of the CARES
Act forgiveness timeframe, which pushed our net interest margin downward to 3.71% as net interest income
declined $13.7 million from the second quarter to $285 million but improved $18.3 million from a year-ago period.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, net interest income would have only fallen by $4 million, which is largely the
impact of interest expense on our new subordinated debt issued in middle of the second quarter. We believe
approximately 21 basis points of this compression is transitory in nature, and NIM is expected to rise as excess
liquidity is put to work through balance sheet growth, deposit seasonality and warehouse lending driving balances
lower, and PPP loan forgiveness assumptions normalize. Given these margin trends and balance sheet growth,
we believe Q4's net interest income performance returns to Q2 levels, and PPNR rises above Q3.
Provision for credit losses was $14.7 million in the third quarter, considerably less than the $92 million in the
second quarter, which was primarily attributable to stable to modest improvements in macroeconomic forecast
assumptions, loan growth in low-risk asset classes and limited net charge-offs of $8.2 million or 13 basis points of
average assets. Dale will go into more detail on the specific drivers of our provision, but our total loan ACL to
funded loans ratio now stands at 1.37% or $355 million and 1.46% excluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by
the CARES Act.
If macroeconomic trends remain stable or begin to improve, future provision expense will likely mirror net charge-
offs and reserve levels could decline. Loan deferrals trended lower for the quarter as many of our clients have
returned to paying as agreed following their deferral period. As of Q3, $1.3 billion of loans are on deferral or 5% of
the total portfolio, which represents a 55% decline from Q2. We expect $1.1 billion of loan deferrals will expire
next quarter, which will continue to drive down our outstanding modifications.
Our quarterly efficiency ratio improved to 39.7% compared to 43.2% from a year-ago period. Becoming more
efficient during the economic uncertainty provides the incremental flexibility to maintain PPNR.
Finally, Western Alliance continues to generate significant excess capital which grew tangible book value per
share to $29.03 or 4.3% over the previous quarter and 13.4% year-over-year. Supported by our robust PPNR
generation, capital rose $121.6 million with a CET1 ratio of 10% supporting 15.6% annualized loan growth.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Thanks, Ken. Over the last three months, Western Alliance generated record net income of $135.8 million or
$1.36 per share, which is up 46% on a linked-quarter basis. As Ken mentioned, net income benefited from
reduction in provision expense for credit losses of $14.7 million primarily driven by stability in the economic
outlook during the quarter and a release of specific reserves associated with a fully resolved credit.
Net interest income grew $18.3 million year-over-year to $284.7 million but declined $13.7 million during the
quarter primarily a result of changes in prepayment assumptions on PPP loans that impacted fee accretion

recognition. The SBA's interim final rule published in August more than doubled the amount of time that people
have to receive forgiveness on their loans, and coupled with the systems delay in forgiveness request processing,
we now expect debt forgiveness processes to be elongated and the average time the loans will be outstanding is
projected to double as well.
As a result, using the effective interest method, we reversed out $6.4 million of the fees recognized in Q2 and
overall PPP fee recognition has been extended. This is purely a change in timing impacting NIM but with no
change to cumulative fee revenue ultimately recognized from this program. The $43 million we are to receive will
simply be booked to income more slowly than our original expectations. Net interest income was impacted in Q3
as a result of this timely change by $10.6 million.
Noninterest income fell $700,000 to $20.6 million from the prior quarter. We benefited from a recovery of an
additional $5 million mark-to-market loss on preferred stocks that we recognized in the first quarter. Over the last
two quarters, we recovered 80% of that $11 million original loss.
Finally, noninterest expense increased $9.3 million as the deferral of loan origination costs fell as PPP loan
originations dropped, as well as an increase in incentive accruals as our third quarter performance exceeded our
original third quarter budget, which was established before the pandemic. Strong ongoing balance sheet
momentum coupled with diligent expense management drove pre-provision net revenue to $181.3 million, up
13.5% year-over-year and consistent with our overall growth trend from the first quarter as the second quarter
benefited from onetime PPP recognition [ph] above (00:10:52) restructuring in FAS 91 loan cost deferrals.
Turning now to net interest drivers. Investment yields decreased 23 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.79%,
and fell 29 basis points from the prior year due to the lower rate environment. Loan yields decreased 35 basis
points following declines across most loan types, mainly driven by changing loan mix and in the reduction of PPP
loan fees resulting in lower PPP loan yield during the quarter.
Notably, for both investments and loans, spot rates as of September 30 are higher than the third quarter average
yields. Cost of interest-bearing deposits was reduced by 9 basis points in Q3 to 31 basis points with an end-of-
quarter spot rate of 27 basis points as we continue to lower posted deposit rates and push out higher cost [ph]
exception priced funds (00:11:48).
The spot rate for total deposits, which includes noninterest-bearing deposits, was 15 basis points. When all of the
company's funding sources are considered, total funding costs declined by 2 basis points, with an end-of-quarter
spot rate of 25 basis points. Unlike last quarter where spot rates indicated a likely margin compression in the third
quarter, these rates appear to demonstrate that the margin will improve as both earning asset yields will rise and
funding costs will fall in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in October, we called $75 million of subordinated debt that
has diminishing capital treatment with a current rate of 3.4%.
Despite the transition to a substantially lower rate environment during 2020, net interest income increased 6.9%
year-over-year to $284.7 million. As mentioned earlier, during Q3, our extraordinary build in liquidity and
adjustments to PPP loan fee recognition compressed our net interest margin to 3.71% as net interest income
declined $13.7 million. However, the majority of these reduction drivers are transitory.
PPP loans reduced our NIM during the quarter by 13 basis points. This changes the prepayment assumptions,
reduced SBA fees recognized, resulting in PPP loan yield of 1.76%. Excluding this timing difference, net interest
income declined only $4 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to interest expense on the new subordinated
debt that we issued last May, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.84%.

Referring to the bar chart on the lower left section of the page, of the $43 million in total PPP loan fees net of
origination cost that we received, only $3.3 million was recognized in the third quarter. We recognized reversal of
PPP of $6.4 million in Q3 and expect fee recognition to be approximately $6.9 million in the fourth quarter, and
taper off as prepayments and forgiveness are realized. In reality, these assumptions are dependent on actual
forgiveness from the SBA.
Additionally, average excess liquidity relative to loans increased $1.3 million in the quarter, the majority of which
are held at the Federal Reserve Bank earning minimal returns, which impacted NIM by approximately 21 basis
points in aggregate. Given our healthy loan pipeline and ability to deploy these funds to higher-yielding earning
assets, we expect this margin drag to dissipate in the coming quarters.
Regarding efficiency, on a linked-quarter basis, our efficiency ratio increased to 39.7% as we continue to invest in
our business to support future growth opportunities. As described earlier, the noninterest expense increase is
largely related to a net increase in compensation cost as we now have greater confidence in our ability to execute
on our pre-pandemic budget and are no longer benefiting from deferred costs for PPP loan originations.
Excluding PPP net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been 40.7% which, as we
indicated last quarter, should be moving closer to our historical levels in the low-40s. Return on assets increased
44 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.66% while provisions fell. PPNR ROA decreased 47 basis points to
2.22 as it track the decline in margin from the prior quarter. This continued strong performance in capital
generation provides us significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions or
meet our credit demands.
Our strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $985 million to $26 billion
and deposit growth of $1.3 billion brought our total deposit balance to $22.8 billion at quarter end. Inclusive of
PPP, both loans and deposits grew approximately 29% year-over-year with our focus on low loss segments and
DDA. The loan to deposit ratio decreased to 90.2% from 90.9% in Q2 as our strong liquidity position continues to
provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs.
Our cash position remains elevated at $1.4 billion at quarter end compared to $2.1 billion quarterly average as
deposit growth continues to outpace loan originations. While this doesn't pay our margin near term, we believe it
provides us inventory for selective credit growth as demand resumes.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $1.19 over the prior quarter to $29.03, an increase of $3.43 or
13.4% over the past 12 months. The vast majority of the $985 million of loan growth was driven by increases in
C&I loans of $892 million, supplemented by construction loan increases of $103 million. Residential and
consumer loans now comprise 9.3% of our portfolio, while construction loan concentration remains flat at 8.8% of
total loans.
Within the C&I growth for the quarter, and highlighting our focus on low-risk assets that Ken mentioned, capital
call lines grew $267 million, mortgage warehouse loans grew over $1 billion, and corporate finance loans
decreased $141 million this quarter. Residential loan originations were offset by higher prepayment activity
leaving the balance fairly flat.
We continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to
our firm's long-term value creation. Notably, year-over-year deposit growth of $6.4 million (sic) [$6.4 billion] is
higher than the annual deposit growth in any previous calendar year. Deposits grew $1.3 billion or 4.7% in the
6

third quarter, driven by increases in noninterest-bearing DDA of $777 million, which now comprise over 45% of
our deposit base, plus growth in the savings and money market accounts of $752 million.
Market share gains in mortgage warehouse and robust activity in Tech & Innovation continue to be significant
drivers of deposit growth. As we initially described on our Q1 earnings call, WAL's unique credit risk management
strategy is focused on establishing individual borrower-level strategies and direct customer dialogue to develop
long-term financial plans.
Our approach to payment deferral requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients, along with
assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests. We ask our clients to work with us
hand in hand, whereby our clients contribute liquidity, capital or equity as an integral component to modify
prepayment plans.
Our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower, government, and the bank's balance sheet to
develop solutions that extend beyond the six-month window provided for in the CARES Act. By quarter end,
deferrals had declined by $1.6 billion or 55%, reducing total loan deferrals from 11.5% at Q2 to 5%. Excluding the
Hotel Franchise Finance segment in which we executed a unique sector-specific deferral strategy, the bank-wide
deferral rate is approximately 1.6%. We have received minimal additional request for further deferrals and 98% of
clients with expired deferrals are now current in payments.
We expect $1.1 billion of loan deferrals will expire in the current quarter, which will substantially drive down
outstanding modifications. Consistent with this trend, as of yesterday, deferrals are down $420 million in October,
bringing the current total to $880 million.
Regarding asset quality, our nonperforming assets and OREO ratio remained flat at 47 basis points to total
assets, while total classified assets increased $28 million or 4 basis points to 98 basis points to total assets.
Classified accruing loans rose by $21 million explainable by a few loans 90 days past due as of September 30. All
of these loans are now current.
Special mention loans increased $81 million during the quarter to 1.83% to funded loans, which is a result of our
credit mitigation strategy to early identify, elevate, and apply heightened monitoring to loans and segments
impacted by the current COVID environment. Over 60% of the increase in special mention loans are from
previously identified segments uniquely impacted by the pandemic such as the hotel portfolio and a component of
our Corporate Finance division credits determined to have some level of repayment dependency on travel, leisure
or entertainment.
As we have discussed in the past, special mention loans are not predictive of future migration to classified or loss.
Essentially, over the past five years, less than 1% has moved through charge-offs. If borrowers do not have
through-cycle liquidity and cash and capital plans, we downgrade to substandard immediately to remediate.
Our total allowance for credit losses rose a modest $7 million from the prior quarter due to improvement in
macroeconomic forecast and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates. Additionally, we
covered $8.2 million of net charge-offs. The ending allowance related to loan losses was $355 million.
For CECL, we are using a consensus economic forecast outlook of blue-chip forecasters as it tracks
management's view of the recession and recovery. The economic forecast improved during the quarter which
would have implied a reserve release. However, given the still unknown time horizon of COVID impacts, political

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
uncertainty, and the unknown status of further stimulus, we adjusted our scenario weightings to a less optimistic
outlook.
In all, total loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans declined a modest 2 basis points to 1.37% or 1.46%
when excluding PPP loans. On a more granular level, our low loss segments account for approximately one-third
of our portfolio and include mortgage warehouse, residential and HOA lending, capital call lines, and resort
lending. When we exclude these segments, the ACL to funded loans on the remainder of the portfolio is 2%.
Provision expense decreased to $14.7 million for Q3 driven by loan growth in lower loss segments and improved
macroeconomic factors, while fully covering charge-offs. Net credit losses of $8.2 million or 13 basis points of
average loans were recognized during the quarter compared to $5.5 million in Q2. Relative to other banking
companies, our lower consumer exposure continues to result in much lower total loan losses.
We continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common
equity to total assets of 8.9%, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10%, a decrease of 20 basis points during the
quarter due to our strong loan growth. Excluding PPP loans, TCE to tangible assets is 9.3%, a modest decline of
10 basis points from the first quarter.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payments of $0.25 per share, our tangible book value per share rose
$1.19 in the quarter to $29.03, up 13.4% in the past year. We continue to grow our tangible book value per share
rapidly as it is increased 3 times that of peers over the last 5.5 years.
And I'll turn the call back to Ken to conclude with comments on a few of our specific portfolios.

I would now like to briefly update you on our credit risk mitigation efforts and the current status of a few exposures
to industries generally considered to be the most impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the quarter, Tim
Bruckner and the Credit Administration team led ongoing focused portfolio reviews by risk segment to monitor
credit exposures and performance against cash budgets, operating plans to the liquidity trough.
We are not waiting for deferrals to run out to make great changes or affect remediation strategies. If borrowers
are not performing against defined operating plans or determined to not have a sufficient through-cycle liquidity,
we downgrade them now to substandard and enact remediation strategies to ensure the best outcomes.
We do not hold loans in SMs, special mention, for a time to eventually downgrade. And as a result, special
mention-graded loans slowly migrate to classified or substandard. These facts and daily conversations with our
people and our clients help me feel confident that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively
manage our risk segments is bearing fruit and puts Western Alliance in a strong position to come out on the other
side of the pandemic in better shape than our peers.
In our $500 million gaming book focused on off-strip middle market gaming-linked companies, total deferrals were
reduced from 37% of the portfolio to only 4%. And as of today, it's 0 as our clients are now open for business and
are performing at or above their reopening plans. The $1.3 billion investor dependent portion of our Technology &
Innovation segment has continued to benefit from significant sponsor support for technology firms best positioned
to succeed in this COVID environment and an active fundraising environment as well.

Since March 2020, 65 of our clients have raised over $1.7 billion in capital, resulting in 87% of borrowers with
greater than six months remaining liquidity, up from 77% in Q1. Our CRE retail book of $674 million focused on
local personal services-based retail centers with no destination mall exposure continues to modestly exceed
national trends that shows rent collections rising from 50% in May to 80% in August. Similarly, this put – the
portfolio's deferrals have fallen from $176 million to $31 million.
Lastly, our $2.1 billion Hotel Franchise Finance business focused on select service hotels with greater financial
flexibility and LTVs at origination of approximately 60% continues to trend towards stabilization. Occupancy rates
are tracking national averages currently around 50%, which have tripled from April lows. At approximately 55%
occupancy, select service hotels are estimated to cover advertising debt service so a typical hotel is operating at
breakeven.
Furthermore, we have seen deferrals declined from 83% of the portfolio to 44% of the portfolio. And currently, we
do not anticipate granting any additional deferrals in the hotel portfolio. We are proactively engaging with hotel
sponsors to validate ongoing support and hotel performance against operating plans. As mentioned earlier, we
are not waiting for deferrals to end before migrating to ensure remediation options. With strong sponsor support,
the worst a [ph] grade (00:28:06) hotel typically receives is SM or special mention.
We just finished up with our management outlook. We believe that our third quarter performance is the baseline
for future balance sheet and earnings growth. With this record quarter, we beat our quarterly budget that was
established pre-pandemic. Our pipelines are strong and we expect loan growth to return to previously anticipated
levels of $600 million to $800 million for the next several quarters in low-risk asset classes. However, there will be
some offsets as PPP loans pay off or are forgiven. Depending on timing of the realized PPP forgiveness, organic
loan growth should more than offset PPP runoff.
In Q4, we expect to see the seasonal declines associated with our mortgage warehouse clients. Therefore,
deposit growth will be at the lower end of the target range reducing our excess liquidity. To supplement our
residential lending initiative, we acquired Galton Funding, a residential mortgage platform that specializes in the
acquisition of prime non-agency residential home loans. The acquisition is a low-risk, low-cost entry point to build
a meaningful residential mortgage business line at an accelerated timeframe with over 100 additional mortgage
originator relationships. We anticipate that the Galton team will be fully integrated by the end of October and be
contributing to loan growth by the end of the year.
As Dale mentioned, our current spot rates indicate that the net interest margin pressure experienced this quarter
will subside and net interest margin will trend upwards towards 3.9% in Q4. We expect net interest income to rise
in Q4 aided by both an increased NIM and higher end-of-quarter loan balances compared to the quarterly
average.
Additionally, it is expected that PPP fee income will pick up next quarter as forgiveness is granted. This will
however abate during 2021. PPNR is expected to increase as net interest income growth will more than offset any
increase in noninterest expense. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in new product offerings and
infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency. But Q2 and Q3 efficiency ratios are temporary and will eventually
return to a sustainable level in the low-40s.
Our long-term asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by economic consensus forecast, which if
consistent going forward could imply reserve releases in the coming quarters. We believe that the provisions in
excess of charge-offs year-to-date are more than sufficient to cover charge-offs through the cycle as we do not
see any indicators than imply material losses are on the horizon.

Finally, Western Alliance is one of the most prolific capital generators in the industry. Our strong capital base and
access to ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of any market dislocations to maintain leading risk-
adjusted returns to address any future credit demands, all while maintaining flexibility to improve shareholder
returns.
At this time, Dale, I and Tim will take your questions. Operator, if you want to open up the line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question
comes from Brad Milsaps of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Morning, Brad.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale or Ken, I just wanted to make sure I understood kind of all the moving parts around the balance sheet. It
sounds like a lot of the growth that you saw at the end of the quarter was mortgage warehouse related, which can
obviously be very volatile into the quarter, can vary given the average. As you go into the fourth quarter, is your
expectation that you're going to be able to replace that if it does wane a little bit with other types of loan growth?
You also mentioned that you also just expect deposits from that, from the warehouses to go down so you'll get
some liquidity bleed there as well. Just want to understand kind of what the moving parts would be within average
earning assets as you go into 4Q with kind of everything we've talked about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, mortgage warehouse had a great quarter as you can see by the results. They are increasing market
share simultaneously as our warehouse lending clients increase their activity or see increased activity. So we're
getting a two for one and that's why you saw the increase, the large increase in loan balances this quarter. Q4 is
traditionally a little lighter, and so we're just sticking to our Q4 analysis or historical viewpoint that loan growth
there will be less. And yes, our model is designed such that we can replace loan growth there with other loan
growth around the company. And that's why we're giving you the $600 million to $800 million range for Q4 loan
growth. And also the same for deposits, they lose some of their deposits in Q4 as taxes are paid.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Brad, I would also say that we have a senior loan committee that meets weekly that approves the largest credits
in the company. And the activity level of loans coming in from the line to that committee, which is loans above $15

million, has really stepped up significantly over the past couple of months compared to where we were, say, in the
second quarter. And so, we think we're seeing broader strength in other classes of loan credit. And at the same
time, on the deposit side, despite what we think may happen in terms of the warehouse lending piece, we're
seeing some increase in some of these other channels as well that I think are going to bear fruition in the fairly
near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, just to add to Dale, I mean, we're seeing strength in capital call business. We're seeing strength in the CRE
business, certainly around the industrial side where we're building – we're doing a lot of deals for distribution
centers. And then, Tech & Innovation is seeing a lot of new opportunities as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And maybe just to follow up on the loan growth. Where are kind of new loan yields coming on the books? I know
you mentioned a spot rate of 4.50%, but kind of curious where new production is coming on. And then, can you
talk a little bit more about the impact of the acquisition that you made, how much you paid, kind of what's the
incremental benefit you kind of see over the next 6 to 12 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Sure. So, in terms of the – yeah, that spot rate is really a spot on in terms of kind of where the numbers are. So
the actual loans that have come on have been about 5 basis points higher yielding than what the average was,
and I think that's kind of reflected there. Again, we have a lot of discipline in our team in terms of putting in a floor.
So let's suppose somebody makes a loan at L plus 3% or L plus 3.5%. What we'll define in the loan docs that L
can't go below 1% in that situation, that's a really common structure for us. So, the floor is active on the first day,
and that's how we're able to sustain new originations really right on top of the current yield.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, I'll take the second half, Galton. First, we didn't pay much money for it at all, all right? And it's a mortgage
business that specializes on buying non-QM loans from warehouse lenders. And so non-QM mortgages have a
slightly different feature than standard agency paper. They sometimes offer interest-only features or they have
more self-employed borrowers. But they underwrite very low LTVs in the 67% to 68% range and the paper carries
higher yields than the standard agency paper.
So, standard agency paper could be like 2.25% and these yields will be 3.25% to 3.5%. The acquisition came with
12 people, 4 salespeople and 8 operations people. And it provides us with a dedicated sales force and servicing
operations. So, this will allow us to ramp up our residential purchase volume while improving customer service
with knowledgeable experts. It provides cross-selling opportunities to the Galton customer base. Galton has 100
warehouse lenders that they work with, 30% of which is an overlap with us, but the other 70% will allow us to offer
warehouse lending lines and then to remove mortgages off of the warehouse lending line onto our balance sheet
if they fit our credit box. We've seen Galton in operation for a couple years. We've probably seen over 1,000
mortgages that they've underwritten. So, we have a real sense that their approach to credit mirrors ours. And we
think the big impact here will be seen middle of next year as this thing continues to ramp up and we bring them
into the fold here.

Great. Thanks for the question. Dale, I just want to make sure I got the fourth quarter guide [indiscernible]
(00:38:45) pretty quickly. The 3.90%, I believe, Ken, you said 3.90% margin, is that a fully loaded margin with the
impact of the fees from the PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Correct, yeah. The $6.9 million level that we show on that one page, so rebounding from the second quarter but
much lower than what we had – rebounding from the third quarter but lower than we had in the second.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
Getting to your question, Chris. Yeah, no, we see that we have kind of stability here. We have an opportunity to
continue to sustain earning asset growth. So, we believe we can – even if there were margin pressure in 2021
that we've got the growth trajectory that we can sustain increases in net interest income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Understood. And if we look – maybe one more on just the mix of the earning asset. If we look at the mix
between cash and securities, it's, call it, roughly 20% of earning asset, is that the same – is that a proportional mix
you'd expect of the balance sheet going forward, maybe toggling between cash and securities, 20%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I think, we can take our cash down to something in kind of the low- to mid-hundreds of millions. We think
that's really kind of the floor for us. And so, we're up at $1.9 billion that gives us a fair amount of room. In the
Federal Reserve, I mean, it's not a criticism but they pay 10 basis points. So, we think that the – we know liquidity
is abundant these days at banking companies, but we think that actually garnering more relationships and even if
they're flat or even slightly negative in terms of price, and obviously they crushed the margin because you get a
big balance at a zero spread or something like that. But we think that's going to bode well in the future as we
come out of this situation. And as Ken mentioned, we've got some funding among other channels where we've
got opportunities to really grow safely on the credit side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the investment portfolio, Dale, is that just kind of [indiscernible] (00:41:31) for that based on the
deposit – I mean, how are you thinking about the size of the bond book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I think the bond book could actually – I don't know if it's got a lot of room. I think we're comfortable with our
loan to deposit ratio in the 90s, so that's going to drive some of the investment securities portfolio. But we've got a
couple billion dollars, $2.5 billion of mortgage-backed securities in there that are yielding $100 million, $150
million less than if we buy, we think, similar risk credit with low LTV first mortgages. So, there's a possibility that
after we sap up our current liquidity through residential and other channels, that maybe we don't need to grow the
MSR book anymore and that could become a smaller proportion of the balance sheet in aggregate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then last one, if I could, just everyone's topic on taxes. Anything meaningfully different in your tax
structure and strategy today if we got a tax increase, the same math opposite direction wouldn't work next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I think you could – the proportion holds pretty well. So even though our tax rate may be
lower than some others, basically looking if you're going to $28 million and you're at $21 million, that's a 33%
increase in the tax rate. If you take our tax expense, say, for the third quarter which was $30 million and, say,
13

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
gosh, if that were to go into effect, our tax recognition expense would be up – for this similar quarter would be

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Was kind of curious, it sounds like there's an effort to grow the balance sheet
maybe with some more residential or warehouse. But I was kind of curious just about the trade-off between
growing a balance sheet in some of those more non-relationship-oriented areas versus maybe just looking at a
share buyback program and larger proportion. So, just kind of growing balance sheet versus returning capital and
how you guys are thinking about the trade-off between the two.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I would argue that we do have relationships. And what we're doing is with each warehouse lending
customer, we have a warehouse lending relationship, we could have an MSR relationship, we can have note
financing relationships. They provide deposits to us. And they also provide us with a go-forward flow on
residential mortgages.
So, don't think about the relationship as the end customer in their home, think of it as the mortgage servicer which
controls a lot of business. And we see an opportunity now, there's dislocation in the market with a number of
mergers, and also I'd just say poor performance that we're coming in with higher − high-touch customer service
that we're getting business that's coming to us and we're not having to struggle to bring that business in. So, that
to us is very important and that's what's driving the balance sheet growth. We're not trying to buy mortgages for
mortgages' sake, it's really the warehouse lenders and those relationships that we have with them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
In terms of the repurchases, I mean, where we are with this is we can sustain a balance sheet growth. And while
we don't have an [indiscernible] (00:45:12) of being opportunistic in terms of share price, we think the long-term
value creation is from expanding the franchise.

There's been no liquidation, no foreclosures. The hotel book is, given its circumstances, performing okay. 45% of
the book has a debt service coverage ratio above 1%, 45% is below it. And then we've got a few construction
loans. So we don't have a debt service coverage ratio on that. You can see hotel occupancy coming back to 50%.
That's about where our hotels are tracking to the national averages. Again, when we underwrote these hotels, we
underwrote good liquid sponsors that have the ability to call on capital from their LPs. And they did that to enter
into many of the 3 plus 3 or 6 plus 6 deferral relationships.
Tim, do you want to say anything else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I think it's important to remember we started this dialogue particularly with hotel in February. We brought
together the segment. We put dynamic leadership, some of our senior-most executives in place. And we've
maintained that dialogue around liquidity, operating performance and forward-looking capital plans. That has
allowed us to be way out ahead of problems that arise here. So, we've got strong sponsorship, we've got an
active dialogue, and we're seeing good progress towards stabilization.

Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the mortgage acquisition that you talked about earlier. Day one,
are there any other – is the revenue coming off that purely the mortgages that you put on balance sheet or is
there any other associated revenue or fees, anything that would be related to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
No. No, it comes off of the revenue – comes off of the mortgages put on balance sheet. And we've been just
integrating the team over the last three weeks or so. So, we're not looking for any mortgages to begin to hit the
balance sheet maybe for another two or three weeks.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Right. I think it's got a lot of runway in front of it. I don't have a number for you for where it might stop. But as you
know, a typical bank, that number is going to be about triple that concentration level, which is even with the
growth rates that we're talking about augmented with Galton and what we've been doing before, jeez, I mean, if
we could take it to 20% on a growing balance sheet, that's going to be a substantial increase in the balances
outstanding.
So, I think we've got years for this thing to run. We think it's a strong asset class to be in. We think the rates work
now. We've been, as you know, asset sensitive. We're really now kind of asymmetric. And this balances that out
as well. So, we think it's a good place to be, it's a lower risk-weighted asset category. And we're one of the
smallest out there in terms of relative exposure.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hello. Great. Thanks for the questions. Dale, I guess, if you could talk about – you touched on this in your
prepared remarks, I guess, in terms of the deposits. How much of those do you think you can kind of hold on to
going forward? What's the volatility of the deposit mix at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I think it's good. But there's two areas that I want to keep my eye on. One of them is, I'll call it, PPP deposits.
So, we took $1.8 billion of loans that we made and we deposited into these accounts. And we track how much
money is still there. And that number is still over $1 billion. And it's like, was that going to get burned somehow at
some point in time? Maybe that's a little bit lazy because we're in this kind of no-rate environment, so we want to
keep our eye on that piece of the thing.
And then the second piece is kind of the mortgage warehouse area. Obviously, it's been a torrid pace of
refinancing that's going to increase volumes generally. And so, I think, is there space for kind of a take a breather
in that scenario? Now, my read of what's transpiring is while maybe the refi business is going to temper to some
degree, there's still a lot of people that are eligible for refi in terms of putting themselves in a lower area. But is
there some air that can come out of that? I think there is.
What do we have? Well, we've talked about our two business lines that are deposit generating. Those both did
run into a little bit of a sidetrack because of the pandemic. Each of them benefits from kind of in-person contact or
development of personal relationships with these enterprises that they service. We think that's coming out of it

now. We think those pipelines look strong also. Ken mentioned the Tech & Innovation space, and one of our
competitors is fairly bullish in terms of what that outlook is like. And we would second that assessment.
So, while we may see softness in a couple of these categories that have been really powerful in 2020, we think
we've got handoffs that we could make to kind of sustain the [ph] realigned (00:52:16) performance in 2021 to
some of these new areas.

Got it. And separately, just on the Galton acquisition and the non-QM, and that encompasses many different
flavors of mortgage origination. Is this generally paper that just doesn't quite check the agency box or is it more of
a heavier credit component to it? And I guess, separately, what's the step-up from vanilla agency origination?
What's the step-up in rate with this paper?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting with efficiency, it seems like NII has seemingly reached a bottom here in the third quarter and
should start improving in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead, should we expect a similar level of operating
leverage, whether it's 2:1 or 3:2 as we've seen in recent years, or does the current rate environment present
enough challenges where it's likely going to be lower than that for the foreseeable future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I think we can sustain where we are in terms of the operating expense level. So, yeah, we think the margin is
fairly stable, even if rates kind of stay at this level for – maybe in perpetuity for certainly an extended period of
time. And then our expenses running at around $0.40 relative to the revenue we bring in, we think that's pretty
sustainable as well.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
So, we had some volatility in the second quarter for a variety of reasons we talked about, really, and underscores
that we're looking at the third quarter of 2020 as really being a pretty good baseline. I know some of you have
commented or looked at that we had this gain from securities gains kind of recovery of about $5 million in the third
quarter, which of course we did.
But in my view, I don't back that out in terms of what a run rate is because I'm offsetting that with the reversal we
had in PPP kind of going forward. So, we think the revenue is a good base to come from. We think the expense
base is a good base from which to grow. But, again, holding in at kind of the low-40s on efficiency.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then I just want to make sure I'm thinking about deferrals correctly. So the $1.1 billion of
deferrals that are rolling off in the fourth quarter, how much of that was part of the 6 plus 6 program? And for
those loans, is it now that the liquidity that was collected as part of the initial deferral processes, is that now
kicking in for another six months or is that entire balance going to be moving into performing status essentially?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, I mean, they prepaid, I mean – so before they got six months of deferral, they prepaid another six
months. And this is what we recommended that they do because it takes them out until the second quarter of next
year, which you can – different assumptions in terms of when we get out of this. But with therapeutics, that I think
vaccines are just, frankly, pretty close around the corner, that I think by that point in time, these entities, those
hotels are going to be able to benefit from kind of relaxed social distancing.
And so, they prepaid it all. So yes, they are paying as agreed because they're dipping into basically a control
account that is making the principal and interest debt service as they come off of deferral.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And is that around 50% that 6 plus 6 of that or is it going to be a smaller amount of that $1.1 billion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, of those that are coming off in the fourth quarter, it's predominantly the 6 plus 6 because they were done – I
mean, we did some that were 3 plus 3. Those typically came off mostly in the third quarter, right? So in the fourth
quarter, we're going to – those are the 6 plus 6s that were done in the second quarter of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then one last one for me, just looking at the technology sector, another strong quarter of growth. But I
noticed that the allowance for that sector declined on a linked-quarter basis. Was that the specific reserve release
that you spoke of or was there something else going on in that portfolio that [indiscernible] (00:57:10) reduction in
allowance?

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Couple of questions for you. And the first one is a strategic question on mortgage warehouse with it
now $4 billion of loans. And you addressed a little bit about this with the deposit discussion. But I was curious
because some investors have expressed concern generally about seasonality and volatility around the mortgage
warehouse business. Can you talk about how you're viewing that business and addressing that volatility over time
as we look ahead?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, I mean, we thought this was – again, if you look at kind of the business lines with which we can select
from and which to grow, this was a great time to go into mortgage warehouse. The demand was strong. The
quality is excellent. And because of the cycle where we are, interest rates after the FOMC actions, it's a robust
growing area. So yeah, I mean, I don't think that what's going on there is sustainable long term. If rates start to
rise, I think it's going to come down significantly. Although the purchase market is pretty active still, and that
maybe has more legs to it and less cyclicality.
But in any event, I mean, I think it's just a good example of, hey, we can go here because this is safe, this has
activity, this is something where we can move to in the immediate timeframe that we did that basically earlier this
year. If that pulls back in 2021, which I think is a reasonable probability, like I mentioned, we're looking at the
things that are coming to our credit committee and they're strong, and they're diversified. And we think that that's
where we can kind of pivot to as this one may wane a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Let me just add. First, remember that while we have $3.9 billion sitting out there in loans, we have almost an
equal amount, $3.6 billion, sitting out there in deposits. So, it's a great strength of deposit growth for us. And so, I
think that's important to remember. The other thing is when we say warehouse lending, you got to remember that
includes MSR lending, that includes note financing and warehouse lending. And so, it's a combination of all those
things. So, we do have some other levers to pull when we're dealing with some of our clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. That's really helpful color. And then shifting gears, you mentioned about the potential for reserve releases
looking out over the next few quarters or towards the maybe middle or end of 2021. But nonetheless, I was
curious, do you have a target reserve to loan ratio in mind?

Dale M. Gibbons A

We don't because it's so dependent on each particular asset type. So that number has, as we've grown in these
categories that are about a third of our balance sheet now that are little to zero loss mortgage warehouse, public
finance, capital call lines, residential mortgages, resort finance, as those have become a larger proportion, that
number is going to fall. And so I think you need to look at it more on a category-by-category basis.
I mean, if you look back to kind of what a standard normal situation might be. If you take where numbers were as
of 12/31/19 before this pandemic started and then add in the overlay that was done at the beginning of this year
for the adoption the CECL which front-loads provisioning as everyone is well aware, that number was about a 1%
number for us in terms of reserve level. I think in a more kind of benign environment and less uncertainty, I think
you kind of go back to that level. With that mix, if the mix is lower, I think that number could even fall further.

So we're always looking at that. As you know, we're very low. We lead the industry in many different categories.
We do not lead the industry fee income. And so, we are working on a few things. I would say they're going to be
marginal at this point. There's nothing that's going to move the needle as we look towards 2021. So, we're a
spread business. And for us, it's important for that balance sheet growth to occur, good asset quality, of course,
that will negate some of the lower funding – lower interest rate environment. But remember, we're able to get
floors on our loans, and 78% of our loans have floors. And so, the impact to us on a NIM basis will not be as
great.

I think everything's pretty much been covered but perhaps a philosophical question for Tim or Ken. We kind of
look at this as you're making more than you were pre-pandemic. Your returns are tangible – return on tangible is
almost 20%, [ph] stock plus (01:04:07) 30%. So the gap is probably credit concern. Do you feel like we're all
overreacting to that? Or should we expect some kind of a surge in losses over the next few quarters? That doesn't
seem like you're indicating but are we missing something here?

The short answer is yes. I mean, if you piece through everything we said today, we said that the baseline of
earnings for Q3, the $136 million this quarter, is going to be the baseline going forward for the upcoming quarters
into 2021, assuming at this point the same provisioning of about $15 million. Now, we don't see large losses on
the horizon. We don't see charge-offs rising dramatically. It's hard to find them in our book of business at this
point. So even our provision may be a little high and certainly would be a little high if the consensus economic
forecast is changed to be more favorable for the vaccines and what have you, and more states opening up after
the election.
So, I think that the – a lot of investors, I'll say it that way, overreacted to what they thought our losses could be, all
right? Almost $10 billion of our book is in really, really low loss categories. And as I said, we don't see the losses
coming our way and we're feeling good about where our net interest income is going to be in Q4, and we're
feeling good that the baseline for earnings is what you see this quarter.
