Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
I'll now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President, and CEO.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning and welcome to our earnings call. Joining me this morning are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. Gary will discuss asset quality and Vince will review
the financials. Today, I'll touch on our 2019 financial highlights, review last year's accomplishments, and wrap up
with a discussion about our strategic objectives for 2020. We will then open the call up for questions.
First, I'd like to highlight some key metrics from 2019. We are very pleased with record net income of $386 million
and record operating EPS of $1.18. These profitability levels resulted in positive operating leverage and strong
internal capital generation, driving higher capital ratios, and increasing tangible book value per share by 13%. We
were pleased with this growth as our full-year dividend payout ratio totaled 41% as we return nearly $160 million
in cash dividends to our shareholders.
F.N.B. reported total revenue of $1.2 billion amidst a volatile interest rate environment in 2019. Our portfolios
continued to expand with average loan and deposit growth of 5% and 6% respectively. This loan origination and
deposit production came from across the footprint with strong contributions from our legacy market and growing
success in F.N.B.'s Mid-Atlantic and Southeast expansion market.
Our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year with operating noninterest income up 10% and many units
selling – setting all-time records for revenue. For example, capital markets increased 56%, mortgage banking
income increased 44%, and wealth management and insurance revenues grew a combined 6%.
In the capital markets businesses, we were realizing benefits from our investments in personnel and products
fueled by our geographic expansion strategies, as well as solid execution across the footprint. Looking historically
at 2019, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the progress we've made towards the key initiatives previously
outlined in the 2018 annual report letter.
We set out to deliver superior peer-leading returns on tangible common equity and drive internal capital
generation and growth in tangible book value per share. Par 2019, return on average tangible common equity of
17% was again peer-leading, and 13% growth in tangible book value continues to track above others in the
industry. This further supports our longstanding commitment to deliver value to our shareholders.
In 2019, our strong financial performance has translated to a total shareholder return of 35%, placing F.N.B. in the
top quartile relative to peers. In tandem with delivering superior returns, we set out to protect our attractive
dividend and return capital to shareholders. We've accomplished this goal as tangible common equity reached its
highest level of 7.58% in nearly two decades at the end of December.
Looking ahead, we've now surpassed our stated targets and have added flexibility to optimize capital deployment
in a post-CECL environment. These stated objectives support the overarching goal of our organization to grow
revenue by prudently increasing our loan and deposit portfolios, all while maintaining our superior credit quality
and risk management culture.
With mid-single-digit loan growth and deposit growth and further improvement in many asset quality metrics, we
had another strong year while also improving our funding mix. As a proof point, noninterest-bearing deposits grew

nearly $400 million, more than 6%, as this remains a critical focus across the company. Additionally, we have
focused on new household acquisition and deepening existing relationships.
For the year, we had strong total deposit growth of 6%. And when excluding a planned decline in broker time
deposits of $600 million, total deposits increased nearly $2 billion or more than 8%.
Next, we set out to diversify and grow our fee-based businesses namely capital markets, mortgage banking,
wealth management, and insurance. In 2019, each of the units exceeded our expectations with capital markets
and mortgage banking income both up over 40% which directly supported total noninterest income increasing
10% or $25 million to a record $300 million.
Additionally, we aspired to continually evolve towards becoming a data-driven bank and continue to optimize the
branch delivery channel. We have focused on technology and risk management infrastructure by diligently
investing and upgrading platforms in the retail bank and improving efficiency, as well as the customer experience.
Throughout 2019, we closed 25 branches and we continue to execute our established REDI program.
Earlier in the year, we announced plans to develop de novo locations in the D.C. metro area, Northern Virginia
and in Charleston, South Carolina. Our expansion plans in these strategic geographic locations further enhance
our retail strategy and corporate banking efforts in a variety of attractive markets. As evidence of successful
execution of our growth strategy, we are firmly established with top 10 deposit market share in five out of the
seven major markets with a population greater than 1 million.
Lastly, we strive to continue to improve efficiency and manage cost. This is evidenced by our efficiency ratio
improving 30 basis points to 54.5% from 2018 to 2019, despite pressure on interest rate in a challenging rate
environment and significant ongoing capital investment in technology. Our strategy is proven through various
cycles as evidenced by the solid performance and continued focus on improvement in many key asset quality
metrics that Gary will discuss further. All these accomplishments led to a very successful 2019 and we will build
upon the strong momentum in 2020.
With that, I'll ask Gary to comment on credit quality. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out 2019 with key credit
metrics remaining at favorable levels that are tracking consistent with our expectations and remain very pleased
with the current position of our portfolio as we move into 2020.
As you are aware, the new accounting standard for current expected credit losses became effective on January 1,
2020 which not only brings changes to reserve methodology under the standard, but also marks the end of the
prior methodology to account for loans acquired in a business combination. Therefore, I will be focusing a majority
of my commentary today on our all-in GAAP credit results for the total loan portfolio. I'll also provide a brief update
on the performance of our originated and acquired portfolios to provide a few highlights of how these two books
performed.
Let's now cover the total portfolio results. The level of delinquency on a GAAP basis ended December at 94 basis
points, up 3 bps over the prior quarter's historically low levels. The long-term trend continues to track in a positive
manner as the current period showed a 13-basis-point improvement over the prior year.

NPLs and OREO trended similarly, up a few bps over very good Q3 levels to stand at 55 basis points with year-
over-year results improving by 6 basis points. These long-term positive trends are the result of our continued
focus on moving criticized assets off the books to better position the portfolio, and we were very successful doing
so in Q4.
It's worth noting that beginning in Q1 2020, acquired loans will be reported as nonaccrual when they no longer
accrue interest, as is consistent with the shift from the prior purchase accounting standard to CECL. A majority of
these acquired credits are presently reported in the 90-plus past due category. Regardless of the accounting
treatment, we will continue to focus on our current strategy of attentive and proactive workout of these subscriber-
performing assets.
As it relates to loan loss performance, GAAP net charge-offs remained at solid levels totaling $5.3 million for the
quarter or 9 basis points annualized to end the full year at $28.3 million or 12 basis points. The provision at $7.5
million for the quarter and $44.6 million for the full year adequately covered charge-offs and loan growth for these
periods. Vince Calabrese will provide some additional commentary on the reserve and CECL during his prepared
remarks.
I'll now briefly touch on the originated and acquired portfolios to provide some comparative results against the
prior quarter. The level of delinquency for the originated book ended December at 71 basis points, up 5 bps linked
quarter while NPLs and OREO increased 3 bps to stand at 59 basis points. Originated net charge-off levels for
the fourth quarter were solid at 10 bps annualized, ending December at $5.3 million with full-year net charge-offs
totaling $20.7 million or 11 basis points. Our acquired portfolio also continues to perform in line with our
expectations with contractual delinquency levels continuing to trend favorably marked by a $47 million reduction
year-over-year representing a 40% decrease.
As we close out another successful year, we are pleased with the positioning of the portfolio and our solid and
consistent credit results across all books of business. The long-term consistency and stability in our portfolio are
proof points of the disciplined approach we take in our credit and lending decisioning processes, none of which
would be possible without our experienced team of bankers across the entire footprint.
As we move ahead to the new year and the changes the CECL accounting standard brings, we remain committed
to maintaining our core credit principles to help balance growth objectives with our desired asset mix and risk
profile at this later stage of the economy. Looking back, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio
throughout the whole year and are looking forward to the business opportunities ahead of us in 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and provide
guidance for 2020. As noted on slide 4 (sic) [slide 3], fourth quarter operating EPS totaled $0.30, bringing full-year
2019 operating EPS to $1.18, an increase of 4% over 2018. As Vince previously mentioned, the TCE ratio is at
7.58%, the highest level in nearly two decades. The tangible book value per share is also at its highest level over
the same period at $7.53 per share. These numbers demonstrate our focus on providing meaningful shareholder
value while maintaining favorable asset quality.
Let's start with a review of the balance sheet for the fourth quarter on slide 6. Linked-quarter average loan growth
totaled $504 million or 9% annualized, attributable to commercial growth of 10% and consumer growth of 7%.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Focusing on spot year-end balances relative to 2018, total loans have increased over $1.1 billion or 5%. Spot
commercial growth of 7% was led by a $752 million increase in C&I balances as commercial real estate also saw
good activity on the origination side that was impacted by continued pay-downs in that space. Spot consumer
growth of 2% was driven by increases in residential mortgages of 8% and direct installment loans of 3%, partially
offset by a decline in home equity line of credit balances.
Continuing on slide 6, on a linked-quarter basis, average deposits grew 12% annualized. The annualized growth
in interest-bearing deposits of 41% and noninterest-bearing deposits of 8% was partially offset by an anticipated
decline in time deposits with a nearly $500 million decline in brokered CD balances. The shift from time to
interest-bearing deposits allows more flexibility in managing costs in a changing rate environment.
Turning to the income statement on slide 7, net interest income totaled $226.4 million, a decline of 1.5% from last
quarter as the net interest margin narrowed 10 basis points to 3.07%. Recognizing the interest rate environment
impact is not unique to us, the rate cut taking place early in the quarter clearly had an impact on variable rate loan
yields and the net interest margin.
Specifically with one month LIBOR down another 25 basis points in the fourth quarter, the net interest margin
declined slightly more than expected. Compared to the third quarter, one-month LIBOR fell 23 basis points in
October alone, which pressured asset yields from the beginning of the quarter. We were able to partially mitigate
some of the decline as interest-bearing deposit costs improved 6 basis points on an average basis and 11 basis
points on a spot basis. While we saw deposit costs lagged the move-down in LIBOR in October relative to
variable rate loan yields, we are confident that our deposit rates at the end of December will help support the net
interest margin as we move through 2020.
Furthermore, we have consumer promotional deposits repricing in February, and the anticipated decline in
interest-bearing deposit costs we expect will support gradual net interest margin expansion. We expect a
relatively stable net interest margin next quarter and then expect gradual margin expansion throughout the rest of
the year.
Slides 8 and 9 provide details for noninterest income and expense. There continues to be strong performance in
mortgage banking, capital markets and trust income, and operating noninterest income as a whole. As Vince
noted earlier, we are extremely pleased with our record fee-based results in 2019, which significantly exceeded
our expectations and importantly, mitigated the interest rate movements we experienced.
Looking at the fourth quarter, noninterest income totaled $74 million, a 7% decrease from last quarter, due mainly
to the impact from service charge refunds called out on the side. On an operating basis, noninterest income was
down 2% from a record level in the third quarter as we saw strong results from capital markets and mortgage
banking income, offset by lower gains on sales of real estate and lower results on our SBIC investment.
Turning to slide 9, noninterest expense remained relatively flat over the third quarter. On a core basis, when
removing the $3.2 million item related to the renewable energy investment tax credit from last quarter, noninterest
expenses rose 2% due to higher outside professional services, strategic technology investments in software and
equipment, and normal merit increases and incentive payout accruals for the strong 2019 performance. Expense
management remains a top priority and we are very pleased that we held core expenses relatively flat compared
to 2018.
Lastly, I'd like to reaffirm our previously disclosed expected capital impact of the CECL adoption for 2020. Last
quarter, we disclosed the estimated day 1 increase to our allowance for credit losses of 25% to 35% for the

originated loan portfolio, with the related capital impacts expected to range from 11 to 15 basis points of TCE and
range from 14 to 20 basis points of CET 1 regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis.
As a reminder, the CECL transition on the acquired portfolio results in a balance sheet gross-up of loans and
allowance with no capital impact. Once the day 1 CECL allowance is established on the acquired portfolio, the
remaining credit and noncredit marks of $115 million to $135 million on these loans are accreted into interest
income prospectively over the remaining life of the portfolio. The recognition of this accretion is similar to our
current process except that the remaining marks or discounts are maintained at the loan level as opposed to loan
pools. We expect the overall allowance coverage ratio to be 125% to 135% using 12/31 numbers.
Now, I would like to provide guidance for 2020. Mid-single-digit full-year spot loan and deposit growth, I'll note our
2020 rate outlook reflects a stable yield curve outlook with no additional Fed moves in 2020 and for one-month
LIBOR rates to remain at the levels they were at the end of December. All comparison is on a year-over-year
basis compared to 2019 reported results for the base year. Net interest income, noninterest income and
noninterest expense are all expected to increase in the low-single digits. Provision expense is expected to be in
the $55 million to $65 million range which includes the impact of CECL. Effective tax rate of 18% to 19% which
includes some level of income tax credits we've experienced over the last few years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince.

Thanks, Vince. Last January we covered major tenants of the long-term strategy, and I want to provide an update.
Throughout 2019, we continue to focus our efforts on optimizing our online and physical delivery channels to
improve the customer experience, as well as investing in our infrastructure and technology.
Coming this quarter, we intend to deploy a new interactive website designed with enhanced functionality. The
launch of our new proprietary website creates a one-stop shopping, interactive digital experience. We are excited
about the new features and a streamlined account opening process for our customers. Our ongoing investments
in innovation are critical to our company's long-term objectives and ensure that our teams have the resources to
exceed customer expectations and, in turn, support future revenue growth.
Over the past few years, we have successfully attracted high-quality talent as we continue to elevate our profile,
especially in our North and South Carolina markets. We are pleased with the quality of our team on the field and
the growing contributions from these regions.
Before turning the call over to the operator, I want to thank our entire team for all their hard work and dedication
for a successful 2019. We are well-positioned for a great 2020 and we'll continue to serve our constituencies,
actively engage with the communities, invest in our dedicated employees, and deliver greater shareholder value.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Just wanted to start with the really strong growth in demand in the quarter. Could you guys talk a little bit about
what allowed you – I know you – the thinking was to reduce the planned reduction in the brokered CD levels, but
what allowed you to grow demand as you did? Was there some promotions in there? And then what are your
thoughts for 2020? Do you think you'll continue to see this sort of mix shift in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Now, we've done a number of things to drive demand deposit growth. I think we've talked about it in the past. I
know each quarter this year, we've had pretty decent increases. We engage our team with incentive
compensation directly geared towards driving that category. That's one of the primary categories in the consumer
scorecard. And it's based upon output, not activity. So, growth and balance sheet. That's one thing that we do.
We support that activity with data analytics and leads. We have a pretty robust calling effort in the municipal
space and with our corporate bankers from a treasury management perspective, so we see good solid growth in
the commercial demand deposit balances, simply because they're being used to support services.
We talk a lot about the other fee income categories, but we've had significant growth in treasury management fee
income across the company, and particularly in the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic and the newer markets we've
entered. So, that's all helped, and it continues to help, and we've continued to see good solid growth. And that
was one of the pillars that we focused on to help mitigate margin compression this year.

We mentioned it, called it out in the annual report letter, and it was a focus of the company. So, everybody did a
great job of executing there. But there were a number of areas that we focused on to drive that, Frank. It wasn't
one silver bullet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then – but do you think for 2020, you'll continue to see that sort of trend?

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We do.

Stronger growth in demand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We do. We're going to continue to focus on shifting that mix, bringing the deposit costs down to help offset the
margin impact. Vince – as Vince mentioned in the guidance, we expect – because of a stable and steeper yield
curve, we expect margin to improve slightly over the course of the year. Our goal is to hopefully do better than
that by focusing on that mix within our funding base. And our people are very skilled at going after those deposits,
and we use a variety of tools to help them gain that market share. So, that should be a focus and should continue
to help us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then, kind of just on operating leverage, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. And
you guys obviously gave guidance and a bunch of line items, so we can plug that into our models. But just
wondering, as you think about – in 2019, you saw a positive operating leverage year-over-year. It seems to me,
just given where you ended the year where the margin was in 4Q versus the beginning of the year, that's going to
be a pretty tough ask for 2020 to put up year-over-year positive operating leverage in 2020. So, is the thinking
more so that you'll – you're just – the goal is to move the efficiency ratio for 2020 down from 4Q levels or do you
think you can get a positive operating leverage again year-over-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I would – the guidance definitely has positive operating leverage in it, Frank, for 2020. I mean, I would say, as
you would expect, it was more challenging to get there for 2020 than 2019 just given the rate environment that
we've all experienced. But within our plan, we don't go to the board without having positive operating leverage.
So, revenues growing faster than expenses. Maybe not by a lot, but it's growing faster than expenses.
And we can manage the expense side of that as we do. We had initiatives in 2019 to take out a significant chunk
of expenses, and we just have that as part of running a company. And we have similar efforts going on in 2020 to
ensure that we do have positive operating leverage. And then if we get any surprises in yield curve as far as

additional steepness, that obviously helps the cause beyond what we have baked into the plan, but within our
guidance is positive operating leverage.

Good. Thanks. Just – if we could start with the margin, here, you're saying that first quarter should be stable with
gradual increase thereafter and expecting year-end or one-month LIBOR to mimic year-end, but we're already
down 13 basis points from year-end on one-month. I guess how does that impact the thoughts for first quarter
asset yields? And then as we look out over the rest of the year, I obviously hear what you're saying on the funding
side, but do you expect to see any benefit on asset yields from continued remix or is it really – is the gradual
increase in margin really going to be funding-driven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Now, I would say a few things. LIBOR, if you look at the yield curve that's baked into our plan, has one-month
LIBOR at 1.75% at the end of the year, in the June 30. As you mentioned, the rate's lower than that today, so we
do expect the first quarter to have some slight pressure, not the magnitude of what we saw in the fourth quarter,
and then kind of builds gradually from there. If you look at the 10-year rate that's in our plan, it's 2% by the end of
the year. And, again, this is largely using the Bloomberg economist surveys.
And you got a two-year around 1.69% at the end of the year. So, I think that kind of gives you some indication of
what's in there. And if LIBOR moves back – as you know, one-month LIBOR is very volatile. It's been up quite a
bit from here and then it's come back down. So, in the short term, there's still some pressure there.
But as I mentioned in my in my comments, there's still opportunity on the interest-bearing deposit cost side. I
mentioned the 6 basis points on average, we came down. On a spot basis, it's down 11 basis points. And when I
look ahead to the first quarter, we should have the average costs down another 5 to 10 basis points in the first
quarter. So, that obviously would help to support kind of the margin being relatively stable in the first quarter.
I think that the – all the components feed into it as you mentioned, the commercial growth being the strongest
component of our growth, those are loans that are tied to one-month LIBOR largely, and you get the benefit of the
rates as they move up there. So, I mean, all the moving parts are kind of what's baked in there given the guidance
that we have on the loan and deposit growth. So – but clearly, with one-month LIBOR where it is, it puts a little bit
of pressure in that first quarter.

And then on – what's the expectation for purchase accounting accretion in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, except – the range that we gave in October for CECL, so $115 million to $135 million that will be accreted in
kind of on a loan-by-loan basis going forward. So, it's that over some average life period, whether it's three or four
years, but it's really a loan-by-loan. So, as prepayments come in, you'll get benefits of that faster accretion. If
prepayments are slower, you'll get slower accretion. But that's kind of a pool. Once we're in CECL mode, that's
going to get accreted in over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And what about just the – just from the pure interest rate marks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

Jared Shaw Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

So, the total marks and remaining discounts are within that $115 million to $135 million pool.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. Shifting over to the fee income side, obviously great quarter for mortgage banking. What are your
expectations for that, I guess, in your 2020 outlook? I mean, I'm guessing that that's going to pull back and we're
going to see offset growth in the other lines continuing through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say a couple of things on the noninterest income guidance. I mean, the overall low-single digits is
based on lower gains on sale of real estate. We had some gains this year. We were able to move some
properties off the balance sheet at a gain. And then lower capital markets revenue coming off a record year in
2019 that benefited from the rate volatility helping the cause. So that kind of – two key components to that low-
single digits.
And then the other components are kind of growing – service charges in the low-single digits. The other
categories are kind of mid to high. Some of our nonbanking businesses are in that, right around double-digits
growth. Mortgage banking is kind of mid-single digits growth expected in 2020 versus 2019. So not as strong as
2019 versus 2018, but still pretty good level in those mid-single digits.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just finally for me, down in the Carolinas, are you starting to see any early opportunities
from some of the larger deals that have taken place, the SunTrust, BB&T, as well as sort of the First Horizon-
IBKC deal opportunities for additional hiring or customer acquisition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, on the customer side, we've certainly seen a change in attitude by the customer. I mean, we're getting
opportunities to have meetings and discuss opportunities. I think in the past, some of these prime borrowers
would not open themselves up to that, but I think the uncertainty has created opportunities to at least interface,
which is positive.
I don't think – with those two mergers, we're at a point yet where the customers are feeling pain because they
haven't really finalized assignments. They haven't integrated systems. They're still going through all that. So we're
still in a period of uncertainty. But, of course, I think any disruption that exists in the marketplace, given that we're
fully staffed and we have our stake in the market and we're well-established, I think we're going to see
opportunities, particularly with the quality of the people we've been able to bring over.
On the employee side, we've always had opportunities to hire people from larger institutions. We've mentioned
that repeatedly. We've done a pretty good job of changing out some of the bankers and really upgrading in certain
circumstances with people who have long tenures in the market, who come from larger organizations. That's
going to continue to be the case irrespective of whether there's disruption. But certainly that helps us as well and
we'll see opportunities to meet and speak with people. We're nearly fully staffed. There's only a handful of
positions open in the Southeast. But if the opportunity came up to hire a high-performing banker, we would
certainly move on that opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Jared, as Vince mentioned, those opportunities with that particular merger, we'll continue as the combination gets
integrated. We have seen over the last, let's say, 9 to 12 months new business opportunities that we've already
put on the books from that transition as well. So we have generated some new customers that are already on the
books based on their concerns about the size of that and who was going to handle their credit relationship. So we
have seen positive benefit. We do expect to see more.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hi, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
I wanted to start on the capital front. The TCE/TA ratio finally got about 7.5%. I think you guys have been
articulating the potential for some capital returns, potentially share buyback after we kind of get through with
CECL. Is that still the outlook? And what capital levels are you targeting in this sort of environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say – as you guys know, we've been working really hard over many years to reach a point where
the dividend payout ratio is an acceptable level, and we have enjoyed that nice build, TCE ratio and tangible book
value as we've gone through the year.
Regarding the share repurchase activity, as you mentioned, we'll see the full impact of CECL by the end of the
first quarter. So right now, purchases will kind of continue to be in that opportunistic mode, doing things like
repurchasing shares for – the shares that you need for incentive plan purposes and those types of things in the
short term in an opportunistic – depending on stock price valuations.
As we've said before, we're not going to just build capital for the sake of building it. And with a solid earnings
outlook, we think there will be good opportunity to repurchase shares more programmatically to optimize the
capital position as we get further in the year and get kind of past CECL on the books. We think the stock is well
below intrinsic value and we'll closely monitor the economics and earn-back as we move through the year. So
depending on where all that looks, I would expect to see us become a little more active once we're kind of through
that CECL period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And is there a specific capital ratio that you kind of watch as you're thinking about capital deployment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. I mean, the TCE ratio is a key ratio for us in getting north of 7.5% – the 7% to 7.5% that we've talked about as
an operating range, and being north of that is good. But there's not a set target. We're not going to manage it right
to 7.5% on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we're comfortable at that level. And then that gives us the ability to
repurchase shares when the opportunity makes sense to do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And I just wanted to clarify from the prior questions, you had mentioned the plan you delivered included
positive operating leverage. And even if kind of the macro environment or loan growth or something were to slow,
you all are committed to generating that on a year-over-year basis.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. It's – $8 billion or 34.3% of total loans is tied to one-month LIBOR and then there's another $2.8 billion or
12.2% that's tied to prime. So, those are kind of the two pools that move any time the Fed moves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q

Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And when do these loans typically reset? Is it every 30 days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brody Preston Q

Okay. Just wanted to flip over to the average balance sheet. So, you had some pretty strong average loan growth.
I think it was plus-8% on a linked-quarter annualized basis. But relative to the period-end, that was only 4%. It
looks like maybe there were some pay-downs towards the end of the quarter, maybe consumer and indirect. Is
that fair to say?

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Nothing unusual, Brody. I mean, you have some short-term tax instruments that come due at the end of the
year, and they do pay down right during the last week of the year. So, you have some impact there. We did have
one or two CRE transactions move into the secondary market. So, there was some slight impact there right at the
end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. All right. But overall, you feel pretty comfortable with that mid-single-digit balance sheet growth sort of
target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Just wanted to step back to the deposit strength. I understand that the noninterest-bearing is sort of driven
by a lot of different – I guess a lot of different items. But just from a geographic perspective, wondering if you
could touch on sort of what drove the strength this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, our legacy markets continue to perform very well. We've had a number of wins across the footprint. So,
there were some significant wins in the Southeast, in the Mid-Atlantic which really helped, from a commercial
perspective, large Treasury management customers.
And overall, I mean, truthfully, it's just a very well-managed process from top to bottom. And we've mentioned the
investment in technology that we've made. Our mobile app is rated very highly by S&P Global. We've invested all
along in the infrastructure to use digital analytics and to help equip our sales teams with information. We have
digital scorecards that we monitor daily that are offered to the retail folks, the branch personnel, and – commercial
bankers have scorecards as well.
So, we've spent a lot of time and energy making sure that we're managing that process very effectively, and we
have products and services that are competitive and stack up well against some of the largest competitors in the
country. That's really why we've been able to drive that demand deposit growth. And I know – F.N.B. doesn't
sound like a technologically advanced bank given the name, but we've spent quite a bit of – expended quite a bit
of our resources both from a personnel and capital expenditure standpoint into providing our people with good
products and services and the ability to compete. And then measuring that performance has always been a key
driver of our success here. So...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, the markets we've entered are much more dynamic than the markets we're in. I mean, they grow, there's
population growth, there's business formation. We mentioned the thesis when we announced the acquisition. We
did an extensive study of the markets that we moved into from an M&A perspective and we felt that we could
compete effectively. And I think we've proven that over the last few years and we hope to continue to reap the
benefits of our geographic expansion. I think it creates a very positive operating environment for us as we move
through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Great. Just a couple more from me. Just wanted to touch on what drove the service charge refund this
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we would have gone back and evaluated certain transactions related to pre-2019 customer activity and
determined that we would refund certain service charges to customers. It's just part of our overall product
offerings. We're continually challenging ourselves internally. We analyze customer activity and customer
responses just to make sure we're taking kind of appropriate steps related to service charges. So, it's really a
onetime item. It doesn't affect the run rate going forward.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. And then the South Carolina markets, with Len's hiring at the Investor Day, you guys had some pretty
strong commentary around some of the initial success following his hire and just wanted to sort of touch on what

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The pipeline is very strong there. We've had some really solid hires, Len and Elizabeth, and the team down there
have done a great job of attracting talent. So, we are very optimistic about Charleston moving into next year,
particularly because we're going to have a number of locations open and available to our clients by the middle of
the year. It should be very positive for us. And the commercial pipeline is above $100 million and has been. So,
we feel very good about them.

All right. Then one more, if I can. Just wanted to get a sense, just sort of reiterate your thoughts around any
potential M&A from here as we look forward to 2020 and 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think as we look forward, we're not – again, we're still focused on operating that company that we've
established, I think we're in a great market. We're going to exploit our position in those markets. There's a lot of
disruption all around us. I think we have significant opportunities to grow organically. I think we've done a good job
over the last few years of generating positive operating leverage and being very disciplined from an expense
perspective, but still rooting out opportunities for growth and de novo expansion and investments in technology.
And we're going to continue to do that. And we've made some great investments. I think the website is going to be
rolled out and it will be very well-received. We shared a demo with a small group of you.
I think that there's a lot of exciting things coming. Obviously, the interest rate environment is not what we favor or
predicted. It's the opposite of what we predicted, but we've always been able to manage through those times and
come out the other end with good credit quality and expansion and fee income and a shift in deposit mix which
has helped us, just like this year. And we never would have expected to get where we are this year without the
margin help. But we got together as a team and we cut expenses, we focused on fee income, we managed the
teams a little tighter in the field to ensure that they produce the demand deposit growth. And we came out the
other end with a positive outcome. I expect that in 2020 as well.

Okay. So, I think from a growth perspective, there are a number of areas that we've focused on where we've had
great success, particularly in the D.C. area where we're focusing on C&I in Maryland and D.C., and we've had
good solid performance there. Moving the teams up markets are not necessarily a vertical, but focusing on larger
opportunities where we can garner additional business. As you know, we've done extraordinarily well in that
space this year with a significant increase in syndication fee, derivative opportunities, and Treasury management
fee income. I expect that to continue into next year. We've only scratched the surface.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
If you look at the CRE space, we have a number of large projects that we're evaluating. We're very careful about
what we go after, because we still feel that credit quality is king and we need to stay focused on our credit
appetite, not deviate – not be tempted to deviate. But I think those are two areas of focus.
Manufacturing's a little slower. It's a smaller portion of our portfolio than it has been historically. But I'm expecting
that – I personally am expecting that to come back around in the latter half of this year, principally because of the
trade agreements that are being signed and some other positive indicators. But I think that there certainly has
been a slight contraction there. But those are the factors that will drive growth.
I also believe that we're doing a better job in the new markets. We've trained those people. We spent a lot of
money bringing everybody through credit training and bringing everybody through our foundations training. And
those bankers in particular are much more skilled and able to source small business opportunities. We expect
SBA to do better this year. They have a significant pipeline. So, really, that will be more of a fee income event, but
still on the credit side. We also expect small business in general across the footprint to perform better. We've
made some changes there. So, there are a number of areas where we can produce growth.
And if you remember, we're one of the few banks, regional banks our size, that has the geographic dispersion and
the concentration in those attractive markets. So, for us to be in Charlotte, Raleigh, the Piedmont Triad, Baltimore,
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Washington D.C., that gives us the ability to go after a large number of prospects and
achieve our growth objectives without changing our risk appetite. So, there's plenty of opportunities for us to go
after and there's a lot of disruption across that entire area. That's the strategy on the growth side from a loan
perspective.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
No, that's great color, Vince. I appreciate it. And my last question as a follow-up guys would be I guess just sort of
big picture, does the growth outlook contemplate a reduction in kind of elevated pay-downs that were a headwind
for 2019 or for that environment to stay relatively the same? Would just be curious as to what's baked in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes. 2019, it wasn't really pay-offs in 2019. It was predetermined sales. We sold a large mortgage portfolio. I think
it was $400 million, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Three change...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So there were some things that we did that were intentional and made good financial sense going into a CECL
environment. So we're staying disciplined and focused on making good decisions. I think if you look back at the
prior year, we sold a number of distressed assets that we had acquired. We moved out over $300 million and we
sold Regency Finance. So we've created an environment. You saw the charge-offs this quarter. Our credit quality
was pristine. So I think we're – given how we're positioned going into this cycle, we should continue to benefit
from good solid credit quality as well.

But that's – those were the headwinds where they were self-imposed. And I truly believe having been in this
business for 30 years that we can't just reach for growth. We have to be disciplined. That's the trap that
everybody falls in, and that's why we expanded so aggressively geographically, so that we would have the
opportunity to achieve our investment thesis without changing the risk profile. Anyway [indiscernible] (00:52:08).

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Russell. Just one additional comment. As it relates to CRE, we do expect the secondary market activity to
continue throughout the year. It has slowed from its tepid – very strong pace back in 2018 and early 2019, but that
activity continues and we expect it will continue through 2020 as well.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Collyn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just one quick last question. Just on the loan growth, I know, Vince, you had mentioned kind of the outlook for
mortgage banking in your fee commentary, but just curious how you're kind of thinking about the balance for resi
mortgage growth in your outlook for 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's in that mid-single digits kind of – probably mid to high-single digits, I would say. It's what's kind of baked into
the overall mid-single digits. And we may do another sale in the second half of the year, similar to what we did this
year. For CECL, if you have jumbo mortgage loans where there's only a single product in the household, and over
a certain period of time, if we could not able to expand that relationship, we would consider doing something like
that again later this year. So that's kind of baked into the overall kind of mid-single digit guidance too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just now that you're kind of in these more robust markets, what's the split that you're seeing
between refi and purchase overall in your resi mortgage business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, it vary quite a bit this year as you would expect, given the interest rate movements. In the fourth quarter,
54% was purchase. It was 68% the quarter before. So you had some kind of additional refi activity coming
through, just given where rates were. So I mean normally, we're more in that 70% to 80% kind of purchase activity
in kind of a normal state.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, just two things for me. Most have been covered. But just on -baked in the loan growth, Vince, just the – I
know it's mid-single digits. I guess when you look at the C&I, which is a component of the margin and the benefit,
can – does C&I growth this year, in your expectations, grow a little bit more than that mid-single digit to kind of
help on the margin? Is that kind of how you're thinking about it or is it fair to think that's just more single-digit just
in line with the actual guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say it's in line with the guide.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Right. Okay. In the pipeline today, Vince, you said – I guess maybe you said it and I missed it, but just kind of
where it's at today, the commercial pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I didn't give total pipeline information. I mentioned Charleston was still at or above $100 million in
commercial pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That was still very solid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
I guess are you able to give any commentary on just either the commercial pipeline...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, the only thing I will – well, the only thing I will tell you is that in production, we talked about production, but
there's an unfunded component to our production calculation because we give people credit for commitments a
certain percentage of credit. But when you look at the production coming out of the Southeast, for example, I think
it's up, what, 40% year-over-year, Vince? Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. That sounds right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So we've had some good solid growth in terms of the number of transactions that we booked. Now, there is things
paying off and the portfolio is moving, but we had some very, very solid activity in the Southeast this past year.
We expect that to continue. And the pipelines overall are pretty comparable to where they've been historically at
this time. So we – that gives us the confidence to forecast mid-single digit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And just the other – only other thing for me was just on the expense guide. I guess have you
guys – can you comment on the – just Operation REDI or just kind of what you guys have in there for branch

reduction this year? I guess, is there something baked in this year on the branch reduction side or how should we
think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say a couple of things. I mean, our guidance of low-single digits for 2020 reflects the kind of
investments in several strategic initiatives that we've been talking about. The Clicks-to-Bricks scenario, the
website that Vince commented. So we have continued investment. As you know, that's part of running the
company. We're always investing every year, new branch teller platform, de novo expansion. So those initiatives
are all kind of baked into it on the kind of – the increased expense side. And then we have continued discipline
expense management to help fund those investments and deliver the positive operating leverage. And, again,
that's something that we can control.
The cost management initiative side includes that the REDI – we continue looking at optimizing the retail network,
including continuation of the normal kind of REDI activities that we have each year, continued vendor
renegotiations, facility optimization, how we're managing cash in the vaults, and on and on. I mean, there's a long
list of kind of initiatives that we have in the company that we're working on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

Vincent J. Calabrese A

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Operator: Thank you. And next is another question from Michael Young with SunTrust.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Vince C., just wanted to ask if – we've kind of had a period of rising rates where
people were locking in duration and extending duration on the funding side, and then we've kind of gone the other
way obviously over the last year. During this period of kind of more stable rates, are you looking to make any
shifts structurally within the balance sheet to maybe take advantage of in this kind of period of hopeful stability, I
guess?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I mean, we're always looking, Michael. I mean, we did opportunistically put some fundings on last year at
some very good rates when it made sense to do that and locked in some fundings. So, I mean, our Treasury
function and our ALCO function, we're constantly looking at opportunities. I mean, we don't have any plans for
any major shifts. We'll continue to look at the asset side of the balance sheet in a CECL environment where
there's opportunities to maybe create some more shelf space for the commercial loan growth. We'll continue to
look at that too.
So, I mean, it's just part of kind of how we manage the balance sheet ongoing. So, if there's more good
opportunities to do something on either side of the balance sheet, we'll do it.
