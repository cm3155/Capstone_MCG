Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, AB. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the first quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas will provide additional comments before we open it up
to your questions. In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $134 million or $2.06 per share compared with earnings
of $176 million or $2.70 a share reported in the same quarter of last year. In the first quarter, results were affected
by an additional FDIC insurance surcharge accrual of $7.7 million or $0.09 a share associated with the bank
failures that happened in early 2023.
Our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were 1.09% and 15.22%
respectively, and that compared with 1.39% and 22.59% for the same period last year. The solid earnings from
the first quarter demonstrate the success of our organic growth strategy and the hard work of our bankers. Our
strength and stability combined with our core values and strong corporate culture allow us to continue providing
world-class service to our customers, which results in sustained long-term growth.
Our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remained consistently strong. Also, as was the case in previous
quarters, Cullen/Frost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances, participate in any special liquidity
facility or government borrowing, access any broker deposits or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangements to
build uninsured deposit percentages. And additionally, our available for sale securities represented more than
80% of our portfolio at year end, at quarter end.
Average deposits in the first quarter were $40.7 billion, down 4.8% from the $42.8 billion in the first quarter of last
year. Average loans grew 10.4% to $19.1 billion in the first quarter compared with $17.3 billion in the quarter a
year ago.
We continue to see excellent results in our organic growth program. For example, we combined our Houston
locations with expansion we stand at 104% deposit goal, 164% of loan goal and 122% of our new household goal.
For the Dallas market expansion we stand at 174% of deposit goal, 212% of loan goal and 185% of our new
household goal. Just after the first quarter close, we opened the second new location on our 17 site, Austin
expansion project. Our new, our next new Austin region location will open just after Memorial Day.
At the end of the first quarter, our overall expansion efforts had generated $2 billion in deposits, $1.5 billion in
loans, and added over 46,000 new households. And it helps me to put this in perspective when I remember that
the largest acquisition in our history was a company with $1.4 billion in deposits. Our consumer banking business
continues to build momentum from the 2023's record net new household growth and we added 6,600 net new
checking accounts or households to the quarter and we had an annual growth rate there of 6.5%, which we
believe continues to put us among the top growing banks in the country.
Average consumer loans saw steady growth in the first quarter increasing an annualized 13% on a linked quarter
basis and hit a milestone of $3 billion in average balances outstanding, and we remain excited about the
prospects for our new mortgage product, which is approaching 200 loans with about half coming in the first
quarter. Looking at our commercial business. On a linked quarter basis, average loan balances increased an
annualized 10.5% for C&I and 13.4% increase for CRE. Our new commitments booked in the first quarter were
24% less than the level booked in the first quarter of 2023. Our new commercial relationships were up 10% year-
over-year and at 825 represented our highest level of first quarter relationships ever. This coincided with us
achieving our highest level ever for calling activity in the first quarter.

New loan opportunities in our pipeline were up 15% year-over-year and were second only to the last year's spike
after SVB's failure. Our weighted average pipeline stood at $1.46 billion, up by 24% from the fourth quarter and by
17.5% from the first quarter last year. And regarding those 825 new relationships in the first quarter that I
mentioned, about half of those continue to come from the too-big-to-fail banks. We continue to use discretion as
we look at our new loan opportunities, and as an example, I point out that in the first quarter, our deals lost were
up by 24% year-over-year and 82% of those deals lost were due to structure.
Credit quality is good by historical standards with net charge-offs and net, and new non-accrual loans at healthy
levels. We're seeing some normalization in credit risk ratings and we, as we come off the historic lows and
problems experienced in the years immediately following the pandemic and looking at some of the details, net
charge-offs for the first quarter were $7.4 million compared to $10.9 million last quarter and $8.8 million a year
ago. Annualized net charge-offs for the first quarter represented 15 basis points for period-end loans.
Non-performing assets totaled $72 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $62 million last quarter and
$39 million a year ago. The quarter end figure represents just 37 basis points of period-end loans and 15 basis
points of total assets. Problem loans, which we define as risk-grade 10 or OAEM totaled $809 million at the end of
the first quarter, and that's up from $571 million at the end of the fourth quarter and $347 million at the same time
last year. Three quarters of the increase was due to company-specific C&I loans with the remainder being CRE
credits of various types. And this growth in first quarter was fairly evenly split between loans in the OAEM or risk-
grade 10 and classified or risk-grade 11 categories, and was mainly attributable to a few larger credits, some of
which we expect relatively quick resolutions for.
Less than 20% of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real estate. About 50% are related to
C&I credits with most of the balance in owner occupied real estate, which of course related to C&I loans.
Regarding commercial real estate lending, our overall portfolio remained stable with steady operating
performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values. Within this
portfolio, what we consider to be the major categories of investor CRE, office, multifamily, retail and industrial for
example, totaled about $4 billion or 46% of total CRE loans outstanding. Our investor CRE portfolio has held up
well with the average performance metrics stable quarter-over-quarter exhibiting an overall average loan to value
at underwriting of about 53% and average weighted debt service coverage ratio of about 1.47.
The investor office portfolio specifically had a balance of $983 million at quarter end and that portfolio exhibited an
average loan to value of 53% healthy occupancy levels and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.53, which
is slightly improved for the second consecutive quarter. Our comfort level with the office portfolio continues to be
based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors and the predominantly class A nature of
our office building projects.
In our last conference call, I mentioned that we had just introduced a new prospect marketing campaign and
brand refresh designed to emphasize our great customer experiences. We saw the proof points of that in the first
quarter when Frost achieved the highest scores nationwide and the Greenwich Excellence Award for the 8th
consecutive year, and the highest ranking for banking customer satisfaction in Texas in J.D. Power's Retail
Banking Satisfaction Study for the 15th consecutive year. These are unprecedented achievements. No other bank
can say those things and I hope no other bank ever will, but when you think about it, that level of service is what
our customers have come to expect from Frost.
It's what we deliver on a daily basis and it's what we mean when we talk in the new campaign about real life
examples of extraordinary customer service with the description exactly what you unexpected. And none of this is

possible without the dedication of our employees across Texas, their commitment to our culture and their
optimistic spirit, make all of our successes possible and I'm proud of everything that our Frost teams are
accomplishing across all our communities.
And now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Let me start off by giving some additional color on our overall expansion results. As Phil
mentioned, we continue to be very pleased with the volume we've been able to achieve. Looking at the first
quarter, growth in both average loans and deposits was approximately 9% when compared to the previous
quarter. And for the first quarter, the profitability of the Houston expansion offset the costs associated with the
additional expansion efforts in Dallas and Austin.
Now moving to our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was 3.48%, up 7
basis points from the 3.41% reported last quarter. Some positives for the quarter include higher volumes for both
loans and balances at the Fed and higher yields on loans and investment securities. These positives were
partially offset by higher cost of interest-bearing deposits compared to the fourth quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio. The total investment portfolio averaged $19.3 billion during the first quarter,
down $510 million from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, investment purchases totaled $187 million with
$112 million of that being agency NBS Securities and $75 million in municipal. The net unrealized loss on the
available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was $1.59 billion, an increase of $199 million from the $1.39
billion reported at the end of the fourth quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the
first quarter was 3.32%, up 8 basis points from the fourth quarter.
The taxable portfolio, which averaged $12.5 billion, down approximately $582 million from the prior quarter had a
yield of 2.83%, up 8 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax-exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $6.8
billion during the first quarter, up about $73 million from the fourth quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of
4.27%, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 70% of the municipal
portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter
was 5.5 years, up from 5 years at the end of the fourth quarter.
Looking at deposits. On a linked quarter basis, average total deposits of $40.7 billion were down $459 million or
1.1% from the previous quarter. We did continue to see a shift – a mix shift during the first quarter as average
non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $720 million or 4.9%, while interest-bearing deposits increased
$261 million or 1% when compared to the previous quarter.
Based on first quarter average balances, non-interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were
34.3%, compared to 35.7% in the fourth quarter. The cost of interest-bearing deposits in the first quarter was
2.34%, up 7 basis points from 2.27% in the fourth quarter. Looking at April month-to-date averages for total
deposits through yesterday, they are up about $134 million from our first quarter average of $40.7 billion with
interest-bearing up $332 million and non-interest-bearing down $198 million month-to-date.
Customer repos for the first quarter averaged $3.8 billion, basically flat with the fourth quarter. The cost of
customer repos for the quarter was 3.76%, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter. In the month of April, average
balance per customer repos was down approximately $42 million from the first quarter average.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Looking at non-interest income expense on a linked quarter basis, I'll point out a couple of items. Trust and
investment management fees were down $1.1 million or 2.7%, impacted by lower estate fees down $1.5 million.
Estate fees can be lumpy as they're based on the value and number of estates settled. Insurance commissions
and fees were up $5.6 million or 44%. Property and casualty and benefit company bonuses, which are typically
received in the first quarter, contributed $3.4 million to the increase. Benefit commissions were up $2.1 million as
the first quarter is typically the strongest quarter for those commissions.
As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the weakest quarter for insurance commissions and fees given our
typical yearly renewal cycle. The other non-interest income category was down $6.9 million, primarily related to
$4.4 million in card-related incentives as those incentives are received in the fourth quarter each year and a $3.5
million fourth quarter recovery of a previous loss accrual.
Salaries and wages were up $1.4 million as increased salaries and higher incentive accruals were mostly offset
by stock compensation expense, which was lower by $8.2 million. As a reminder, our stock awards are granted in
October of each year and some awards by their nature require immediate expense recognition.
Benefits expense was up $7.9 million, impacted by higher payroll taxes and 401(k) expenses related to annual
bonuses paid during the first quarter and impacted by the normal trend for FICA taxes and 401(k) limit's reset at
the beginning of the year. Other non-interest expense was down $6.4 million or 9.6%. The decrease was driven
primarily by donations expense, which was down $3.5 million, and professional services was down $2.9 million.
Regarding our guidance for full year 2024. Our current projections include two 25-basis-point cuts for the Fed
funds rate over the remainder of 2024 with one cut in September and another one in November. This is down
from five cuts in our January guidance. For the full year of 2024, we currently expect full year average loan growth
in the high single digits. That's up from our previous guidance of growth in the mid-to-high single digits. Full year
average deposit growth in the range of flat to 2% that's down from our previous guidance of growth in the range of
1% to 3%. Net interest income growth in the range of 2% to 4%. That has not changed from our previous
guidance with the net interest margin percentage expected to trend slightly upward each quarter for the remainder
of the year.
Non-interest income could be flat to up 1%, impacted by the pressure facing the industry on interchange revenues
and OD fees and also impacted by our high level of sundry income in 2023. That represents a slight improvement
from our previous guidance of basically flat. Non-interest expense growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a reported
basis. This has not changed from our previous guidance. Regarding net charge-offs we still expect those to go up
to a more normalized historical level of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Regarding taxes our effective tax
rate for the full year of 2023 was 16.1% and we currently expect a comparable effective rate in 2024. No change
to this guidance.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess start, starting off with the NII guide. So you guys are leaving it
intact despite, you getting less cuts. The loan growth sounds like it's coming in a little bit stronger than even your
revised high single digit guide. So I guess it's just, it's the higher funding cost pressure that's keeping it intact. Just
a little more color on the NII dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It's certainly some of that. And also, we're talking about higher for longer. As we've talked about the
competitive field out here for deposits, I think the higher that, the longer that rates stay higher, I think we'll
continue to see more pressure on deposits. We've been talking obviously for a while now about customers looking
for a higher yield and I think that pressure will just continue. We continue to see that especially in the non-interest-
bearing side where people are continuing to move their deposits. We continue to see a little bit downward trend
there and I think just the uncertainty there is going to make us just stay with our original guidance even given the
cuts, the reduction of a couple of cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And maybe just following up on that. So what does your NII guide assume in terms of DDA mix. I
believe it's, it fell to 34%, and then what about betas from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. The betas is really at this point, we're not assuming because we don't have any rate hikes in them. We're
not assuming any significant movements in the betas. I think our cumulative beta we've got, if I remember
correctly, we were at a 42 and we moved up to 43. I'd expect that we'd have that sort of potential pressure. We're
not seeing a lot of movement in the interest-bearing, the non-time accounts. We tweaked some downward
actually a little bit. So at this point, you may see that same sort of increase of 1% quarter-over-quarter but I don't
expect that to change drastically. Of course, we'll continue to keep an eye on what's going on in the market.
I don't hear nearly as much crazy CD pricing as we heard, call it four or five, six months ago, but there's still some
stuff out there going on. So from that standpoint, I expect some pressure on the beta but I don't expect it to
change significantly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And the DDA mix of 34, it sounds like there's more pressure. Just wondering how much more...

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I would think that. Yeah. I would think there will continue to be pressure there. I don't expect it to, I expect
that it would move down a little bit, but I don't expect a drastic change at this point. You kind of heard the
movement that we have in that category was down a couple of hundred million year-to-date. And as a reminder
for us, the first half of the year historically and maybe these are not historical times, but historically the first half of
the year is always softer for us on DDA. And so that's not really unusual to us. I think I mentioned in the January
call we were already seeing DDA down, call it $400 million between the time of the call compared to the fourth
quarter average.
I think what we continue to do is we just continue to be focused on growing relationships. You know, I think we
really feel very comfortable with what we're doing, the successes that are being reported out there and we'll just
continue to keep plugging along with that. There's not a lot we can do. These customers are looking for higher
averages and we're going to do what we can but I would expect, back to your question, I would expect there might
be a little bit of pressure for that to go down a little bit as well.

Hi, everyone.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Maybe to start sort of follow-up on Casey's question on NII. Jerry, last quarter, I thought you said that NII up 2% to
4%. I was assuming five rate cuts but if we didn't get any cuts, we would add like 1.5% to that increase. Is it still
the same? If we get no cuts this year, do you think it would have 1.5% above or has that potential improvement
lessened now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, it probably lessened a little bit now. Part of it again is, when we're talking, this whole conversation is
about the non-interest-bearing deposits and obviously that's a big impact on that number. So, given what the
pressure that we saw there a little bit more than we expected in the first quarter and as I responded on the
previous question, not really ready to increase our guidance. It's really more related what happens there. And I
think that will really drive a lot of it.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
The month of April, like I said, doesn't look unusually bad. And it's a little tough to really address all of this
because for us, from a cyclical standpoint, this is where we would typically be. We'd be a little bit softer and we've
kind of said that for a while now that the first half of the year will be softer. So, at this point, we're, we'll just kind of
have to see where it plays out. But, yeah, I think the big swing factor is what happens with those DDA balance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, thank you. On the loan growth side, you guys had solid loan growth and really in the
quarter where the industry has not much loan growth to speak of at all, how much of the loan growth is coming
from current customers borrowing more really a sign of the health of the markets versus just pure market share
gains like new customers to the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Steven, I don't have that number at hand. I can tell you what some of the new customers have done to
loan growth. If Jerry can help me out with that but just to talk a little bit about it the, it was interesting that a lot of
the activity we saw in pipeline increase is, was customer related. And as opposed to prospect so I think that was
interesting and I think also an area that we saw is that core loan growth, the under $10 million relationships. I
think it's, the activity there was better than the large loan deals and I think that reflects our expansion growth. And
so, it's pretty broadly based and so that's what you're seeing.
One second. I might be able to...

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
See I did find what I was looking for. In the first quarter, we added $145 million in new loan balances and $100
million in deposits from new relationships over the last 12 months.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's about a quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
About a quarter. Yeah. Part of the reason I asked, you know, even though the industry has fairly modest growth
this quarter, quite a few banks are coming out pretty bullish as seeing pipelines build and you guys already up low
double digit in terms of year-over-year on loan growth. Jerry, I know you said high single digit but if you're seeing
the same pipeline build, it would seem that puts you in a pretty good position to maybe even do better than high
single digit. Do you just want to be conservative here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, I think I guess if you're asking, could it move up to the low double digits. I think what we're hearing in
some of it is we could obviously but just hearing some of the conversations with the regional presidents, I mean,
there is a little bit of slowness going out there. Some of this growth is coming from commitments that were
originated last year. So although everybody is still pretty bullish, there's a little bit still of concern about what
happens through the rest of the year. So, could it happen? Yeah. I mean, the numbers are trending really well
both on a linked quarter and a year-over-year. I think we were, both of them were north of 10%. So we could kind
of tweak up into, instead of a 9%, could we be at a 10% or 10.5%? Certainly. But again, we are getting, we are
hearing a little bit of word of caution from some of our guys out in the field.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steven, I'd say there are a couple of forces or there are a few forces that are on the positive side, some are on the
negative. I just talked to some of our people about how it looks. They've just done some calls yesterday, got back
from it and their opinion was that they're seeing good activity and there is kind of a bifurcation of the high end of
the market's doing really well and some of the low end is under some pressure. But, so those offset themselves a
little bit but, activity is good but we're also being careful on what we're seeing in structure. Like I said, we lost 82%
of the deals lost were in structure. I think as we see some of the banks getting back in the game, they're getting

back to where they were before I guess, and a little bit more aggressive than we'd like to be. So that will be a little
bit of a limiter on us if the market gets out of hand. But overall, I think it's got a good outlook. And one of the
reasons is because that pipeline information that I showed you, as I mentioned a few minutes ago just the growth
in the linked quarter pipeline with strong the number of new relationships are strong.
So we're doing well competitively and I think the market in Texas is still reasonably good. I think Jerry is right.
Some people are, continue to be a little bit circumspect around the election, probably might impact what some
people are willing to do until we get the lay of the land regulatorily what they're going to be looking at. But I would,
and I probably felt that a little bit more cautious last quarter but interestingly what I've heard recently has been
pretty good.

Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Back on the NII guide. I was just wondering what your assumptions are for liquidity
trends you're baking into that. It sounds like you made some securities purchases this quarter. Is the plan to grow
that book some from here to reduce some of that cash and take some of the asset sensitivity off the table? And if
you have those purchase yields on those different segments, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. On the – let me give you those purchase yields first. I got those right here. So in the agencies we
bought at a 5.49 and the municipals at a 5.18 TE. What we're doing right now is, I don't see liquidity moving very
much during the year. Loan growth has obviously been better than we expected. We have been targeting
investment purchases of about $1.6 billion is I think the guidance that I'd given, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion for the
year. We're talking about scaling that back somewhat.
Part of it is we just want to continue to be opportunistic in this environment. And so, you'll probably see us. I don't
know if that will affect the liquidity number much, but I'm thinking that we probably won't reach that number this
year. We'll probably be a few hundred million shy of that. Like I said, loan growth has been better. Deposits, like I
said, a little bit softer than we expected even in that on the non-interest-bearing side. So, all things being equal, I
think the net-net of it is you won't see a whole lot of change in the liquidity. And if there is a bias, it's probably a
small bias to increasing that somewhat.

Yeah. Okay. And then just on your comment of less NII upside in a higher for longer type of scenario. I was just
curious where that NII sensitivity is now on delaying a cut. I think last quarter you mentioned something like
roughly $1 million of benefit each month. What is that now roughly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think a lot of it depends on timing. When we look at it, again, the cuts that we've got in our models are in
the second part of the year. And so again, depending on what's happening with balances at the Fed, I'd say that
number is probably and again, assuming they happen later in the year, it's probably closer to a $1.4 million a
month benefit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And maybe switch...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...on a pre-tax basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Pre-tax, okay. Great. And then on just credit, you mentioned maybe if I heard this right, a few larger credits
impacting the problem loan trends this quarter. I was just hoping to get some detail on those. And then where are
you on your office reserve ratio at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Well, let me take the question with regard to the increased problem loans with a risk-grade 10 and higher.
As I said, it was end-use industry or company specific related. There was – and I've talked about some of these
before. There's a large construction company that had missed some bids in the one segment. They're looking for,
actively looking for a refinance now but we need to recognize at a risk-grade 10 in the interim period. There was a
factoring company that we increased to risk-grade 10 just because of some perspective on borrowing base
computation, et cetera. We decided we're not all on the same page and that was one of them.
There was a truck hauler we saw have some issues with regard to volume. There was a company that moved into
a brand-new facility, a fairly significant facility. They're getting used to that they had an operating loss in the near
term as they moved that over. So we need to recognize that until they turned that around. Those are the things
they are – they're more, like I said, company specific. They're not really so much interest rate related except for
the things that relate to used cars primarily. The buy here, pay here dealers that's true both the consumer on the
car side and also on the trucking side. That's the closest thing to an interest rate impact that we've seen since
we've had some of that, but that's not new for us. We've been talking about that for the last two quarters, but
that's the kind of thing that we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. What you will see in the 10-Q is we don't give a very detailed view there. I think the commercial real
estate reserve coverage is like at a 1.48. But what some of what we do with the overlays, just to give you a little
bit of the inside baseball there is that for – and this is for non-owner occupied and construction office – office
buildings that are in construction. So the highest or the best or the worst I guess I should say past-grade credits
that we give them a 5% reserve.
And then anything worse than that, so if you start getting into a 9, which is a watch and a 9 and worse, they
actually get a 10% reserve. So, as I look at these numbers on a combined basis, that brings me and this again,
this is on the investor office and any office buildings under construction, that combined reserve would be at a 3.72
is what I'm showing.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to, so if I could follow up on the problem loan discussion. Just if we're in
this higher for longer rate environment, because I heard your comments that these aren't interest rate related yet,
but the longer that we're in this higher for longer rate environment, do you see more pressure on like C&I loans
and continued increases in the problem loans sector?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Peter, I don't see anything that's significant or a trend for the higher for longer on the C&I piece to be honest. I
think that, again, with the exception of some of the auto dealers that I talked about who are in portfolios credit and
having some issues there, I don't really see that so much. I think the impact is going to be more on real estate,
commercial real estate and what people, what they were financing at before and where they are today.
And those things are going to have to be solved by borrowers and sponsors coming in and supporting their
projects, when they come to maturity. And so far, we've had really good experience and really good performance
by our borrowers but we could create scenarios where interest rates went higher if we need more pressure but
we're not seeing that right now.

Okay. And then just separately, the insurance commissions, it had really nice growth in 2023. It was up almost
10%. But the first quarter year-over-year, it was down 3.5%. Is there anything unusual this quarter or just how are
you looking at that on a full year basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. The one thing I'll say on the comparison to a year ago. So the first quarter of last year had a very strong life
insurance commission. So we were probably unfavorable this quarter in that comparison by about $1.1 million.
And so the commissions on those policies are just one time. You're in a one-time fee. It's not like, benefit
commissions or property and casualty that tend to be a little bit more of an annuity. So that was a little bit lumpy.
That was probably the biggest thing that affect us, affected us negatively compared to the first quarter last year,
although I'll say that the benefits commissions were softer than I expected as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A question on expenses. I know that you left your expense guidance unchanged at the 6% to 8% growth rate
year-over-year. Curious, I know you mentioned that FICA taxes and some kind of 1Q seasonality drove the higher
expenses this quarter. Should we assume that we kind of fall back from this first quarter level as we go into the
second quarter and then grow from there? Or do you still think you grow from this run rate into next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think a couple of things I'll say is that we did get the additional surcharge of $7.7 million, right, from the
FDIC that we didn't know anything about when we gave the guidance in January, and we've been really trying to
run a tight ship here in this first quarter on expenses. Again, we are certainly impacted by the expansion that
we're doing. And so we kept our guidance the same even though we were basically saw an additional almost $8
million in expenses that we hadn't expected. And your question was a little muffled, but I think I heard you say that
maybe the first quarter was higher from the benefits maybe. I think benefits tends to go down during the year. A
14


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
lot of it has to do with things like 401(k) contributions, matches that we have to make or payroll tax matches. In
certain cases, employees want, especially on the 401(k) side, they reached that limit pretty quickly, intentionally or
unintentionally.
And so then our, we match up to 6%. If they reach that level, then the match stops and same thing for the FICA
after they reach a certain level of course, there is no more contribution there. But so, it will the benefits will go
down certainly just trend wise. I don't see the trajectory that we have, other than if you take the $7 million out, I
would expect that you'll see a little bit of growth quarter-over-quarter in expenses based on what we're seeing
today. But like I said, I feel good about where we're at. I think we've done a good job this first quarter and continue
to try to do that. But I would expect that they will continue to go up just a little bit quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. That's helpful. And to be clear, that 6% to 8% includes the $7 million FDIC assessment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Exactly. Yeah. We just, we assumed it's operating if you will for those purposes. So the $51 million is in the
number in 2023 because it's on an as reported and the $7 million number is included in our 2024 numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then next question on fee service charges, it seasonally also is usually lower in the first quarter
but I know you've talked about interchange and some other things being softer in the first quarter. So would you
expect that to also ramp or increase as we go into the next couple of quarters or is this also a good kind of lower
run rate for service charges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the thing with service charges, the upside to it has been the commercial service charges. In
some cases it works against you, right? Because in some cases, customers may hold, decide pay more for
services through hard dollar charges rather than through keeping the balances. So that's some of that. And so
that's been impacting the growth but we've done a lot of things I will say in favor of the customer as it relates to,
especially on the consumer side, on OD fees and we continue to see good growth there. But a lot of it as Phil
mentioned, we're just growing those accounts pretty significantly. And, I really kind of try to say that I don't expect
those are going to grow. And obviously, there's some guidance out there potentially a lot of pressure that, on
those fees. So, we've really been, I will say, in some ways pleasantly surprised but I don't see that having a lot of
growth from where we are today. I think it will just be continue to be pressure in that category for the rest of 2024
is kind of the numbers that I'm seeing right now.

Manan Gosalia Q

Hi. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to ask about deposit pressure. And most banks spoke about how deposit pressure eased in the first
quarter. Do you think there's something related to your specific customer mix or the fact that you are accelerating
growth in new markets? What do you think is driving that incremental pressure on deposit cost for you guys
relative to what we're seeing in the broader market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
From a cost standpoint, I will say that we're really not feeling, from a market standpoint, not feeling a lot of
pressure on the deposit cost side. We need to be competitive and we are. I think we've got to, we decided we're
competing primarily on the 90-day CD. It's really more of the pressure is coming on the non-interest-bearing. And
I think it really just continues to be the scenario where rates at these higher levels continues to put pressure both
on commercial customers and consumer customers looking for balances.
I will say that when we look at the balances especially on the interest-bearing side and it's true, I think, both in
consumer and commercial is that we have seen increases in, from February to March, small increases and then
March to April as well on that interest-bearing side. So I think competitively pricing wise, I think things are going
right. I think, historically, like I said, our balances just tend to be softer in this first quarter. But, we're going to
compete on the pricing. We're not going to be the highest. We've never intended to be the highest but we do keep
an eye on what's going on there and we make decisions, obviously, on where we want to compete. But as I said
earlier, we're not seeing a lot of pressure on what I'll call the interest bearing, but non-cds, if you will. So the MMA
specifically, not seeing a lot of pressure there yet competitively. So we really haven't moved those rates for a
while now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, maybe on the loan side. You spoke about the deals lost being up because of structure. Where
are you seeing this competition coming from? Is it private credit? Is it other banks? And, is part of the reason for
maybe the weakness in NIM because you're skewing to higher quality and lower yielding loans right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The first part of your question, I'd say it's mainly banks that we're seeing structure and it's the same old story. You
know, it's guarantees, it's loan to values, it's terms all of that. So there's some of that. I don't know we're, it could
be certainly vis-a-vis private credit, where we're getting a lower yields than they're able to achieve but albeit with
higher risk in their case but you're probably going to see that we've got a little bit lower yield on average, but not
by a lot because we tend to be on the higher quality piece of the credit curve.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And if I could just have a clarification on one of your comments on the security side, I think you said
the duration on that book was up about 0.5 year to 5.5 years. Is that entirely from the move up in rates or are you
taking on a little bit more duration to lock in the benefits of higher rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. Like I said, we really didn't do a lot of purchases in the first quarter. I think some of it was that we had about
$1 billion in treasuries that were at the end of the year, let's say call it $750 million of it that were maturing the first
few days of January. So that was affecting it. And I think there might have been there might be a little bit more
extended duration on the mortgaged backs, but we haven't added a whole lot of duration with anything that we've
done in the first quarter.

Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Phil, should we expect the potential problem loans to continue to migrate higher or is that not necessarily true?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, the, first of all, I'll say problem loans, right? The old potential problem loans is a category that we don't
usually but in the risk-grade 10 and higher should we expect the increase. I would say maybe and the reason I'd
say that is because we were at such low levels. Really the industry is at unsustainably low levels coming out of
the pandemic for credit quality, right? And so we're still not where we are I would say normally. And so, but we are
seeing some, what I would call some reversion to mean.
So that would tell me, yeah, we probably ought to expect it to go up some. At the same time, some of these that
we've added, we're looking for some reasonably quick turnarounds on them. I mean, we're just trying to be
realistic with these risk grades that we're adding. And then it's not a death sentence or anything. It's just
recognizing that we perceive some elevated risk. But we do work on them and work to get to correcting the
companies work to correct.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
And so I'm hopeful that with some of these that we brought on this time, we'll see them move out. But we could
also see some more move in because, again, we're really coming off a really unsustainably low level. So that's
why I say maybe. I'm not concerned with credit quality. I mean, I know I'm paid to worry as Frost Banker and so I
guess there's that part of me that's always going to be concerned with it. But, I think credit quality is good. I mean,
we've spent a lot of time looking at our commercial real estate portfolio and very granular level.
And I'll tell you that probably if somebody said Austin office building they would run for the hills. But I would tell
you, I think our Austin office building portfolio is solid, man. I have looked at the, I've looked at the multifamily
deals. People would say, oh, man, Austin, it's got a reduction in the interest rates. The housing prices come off
11%, got a lot of supply coming on, et cetera, et cetera, but I look at our multifamily in the Austin market I feel
great about.
And so it depends on the deal, it depends on your sponsors, how they're operating. As far as the Austin house
prices being down 11%, they were up 50% of the two years before that, right? So, I mean, there's this headline
stuff. I mean, if you really look below it and you spend time on it, I mean, I feel great about the commercial real
estate portfolio for us. Our people have done a heck of a job underwriting it and part of the reason I feel great is
the same reason that we lost 82% of the deals to structure this quarter. Our folks know how to book these things.
That doesn't mean we won't have problems and I've talked to you about some that have popped up and all but it's
not something that gives me any worry.
I think it's interesting what's happening with the company specific stuff on the C&I side. We're going to see, we'll
continue to see things pop up there and some of these guys may not be able to solve their problems, but most of
them will but that's just banking. It's a risk business and I really think we have a handle on it. And anyway just felt
the need to say that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Yeah, yeah. So it doesn't sound like you guys feel the need to build reserves from here. I mean I hear your
charge-off guidance and I respect that, but it doesn't feel like you have more pressure coming at least in your
mind in terms of credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't feel that way now. I mean...

You know, can we see it get worse? Sure, it can. Jerry can speak to the formula better than I can, but I think we
feel really good about where the reserve is today. And I think another thing I might say about the reserve, as you
might recall, we built it up there during that COVID period and we never took it out. And so, I think it...

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a little bit different than others. Yeah. We pretty much stayed there and we really haven't if you
look at our reserve coverage percentage, it really hasn't moved around very much and I wouldn't expect that it
will. It's going to move a couple of basis points here and there, but I don't envision at this point any significant
reason that we would see that reserve number increasing. Again, if you're assuming a pretty normal sort of credit
quality environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Jerry, as long as you have the mic. You changed the presentation of the expansion contribution for
the quarter. What, if you can share, what kind of contribution did Houston 1.0 have this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think it was – last time we rounded to $0.07, but let me make sure I was going to say. I think we rounded
to $0.06 this quarter, but let me just check. That's exactly right. They were $0.07 last quarter. $0.06 this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Correct. Yeah. I would just netted the two and I was trying to keep it simple. Maybe I confused you but yeah,
Houston together is funding the other expansion. That was really as we had talked about this and planning it out
that was certainly the way we hoped things were going to work out that as these financial centers began to
mature, they would begin to pay for the future expansions and it certainly worked out that way.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you. One comment I'll make that Catherine had asked about expenses. And one thing I wanted to clarify
and I made a comment in my comments about the linked quarter in salaries. So, for us, a lot of the stock awards
are given in October. And so, they do affect the fourth quarter. And so typically salaries for us are higher in that
fourth quarter. And because by their nature, a lot of these stock awards immediately vest and as a result they are
immediately expensed. So I think if you looked at the growth in salaries expense between the third quarter and
fourth quarter last year, you'll get some sort of an expectation wise what you might expect to see between the
third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. Just to give a little bit of a better color there so.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. I would expect, all things being equal, we may be down a little bit, but it's going to be relatively flat.
We're expecting cash flow, I think, of about $1.2 billion and the weighted yield of those are about a 2.26 and that's
impacted somewhat. We've got $500 million that doesn't mature until the fourth quarter and those are some
treasury securities at 96 basis points. And right now, I think some of you heard kind of what we were buying. We, I
would expect that, if you're talking about something in the 5.5 versus that rounded 2.25, you've got some nice
pickup potential there.

So does that imply Jerry that NII should keep growing from the first quarter levels as we move through the year
and fourth quarter will probably see a lift again from the securities yield going higher?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. That's kind of what I would expect. Yeah. That the net interest income is on a little bit of a positive
trajectory. I think for us, the low was probably last year sometime in the I would say the second, first, second or
third quarter.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We should, we are kind of expecting small pickups for the rest of the quarters moving forward.
