Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Cal. In many regards, 2022 was a banner year for Synovus. We began last year with an Investor Day
which affirmed to the market who we are, and detailed our path forward to become a more innovative, resilient
and high-performing bank. As the year progressed, we faced an increasingly volatile operating environment.
However, our team rose to the challenge, continuing to execute the plan laid out in February.
Given our strong footprint, the ability to monetize rising rates and the performance of our business units we've
demonstrated throughout 2022, our ability to execute and deliver profitable growth, resulting in top quartile return
on average asset and efficiency ratio levels as compared to our peers.
We achieved the success while also investing in the future and pivoting where needed to address the changing
economic liquidity and credit landscape. I want to thank our team for delivering on our purpose again in 2022,
enabling people to reach their full potential. Feedback through sources like J.D. Power is showing record client
satisfaction scores and 15 awards from Greenwich Associates for Excellence in service to middle market and
small business clients prove we remain trusted partners to a growing and loyal legacy client base across our
geography.
Credit for this kind of recognition goes to this exceptional team and our ongoing investments in strong, scalable
capabilities and solutions that add value. Today's report is shaped by continued growth and stability in our core
banking franchise given our ability to deepen the wallet share of existing clients and consistently attracting new
relationships. We are also benefiting from investments in technology, process improvement and innovation, as
well as a common sense approach to expense, credit and capital management. For these reasons, we exit 2022
a stronger company with a tremendous amount of momentum as we continue to execute on our road map, which
will allow us to deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance.
Now, let's review 2022 and fourth quarter highlights on slide 3 and 4. We realized robust revenue growth in 2022
as net interest income expansion was fueled by double-digit loan growth and our overall asset sensitivity given
rising rates. A challenging mortgage environment pressured fee income, however, excluding mortgage client fee
income collectively increased high single digits on a full-year basis, signaling the depth and breadth of our core
client relationships.
Our efforts to double down on the commercial client segment is producing outsized growth as our commercial
lines of business generated $4 billion in loan growth, all at higher spreads while adhering to our conservative
credit standards.
To that point, credit metrics improved over the year and currently stand at or near historically low NPA, NPL and
NCO levels. We applied the same disciplined approach to capital management, growing capital in the quarter and
ending the year with a CET 1 ratio of 9.63%.
Our two-year Synovus Forward initiative surpassed its $175 million run rate goal in the fourth quarter and
although the initiative is complete, the emphasis on expense control and efficient revenue growth is more deeply

ingrained in our culture, and we identify and act regularly on new opportunities to generate incremental value to
our financial performance.
Despite increasing pricing pressures on the deposit side, we managed deposit cost well throughout the year,
benefiting from prudent strategy and an extended lag on deposit repricing. Overall, deposit production rose 30%
for the year and was sourced from multiple lines of business. I was especially pleased with our sales efforts in the
fourth quarter as our teams increased sales activity, resulting in an overall growth of $900 million in new
production quarter-over-quarter.
The operating environment for deposits remain competitive with the retention of client balances and growth and
new production remaining primary focuses in 2023. While delivering great financial performance during the year,
we also continued to make progress with the development and rollout of the key initiatives that will allow us to
deliver new sources of revenue in 2023 and well into the future.
CIB continues to prudently grow and execute, reaching 20 team members in the fourth quarter and booking their
first capital market fees and depository relationships. Maast also reached a key milestone as they are live with
their first client and have booked revenue during the month of January.
On the treasury and payment side, we fully completed our client migrations into the new gateway portal and went
live with our new foreign exchange platform. We continue to see traction with the investments we're making in
treasury and payment solutions as the growth in production and the associated revenue continues to outpace the
underlying markets and our peer benchmarks.
In order to continue to increase the capacity of our commercial relationship managers while improving the client
experience, we are also investing in new technology and re-engineering our processes to streamline the client
underwriting and onboarding experience.
On the consumer side, we further streamlined our branch network by closing 36 locations during the year while
investing in analytics and digital capabilities to ensure we continue to efficiently and effectively serve our targeted
client base. Simply, 2022 was a year of progress across our entire organization. I am extremely proud of our team
and their accomplishments and encouraged by our positioning as we enter 2023.
Jamie will now share greater detail on the key activities and financial results for the fourth quarter. Jamie?

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide 5. Total loan balances ended the fourth
quarter at $44 billion, reflecting quarterly growth of $1.1 billion. On an annualized basis excluding PPP, this
represents a growth rate of 11%, our sixth consecutive quarter of annualized double-digit loan growth.
Growth was again led by our commercial lines of business and was diversified across multiple industries and
segments, for both [ph] CIE (00:08:07) and CRE asset types, growth as a function of moderated production and
low levels of paydowns and payoffs, particularly for transaction-driven sectors such as CRE and corporate M&A.
Activity and pipelines remain muted as a result of the current environment. In addition, current underwriting
standards account for higher risk in certain sectors, and where we are extending credit, we have been able to
exercise greater pricing power to drive margins as reflected by increasing spreads on new floating rate
commercial production in the fourth quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Moving to slide 6, the industry wide headwind for deposit growth remained in the fourth quarter as continued
interest rate hikes, seasonal spending and other liquidity deployment drove account diminishment. Despite these
pressures, we were able to grow core deposit balances, which increased by $373 million quarter-on-quarter. This
growth was a combination of a bank wide focus on new deposit production and seasonal benefits from public
funds.
As evidence of the positive momentum we have around deposit production, when looking at the fourth quarter,
new production excluding public funds increased over 50% from Q3. Our recent efforts both to generate and
retain deposits have been encouraging, and our focus is on maintaining that positive momentum within what
remains a challenging deposit environment.
To that end, we will continue to ensure that we have balance between prudently managing deposit costs while
remaining competitive through this FOMC tightening cycle. Our average cost of deposits increased 50 basis
points in the fourth quarter to 0.88%, which equates to a total deposit beta of 21% through Q4.
As a result of pricing discipline and continued pricing lag, this beta continues to remain lower than the 35% to
40% range we have previously communicated as our base case for total deposit betas this rate cycle. With recent
deposit pricing pressures and a Fed funds rate that appears likely to approach 5% in 2023, we still believe that
we'll reach this range as the cycle matures.
Now to slide 7, disciplined deposit pricing, loan growth and interest rate increases led to growth in net interest
income in the fourth quarter. NII came in at $501 million, an increase of 5% quarter-on-quarter or 28% versus
same quarter one year ago.
The growth in NII for Q4 is supported by both higher loan yields, which continue to outpace deposit calls and the
consistent pace of loan growth, which I spoke to earlier. The net interest margin was 3.60% in the fourth quarter,
an increase of 11 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Supporting them are higher asset yields, which continue to
increase alongside the recent pace of FOMC rate hikes and are supported by spread widening and the continued
growth in our floating rate loan portfolio.
Our funding calls have also increased. The pace of increases in deposit rates has remained somewhat more
consistent and measured than that of the asset side. This time it served to be a significant tailwind to the margin
as we progressed through 2022.
As we look forward to the coming quarters and approach what is likely the latter phase of the Fed tightening cycle,
NIM is expected to be more heavily impacted by the delayed effects of deposit repricing. Assuming rates remain
relatively stable from current levels. Over the medium-term, the margin will be supported by fixed-rate asset
turnover and hedge maturity. And as we enter 2023, NII will continue to be supported by expected loan growth
and pricing discipline.
Slide 8 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $101 million, down $4 million from the previous quarter and
down $15 million when compared to the same period in 2021. Negatively impact in Q4 fee income were two tax
related valuation adjustments, which in combination totaled approximately $5 million and were partially offset by
benefits recognized in the tax provision.
Outside of these tax-related valuation adjustments, we recorded another strong quarter of non-interest revenue.
On the wealth side, revenue generated from clients' movement in the short-term investment has provided a
positive offset to industry deposit pressures. On the commercial side, increasing client privacy continues to be a

key strategic focus. We can point to progress made this year with syndication fees of 59% on a full-year basis
despite a challenging capital markets environment.
On the card side, we crossed a noteworthy threshold as commercial card spend exceeded $1 billion, contributing
to a 20% increase in full-year card fees. Commercial analysis fees are also gaining momentum with strong
pipelines heading into 2023.
Moving on to expenses. Slide 9 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $307 million, up $13 million from
the prior quarter and up $22 million from the same period in 2021, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.
When looking quarter-over-quarter, the majority of our expense growth was attributable to performance-related
costs, investments in new business initiatives and infrastructure spend, all previously disclosed as planned
increases in Q4. Similar factors drove year-over-year expense increases in our top quartile efficiency ratio of 52%
for the year, highlights our alignment between performance and the expense growth.
Next to slide 10 on credit quality. Our credit performance and the credit quality of our originations remain strong.
The NPA and NPL ratios remain stable overall and are at or near historically low levels. The net charge-off ratio
was 0.12% for the quarter, in line with recent levels. In the fourth quarter, our ACL was $501 million or 1.15% of
loans. As detailed in the appendix, given continued loan growth, the ACL increased $22 million quarter-on-quarter
while the ACL ratio remained relatively stable.
This ratio reflects the positive performance of the loan portfolio, offset by a negative bias influencing economic
scenario metrics for 2023 and 2024. We are confident in the composition, diversification and strength of our loan
portfolio. As we recently discussed at industry conferences, when looking further at our exposures that are more
sensitive to recessionary pressures, we remain convinced that our targeted and selective approach to industry
and sector lending will provide protection from an economic downturn. We also feel that we are well-positioned to
detect and respond to shifts in commercial loan performance through tools such as our client-specific cash flow
analytics originally introduced during the pandemic.
As seen on slide 11, the common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 9.63%, reflecting our commitment to retain our
strong organic earnings to support core client loan growth while also maintaining strong capital levels. For the
year, we deployed over 70% of our organic earnings towards supporting core client growth, while also returning
roughly 30% to our shareholders through our common dividend, both consistent with the capital management
priorities we detailed during our 2022 Investor Day.
Looking into 2023, we will continue to prioritize capital deployment toward client growth and we will remain
mindful of the evolving economic environment as we manage within our target CET 1 ratios. Additionally, our
planned quarterly dividend increase of 12% to $0.38 a share subject to board approval reflects our confidence in
our stable earnings profile.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to cover our 2023 guidance.

Thank you, Jamie. Given the more uncertain economic environment, we have utilized wider ranges on estimates
and have shared more detail on the assumptions supporting these estimates. We expect loan growth of 5% to 9%
in 2023, while lower levels of pipeline activity in some business units and a rundown in our third-party portfolio will
act as headwinds.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
We have a number of existing businesses with strong pipelines, as well as newer lines of business such as CIB
that will support overall growth exceeding that of the general economy. We are also assuming a normalization of
prepayment activity and utilization levels that are consistent with those experienced in 2022.
It's also worth noting that pricing discipline is a key focus in the current environment, where pricing power
continues to improve and we therefore expect wider spreads to persist in 2023. The adjusted revenue growth
outlook of 8% to 12% aligns with an FOMC rate that reaches approximately 5% in 2023. The wide revenue range
accounts for less certainty in the deposit environment.
On the fee income side, we expect mid-single digit growth driven by continued expansion in core client fee
income, impacting fee income or checking account enhancements planned to be implemented in the first half of
the year that is estimated to negatively impact annual service charge revenues by approximately $5 million to $10
million.
On the adjusted expense outlook of 5% to 9%, the year-over-year growth is a function of three primary drivers.
First, approximately 40% of the growth in 2023 is associated with core operating expenses. Secondly, we have
two sizable environmental factors affecting our expense outlook. Healthcare cost and the rise in the annual FDIC
assessment rate are collectively forecasted to account for 20% of the overall growth.
Lastly, we remain committed to our investments in new initiatives such as CIB and Maast, which in combination
with other revenue-based investments and projects will comprise approximately 40% of our 2023 expense growth.
However, despite these expense headwinds, we have found ways to prudently trim costs and we are benefiting
from a full year of Synovus board expense saves that will allow us to drive overall positive operating leverage and
PPNR growth of 11% to 15%.
Moving to capital, as Jamie shared, we plan to maintain our same capital management philosophy in 2023 with a
focus on prioritizing core relationship growth and maintaining a strong capital position, all while providing
shareholders with a competitive dividend. While our board approved a $300 million authorization for the year, as
was the case for 2022, any share repurchases will be dependent upon loan growth and the overarching economic
factors.
Lastly, while we don't talk about it often, our tax rate guide of 21% to 23% accounts for a number of successful
initiatives that we have implemented in recent years from affordable housing to solar tax credits. These initiatives
offset forecasted negative headwinds in 2023 and serve a dual purpose of consistently reducing our tax rate while
also benefiting our communities given our focus on driving actions associated with our ESG objectives.
Our strong momentum has carried as well through the first few weeks of the New Year and we are so proud of the
2022 accomplishments that resulted in solid financial performance and meaningful progress in nearly every area
of our transformational growth plan. We are confident in our strategic plan and our ability to hit key 2023 financial
targets outlined today, even as we navigate the volatile economic terrain.
2023 is a year of focused execution for our team as we emphasize investments and pour our energy into three
key areas. First, advancing, successful execution and productivity gains within our core businesses, allowing us to
deepen relationships, grow our client base, and enhance financial performance. Growth in core businesses
enables us to invest in new and future sources of growth, including Maast, CIB and new treasury and payment
solutions. Secondly, continuing to benefit from contributions generated by our new growth initiatives and adding
talent in key businesses and markets to expand our presence and profitability. And then lastly, maintaining a

cautious and resilient risk profile through capital management deposit generation across all lines and overall
credit vigilance.
As we head into the Q&A segment, I want to thank our incredibly talented and passionate team again and affirm
our commitment to providing the best career and workplace experiences possible. In 2022, we progressed in our
DE&I efforts, launched our new leadership development program, increased base pay and enhanced incentive
plans and enrich benefits like parental leave. As a result, Synovus was again named a top workplace in Atlanta
and designated a great place to work. But we cannot rest on our laurels. We're committed to listening and
investing even more in 2023 to meet the needs and exceed the expectations of our workforce.
And I also want to mention a few examples of the success and achievements our lines of business delivered in
2022. Our wholesale banking team delivered record results representing the largest growth engine for the
company, $5.3 billion of funded loan production, $2.3 billion of deposits acquired and $39 million in fee income
highlighted the year.
We also on boarded 55 new team members to support future growth. By focusing on empowering our local
leaders, our community bank returned to a growth orientation in 2022 with both commercial and private wealth
loan portfolios growing for the first time in many years.
Moreover, our geographic banking units continue to serve as a portal of entry and a primary referral source, with
over 6,000 referrals made to other lines of business. Our wealth management units, including securities and trust,
grew fee income $10 million or 7% in a year with significant headwinds from lower equity markets.
However, the teams were able to overcome this, given strong new client acquisition and the expansion of existing
relationships. As referenced earlier, treasury and payment solutions increased production and fees significantly in
2022 driven by success in core cash management solutions as well as commercial card and international
services.
And our consumer line of business optimized our branch network by closing 13% of our facilities while expanding
our digital and analytical capabilities, which resulted in a more efficient and scalable organization. With disciplined
deposit pricing and high single-digit-loan growth, the consumer line of business expanded their PPNR by double
digits. And certainly none of these lines of business results would be possible without the hard work and
dedication of our corporate services support team.
Lastly, I'm pleased with our 2022 efforts to build and strengthen our communities. We launched a meaningful
partnership with Junior Achievement in mid-2022, one component of more than $3 million and 24,000 volunteer
hours invested in our communities across the southeast.
With that, operator, now let's open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to
assemble our roster. Okay, so our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your
line is open. Please go ahead.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Wanted to start first on the loan outlook. If I look at the loan outlook is very strong. Most banks are guiding to
strong growth in average loans for 2023, but not strong growth in period end loans. So I'm curious, what's your
assumption for the economy that underlies the forecast and what gives you so much confidence at this point that
you could deliver mid-to-high single digit growth in period end loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Steven, it's a combination of several factors. To your point, when we look at the economic forecast, there are
parts of the forecast that would show in the latter half of the year that you could see contraction in the economy.
But we believe in total that when you look at our C&I pipelines, first and foremost, we think we will continue to see
good growth on the C&I front. That comes from pipelines, but it also comes from some of the newer businesses
that we've just initiated, like corporate and investment banking, where we really don't have a portfolio to this point,
but we'll be able to continue to generate growth from the new production.
Secondly, we continue to see a constructive environment on the home equity side as well as on portfolio
mortgages. Obviously, that volume is down but when you look at the need for home equity product, given rising
interest rates, we continue to see a good productive environment there. The area that we're seeing a decline is
really on the CRE side. We've seen pipelines decline 60% to 70% and so when you think about this year
compared to 2023, the real difference will be that C&I will continue to grow in a double-digit fashion, consumer will
be in that lower single-digit and then instead of being double-digit for CRE, it's going to be in the low single-digit
for CRE – double digit for C&I, low single-digit for CRE. Part of that's just due to the fact that pipeline is down, but
the other part is we'll start to see payoff and pay-down activities really start to pick up in 2023.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
So when we look at it by asset class and by business unit, we have certain units that are continuing to see
pipelines expand. We've had others that contract, but at the end of the day, you kind of look at all of those, you'll
see kind of a mid-single-digit growth rate next year.

Okay.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, the only thing I would add to that it's just kind of our non-core third-party portfolio. You should expect to see
that attrite as we go through 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful, Jamie. And then for my follow-up question, I look at the net interest margin basically in line
with expectations in terms of the expansion this quarter. But given what you're seeing on the deposit side, right,
you talked about further remix, non-interest bearing. Jamie, how do you see NIM trending in 2023? At this stage, I
recognize it could change in a month, but right now, if you look at where you ended in the fourth quarter, how do
you think about NIM for 2023? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a great question. It's kind of the million-dollar question. As we look at 2023, we expect the margin to be
down marginally from where we ended in the fourth quarter. And basically what will play into that is in the first half
of the year, we do believe that we will see the pressure of deposit lags. We expect like the quarters with the
largest deposit cost increase to be the fourth quarter that we just experienced that we're talking about today and
the first quarter.
And so the first half of the year we'll see the margin headwinds associated with those lags. But how this impacts
the margin will depend on how long the lag is and how deposit cost increase as we go through it. As you know,
longer lags and cost outperformance would be margin tailwinds and the opposite is true with shorter lags and
higher cost.
Our current expectation for the first quarter is that we see deposit cost increase at a little bit of a slower rate than
we saw in the fourth quarter. But we do expect to see in the back half of the year the NIM headwinds that we'll
see in the first half turn to tailwinds as our fixed rate exposures become a tailwind with repricing. And all of this is
contingent on the interest rate outlook. And so our guidance today includes the Fed going to approximately 5%
and holding there consistent with their outlook. And so that's embedded into this forecast.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe just to ask the net interest margin question a little differently, I know last quarter we talked about NII
dollars growing basically in sync with loan growth in 2023. Is that still the right way to think about spread income
dollars?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You know, as we look at NII, looking through the full year of 2023, I would just call it uneven as we progressed
through the year. Our base case for NII in the first quarter is for it to be similar to what we just experienced in the
fourth quarter outside of the impact of day count and so for that, for us that's about $10 million.
But as we progressed through the year, there's just a lot of uncertainty with monetary policy, competitive
pressures on deposit pricing and the timing lags. So, as we look at the full year compared to Q4 annualized, there
are scenarios where you could have NII increasing and that would be driven by longer timing lags, betas at the
lower end of our guidance and our guidance hasn't changed through the cycle of 35% to 40% total deposit beta.
But – and the converse is true to that, faster repricing, higher deposit betas would obviously be a headwind.
11

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
But again like I just mentioned and the response to Steven's question, we do think that the pressures from deposit
costs are going to really be the highest in the first half of the year. But then we have those tailwinds that will flow
through in the second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brady, I'll state the obvious. I mean, you see it in the 2023 guidance, but revenue growth of 8% to 12%,
obviously exceeding that of loan growth. So for the full year, Jamie's talking about relative to fourth quarter but
full-year margin will expand 2022 to 2023. So NII would actually be growing at a faster pace than what loans
would be growing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. Then my follow-up, as I look at last year for Synovus, you had the Investor Day, you
ramped up Synovus board. You had the new initiatives from the corporate and investment bank and also Maast,
there's a lot of kind of new things announced. So as you look at 2023, will Synovus continue to be announcing
some new initiatives or is this more a – we have [ph] or we have enough time (00:31:52) to execute.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, look, I think, Brady, you always have to have an eye on the future and looking for new sources of revenue. So
I'm sure that we'll have some new ideas and things that will begin to develop and initiate on. But as we had in the
back of the document, this is really a year of focused execution.
We believe that we've made tremendous progress in core businesses and focusing on productivity gains and
ensuring that we're getting full share of wallet. Yeah, I was really pleased to see as I said on the prepared
remarks when you look at our deposit production in the fourth quarter, total deposit production was about $2.5
billion.
So first quarter, I can remember that deposit production outpaced loan production. We only had $2.2 billion in
loan production and so there's opportunities to continue to focus on our core businesses to ensure that we're
getting fulsome relationships and that we're delivering the highest level of value to our clients and profitability.
The second part of that is making sure that some of these initiatives that we kicked off during Investor Day deliver.
Obviously in our expense guide for 2023, we have a considerable amount, about 40% of the growth tied up with
current initiatives, and we believe that that's prudent to continue to invest there. Given that as we look at 2023 and
2024 and even 2025, the amount of revenue that's going to be produced by those initiatives will more than offset
the expense and be a major driver in top line growth.
So we want to make sure we deliver on those. But we have a sandbox and we need to think about what are the
new items that we uncover as opportunities to generate growth or efficiencies and that's what we really talk about
within Synovus Forward. We're not going to do a Synovus Forward 2.0 but what we try to do is embed in our
culture the idea of coming up with better ideas to both drive new sources of revenue and to find new efficiencies
and that's just something that we have to do going forward given the economic volatility and challenges that we'll
face.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to touch on the -okay, thanks. Yeah, just wanted to touch on the dividend increase. I think that was
probably a little bit larger than I would have thought. I saw that you – looks like you approved a $300 million share
repurchase program. Just wanted to get some details around that and kind of how active your plan could be as
we move through the year just given that you're within your CET1 range? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we think about the dividend policy, we try to pay out 30% to 40% of our earnings to the dividend. We
think that's a good place to be. We think it's what is right for our shareholders. But we really want to make sure
that we're retaining as much capital generated through our earnings for core client growth. And we believe that
that gives us that flexibility scenarios and scenarios where rates decline and the world changes as well as
scenarios where we continue to grow and that economy remains strong. So that's how we think about it.
With regards to the share repurchase program, that's the same approval as we had in 2022. And as you know, in
2022, we repurchased only 13 million in shares. But our expectation is that loan growth will be slower in 2023 and
we're starting the year at a higher CET1 ratio, closer to the high end of the range. So as we progress through this
year, we're going to monitor our capital ratios. We're comfortable where we are. And as we get to the top end of
our range, as we get to 9.75%, we're going to revisit our share repurchase strategy and that's a point where you
may see us out in the market buying shares.

All right. And then just as a separate follow-up question. Yeah, I think there's been a lot in the news about
commercial real estate and resets as properties come up for renewal. There's an article in the journal about it
today. You know, I often hear from some investors that there's some concern, just you got some third-party loans,
you got a decent amount of commercial real estate. Obviously, there were issues pre and going through the GFC.
Can you just provide some kind of overall context around your philosophy around the credit portfolio, maybe
where you're pulling back and how investors can get more comfort? Just given all the changes that you've made
over the years, as we potentially go through another credit cycle? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Michael, it's Bob. I'll start with that and Jamie or Kevin can certainly follow. But just maybe just quickly go
back to what we said at Investor Day as it relates to sort of credit risk management. Obviously, our intent was to
spread the balance sheet out, building out corporate specialty lines of business. I think that was a key focus for
us.
Secondly was to stay diversified and within our concentration limits and to build those out. I think that's been
accomplished. And then finally and probably most importantly, was to make sure we built out robust credit shops
within our lines of business in the first line of defense with our RMs et cetera, so we've got credit resources deeply
allocated in our business unit. So from a broad context that framework is what we're operating under.
As it relates specifically to CRE, those same sort of overarching framework supply. You know, we stay balanced,
we're not outsized necessarily, we do have $3 billion in office. That gets a lot of attention but if you back out the
medical component of that's about half – within that category, a large percentage is at or near hospitals,
universities. So we like our office. We're not immune to what's going on in our office but we certainly are
comfortable with where we are. Other asset classes are relatively balanced and on the C&I front, that balance
continue.
So that's our guidance from credit, as it relates to policy exceptions and managing within our policy, we certainly
are vigilant about that and we will continue to be so. So I think it's just more of the same but building it out at the
front lines, Michael, and continuing to execute on what we laid out in February, as we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Mike, I'll jump in a little bit here is I mean, we have a very long history in CRE and that's what's getting a lot of
attention today. And as you can see in the appendix of our deck on slide 19, we're trying to give investors the
details they need to make their own assessment on the quality of the book, because we feel very comfortable with
where we are in an uncertain environment.
And that's why you see us looking at the average LTVs, but also the higher LTVs, anything and we're using 70%
which is fairly conservative as a tranche just to give a look into our portfolio. So investors and analysts can come
to their own conclusions but we feel comfortable with our strategy is one we have a lot of history in and it's going
to be – as part of who we were in the past and it's going to be part of who we are in the future. And we feel good
about that. But we try to give all the insights we can into that portfolio given the headlines.

And Michael, a quick follow up to that. We're running internal stress tests constantly on our CRE book and under
severe adverse conditions, et cetera. And we like the way the results of those stress test. We do it by asset
category. You know, we stress a whole host of variables, but suffice it to say that that work's been done and we
feel comfortable that the portfolio can absorb some stress. Again, we're not immune to credit challenges, but we
feel really good about the results of that.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess just circling back on the deposits, the beta performance has been pretty good so far. As we look at that
loan growth expectations, should we assume that deposit growth will match that? And maybe that's where we're
seeing the accelerated beta just bring those in and how should we be thinking about the level of DDA under that
environment as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, it's an a very important question as we look forward to 2023. And I just want to be really clear that as
we think about our balance sheet growth in 2023, achieving the high end of our loan growth range requires
stronger core deposit growth. And so those do go hand-in-hand. But the environment is pretty uncertain and it's
too uncertain that precisely estimate full-year core deposit growth. But we do expect to continue to see the strong
production we've seen in the past couple of quarters and our teams are focused. We've increased the focus on
the teams. We've changed incentive plans. We have deposit initiatives in flight.
And so we think that organic client deposit growth will materialize in 2023. On the environment side, we do
believe that diminishment will reduce as we go through 2023, similar to the trend of reduced diminishment we've
15


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
seen in third quarter and the fourth quarter. We believe the stability and Fed policy both on rate and balance
sheet will allow for a more stable deposit environment.
So all-in-all, our current expectation, again, which is uncertain, that we expect core deposit growth to be in the low
to mid-single digits for 2023 and we expect the pressures that we experience in the last year in 2022 to continue,
albeit a little smaller in the beginning of 2023. So growth is likely going to be weighted to the back half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And so Jared, on the business front there, so two sides of that equation as Jamie mentioned, we're ramping up
production on deposit side. Diminishment is starting to abate a bit. It's important to note when we look at the
balances that we lose in a quarter, about 96% of the balances that we lose are with existing relationships.
So it's not losing deposits, it's not closure. It's folks that are using their cash or in many situations that we had a
record quarter in the fourth quarter of moving money off balance sheet again into treasuries on the securities side.
So there's a lot of money movement that's seeking yield and we think that will continue to slow. That, combined
with increases in production, will help to drive the production and growth that Jamie talked about.
The other side of the equation is loan growth. And I want to be clear that our job is – as we said, is to go out and
deploy capital for our clients and so we're going to continue to be open to originate loans and that's why our 5% to
9% guidance. But the other thing we can do is as we come up on renewals of existing loans or we look at certain
asset classes, we may make the decision that given our cost of funding, we may not renew the loan. If we're not
getting the right level of profitability or particular asset classes, we may decide to downsize similar to what we've
done with third-party given the underlying profitability with wholesale funding.
So, I think you have to look at both sides of it but we obviously are focused on generating faster growth on the
core deposit side and continuing to serve our clients but we have about $9 billion of contingent liquidity through
securities and through FHLB. So we really don't have a funding problem. We have a challenge to make sure that
that funding comes on as cheaply as we can get it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And to circle back to the NIB question, as I mentioned, there's a lot of uncertainty in the outlook, but within
products, I would argue that the uncertainty increases. As an industry, we've seen a significant trend of clients
taking advantage of rates and switching out the DDA. We expect that to continue in 2023 and that's embedded in
our outlook. It's embedded in our beta assumptions of through the cycle betas. But we're also expecting to see
continued strong client growth in DDA that will serve to offset that mix shift I just described. So how those puts
and takes play out in 2023 is uncertain, but our current estimate is they will fairly well offset each other.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just for my follow-up, looking at the expenses guide, it's a pretty wide range and
you had talked about being able to be flexible there. I guess, with the backdrop that there are some increases in
fixed expenses like you said with healthcare and cost of living and FDIC, what are those levers? Where can we
see expense growth moderate if the overall growth isn't there?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
When you look at our expense outlook, first, I kind of want to step back and kind of give components of it. We
have core operating expense increases. So you can think about things like merit and just normal inflationary
pressures and third-party spend, things like that. That's about 30% to 40% of our NIE increase year-over-year.
When you look at our growth initiatives, some of the larger ones are CIB and Maast. That's about 40% to 50% of
our NIE increase year-over-year.
And then we have the environmental costs like the FDIC increase that are about 20% of the increase year-over-
year. So that kind of gives you a breakdown of where the expense increases are coming from. But to your
question around where is the flexibility, the first place I would point is on variable compensation. So in a scenario
where revenues are lower, it is likely that variable compensation will also be lower and that's automatic. It
happens naturally and that's about 15% of our expense base.
Second, in a slower environment, we have the ability to spend at a slower pace on some of our growth initiatives.
And then third, we have the largest expense categories and so that's personnel, that's third-party spend and that's
real estate. And so as you've seen with us in the past, through the Synovus Forward initiatives, we can always go
back and assess opportunities in those areas to reduce expenses.

Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, I'm just kind of curious on the – to extend the funding conversation. How
much can the bond book sort of help you out to the extent you'd like to do that in case deposit growth does fall
short of your kind of loan growth targets, just want to think about whether you plan to shrink that or kind of what
the outlook might be?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Our outlook right now for the securities book is for relative stability. But Kevin mentioned that we have over $9
billion in contingent liquidity available to us, and that includes the unencumbered securities in the securities
portfolio. So if I were to shrink the portfolio by $500 million and get the cash from shrinking it, or if I was to repo
securities at 100%, I could get the $500 million that way.
So it's a liquidity neutral portfolio just given the quality of the securities that we invest in. So when we think about
that, the liquidity is there as it is and so our management of that book is a liquidity play. It's also an asset
sensitivity play because investing in those securities is fairly similar to receiving fixed except for you get a nominal
spread and so that's philosophically how we think about it and we expect, as I said, relative stability in that
portfolio as we go through 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And as my follow-up, you mentioned in your comments opportunities around fixed-rate asset
re-pricing. I think in the deck, 38% of the loan book is fixed. Are there any larger pieces coming up that reprice?
Can you, kind of, give us a sense of what you might pick up? And to the extent does the swap book sort of offset
any fixed asset repricing this year? Just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of where you think the opportunity is
there in terms of kind of fixed rate asset repricing this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. When you look at the fixed rate assets on the portfolio, we have securities portfolio, $11 billion book value
at just over 2% yield. The prepayments on that are slow, maybe around $75 million a month and so that'll be kind
of a little bit of a tailwind, but not as material. I mean, the jump in the fourth quarter was pretty strong and we
wouldn't expect to see increases like that as we go forward.
Our residential mortgage portfolio, a similar duration as our securities portfolio around $5 billion and you look at
that yield in the mid-3s. So as that pays off that will definitely be accretive. And then we have kind of other fixed
rate assets that are approaching or right at $12 billion and those are – there are opportunities for increases there.
Those are not as a material as far as increases as the other fixed rate assets as the mortgages.
The hedge portfolio is a meaningful tailwind and so you can see in the appendix when we put the hedge
maturities in there, you can see that in the second quarter, we have a billion maturing and you can see the jump
up in the remaining hedge yield after those maturities. Those maturities in the second quarter will be about 7
basis points accretive to the margin going forward, just the second quarter billion.
And so we will see a tailwind from that. That benefit will happen in the third quarter and beyond, not in the second
quarter so. But that's how we think about those fixed rates and we do believe that the opportunity is pretty
material as we go through and have maturities and payoffs and pay-downs.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I just was hoping to touch on the revenues. I believe you mentioned in the outlook while you don't have the
separate item for in the outlook. I believe you mentioned in the revenue growth section that you expected to grow
at mid-single-digit pace, I just wanted to check that that's correct and what kind of baseline that's off. And then it
seems like I recognized that the valuation adjustments were probably not expected, but it seems like even
adjusting [indiscernible] (00:52:20) at the low end of the range as communicated just in early December. So just
wondering, was it mortgage or were there other items that were a surprise to you how low they were?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So Kevin, I'll start with the fee income guidance. So, yeah, mid-single-digits is embedded in the revenue forecast
off of a base of roughly $413 million and what that is, we expect to see core client fees continue to grow whether
that's on the treasury and payments solutions side, whether it's on the card side, whether it's on private wealth,
where we've continued to see growth. Those are the areas that we've been investing and that's where we actually
saw growth in 2022.
The headwinds obviously on mortgage although we don't see mortgage rebounding from a production standpoint.
You won't see the year-over-year drag that you saw in 2022. So overall, we feel very comfortable in that mid-
single digit fee income growth level. And then I'll turn it over to Jamie for the second part of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
On the valuation, those are things that we analyze from time-to-time and run scenarios on these deals. And so
there's two different deals that impacted us in the fourth quarter. The first was a new market tax credit deal and
basically what happened there is when we ran the math, that that's something that you basically reduce the
valuation of the asset as you take the tax credits and the tax credits came through and we reduced the value of
the assets. So that's why you see a lower ETR in the fourth quarter as well as an offset.
The other was a solar deal that as we looked at the Forward benefits of that deal, they were reduced and it's still a
positive IRR. It still helps us achieve our ESG objectives, but it is a reduced IRR and so that's why there is a
valuation adjustment on that.

Okay, great. Very helpful. And just – we talked about the balance sheet already, but I just wanted to make sure I
understand. So the loan-to-deposit ratio is just a little below 90% here. So given that the intent is to not
necessarily utilize wholesale borrowings much, but to fund loan growth with deposit growth for the most part,
would you – that ratio to migrate up only modestly over 2023, like what's your comfort level with taking that ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That is our assumption for 2023 is for it to increase moderately and again I think that the philosophy around
liquidity management is similar to the answer that Kevin gave on loan growth. These all move in tandem and we
will be monitoring loan growth in the context of core deposit growth as we proceed through the year. But we're
very comfortable with where we are and there may be times where we choose to use broker deposits to fund
growth. There may be times where we choose to use home loan bank or other sources to fund loan growth. But
the loan to deposit ratio to us is more of an output. But yes, in our base case, we do expect it to increase
moderately.

Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question about from Bob and you mentioned of stress testing earlier.
Does that lead to better pricing on new CRE loans that you have this year and does that contribute to some of the
revenue upside?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Chris, for the question. Yes, I would say the answer is it does – from -as Jamie mentioned in his
remarks, I mean, we think we've got some pricing discipline in the market. We've got opportunity for spread
enhancement when we do deploy capital in the loan account. So I feel pretty good about that.
On the stress test, that was more of a credit quality exercise versus a pricing exercise. But nonetheless as we do
deploy capital, we – particularly in CRE. we've got a little bit of – got the ability to increase spreads slightly.

Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Chris, I'll put an exclamation point on that, to Bob's point. You know, as we look at things like CRE,
construction, what we're doing as an organization is we're increasing the minimum requirements from a
profitability standpoint to be able to do those. And it's not so much to your point. It's not a risk decision, but it's
more of a profitability discussion and to put some evidence behind our ability to generate incremental spread,
when you look at the second half of 2022 and compared to the first half, we saw about 40 basis points of
incremental yield over index for all of our commercial loans. And so I think for a – when you look at risk rating for
a better credit production level, we're getting much wider spreads and that's something that will continue to do
given the higher cost of funding going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you both for that. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up about operating leverage. I know the guide
has it positive beyond 2023, does some of the expense growth that you have this year create flexibility in four
years just to have less expense growth and then maybe perhaps an easier time to get into ongoing positive
operating leverage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, absolutely, Chris. And I'll let Jamie, I'll jump in here quick on this one. So we'll probably fight over who
answers it. So when you just look at Jamie talked about the 40% to 50% of incremental expense increase this
year for just new initiatives, over time, those new initiatives are starting to put off revenue. You'll see revenue
growth in 2023 for things like Maast, CIB, Analytics, new treasury and payment solutions.
The exponential growth in revenue will be much greater than what you'll see in expense in out year. So you'll see
that sort of S-curve with many of these new initiatives and you won't see the same level of increase year-over-
year from some of those new initiatives. So we believe that 2024 and 2025 could be even better from an
operating leverage standpoint just based on those new initiatives.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
I'm also very proud of what we achieved in 2022 and what we continue to build. Enhanced growth, efficiency and
profitability were all delivered during this past year, but more importantly, we produced it in a way that will allow us
to carry this momentum into 2023 and for that matter, 2024 and beyond.
And lastly, I'm proud of the broad-based growth and diversification we are developing in asset classes, revenue
streams as well as our business segments. Equally, I'm proud of the pace of change and the overall agility of our
company, which will enable us to adapt more quickly as the environment changes. And it will change and to
mitigate the challenges and risks that we face as we continue to execute on our strategic plan.
As you've heard today, we have many things working very well and we have many new, exciting initiatives that
are afoot. I also want to personally thank our senior leadership team for your hard work and dedication. You make
all this change possible and your commitment and your drive inspires me on a daily basis. As always, we're
committed to regularly and transparently reporting our progress, and we look forward to and appreciate the
continued partnerships with each of you on the call today.
And then finally I can't close out today's earnings call without thanking Kessel Stelling who officially retired from
our board and our company on December 31. I am grateful for his many contributions to Synovus as well as his
mentorship, friendship and his continued investment in our success as he remains in an advisory capacity over
the next couple of years. And with that, Candice, we'll conclude today's call. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Wishing you a fantastic day ahead. You may now
disconnect your lines.
