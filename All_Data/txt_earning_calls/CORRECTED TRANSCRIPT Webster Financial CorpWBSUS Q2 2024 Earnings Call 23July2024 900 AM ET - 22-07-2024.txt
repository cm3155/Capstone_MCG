John R. Ciulla
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks a lot, Emlen. Good morning and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation second quarter 2024 earnings
call. We appreciate you joining us this morning.
I'll provide remarks on our high-level results and operations before turning it over to Glenn to cover our financial
results in greater detail. There have been a number of important accomplishments since our last earnings call,
including the announcement of our private credit joint venture with Marathon Asset Management, the hiring of
Neal Holland as our next Chief Financial Officer, and the addition of Bill Haas to our board of directors.
The Marathon joint venture is a great opportunity for Webster as it will allow the Sponsor team to better serve and
meet the growing needs of our client base while at the same time enhancing Webster's balance sheet flexibility
and adding a new source of fee income and deposit opportunities. Our Sponsor team will continue to operate in
its existing form, and by partnering with Marathon to fund a portion of our loan originations, we'll gain the ability to
offer larger facilities and additional financing solutions to our existing clients that we would not traditionally hold on
our balance sheet.
We're also very excited about the new leaders we have brought into the company. Neal is a great addition to our
executive management team. In addition to his many talents, Neal brings years of experience leading finance
organizations at large banking institutions. He was CFO of First Republic prior to Webster, having joined their
team in November of 2022. 14 years prior to that, Neal was with MUFG and their Union Bank subsidiary, where at
different times, he served as CFO, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of FP&A of their Americas organization
whose balance sheet was over $300 billion in assets. He also served as CFO of their regional bank. I think you'll
share my enthusiasm as each of you have opportunities to engage with him following Glenn's transition in early
August.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Bill Haas, who joined Webster's board of directors last week, is also a great addition to the company. Bill is
coming off a 38-year career at the OCC, where he was Deputy Comptroller for Midsize Bank Supervision. His
extensive regulatory and risk management background will be tremendous asset to our board of directors. In
combination, these additions illustrate our commitment to investing in the people and processes that will advance
the capabilities of our company as we grow and create long-term franchise value for stakeholders.
I'll now turn to our financial performance for the quarter beginning on slide 2. On an adjusted basis for the quarter,
we generated a return on average assets of 1.16% and a return on tangible common equity of 17.1%. Our
adjusted EPS was $1.26. Our efficiency ratio was 46%. We were pleased to grow core deposits by $700 million
and use a significant portion of the funds to redeem wholesale funding. Loans grew by $500 million or just under
1%, with growth anticipated to continue in the back half of the year.
On slide 3, we recap our unique deposit funding profile where I specifically want to highlight encouraging
developments at HSA Bank and Ametros. At HSA Bank, investments we have made to enhance our technology
via the Bend acquisition two years ago are bearing fruit. We advanced our digital experience, which led to some
significant client wins during selling season this spring and bodes well for our deposit balances next year. These
investments in technology also provide flexibility to improve our solutions.
In the third quarter, we will launch a new investment offering, which provides discrete opportunity to add roughly
$400 million in deposits. In the quarter, we also extended our long-term relationship with Cigna, our largest HSA
partner relationship. Ametros continues to produce the robust deposit growth we anticipated when we announced
the acquisition at the end of last year. Additionally, we will begin offering Webster banking products to Ametros'
member base in the third quarter. This opportunity was not anticipated in our original projections for Ametros and
strengthens the strategic rationale for the acquisition in addition to the value proposition for Ametros' member
base.
On slide 4, we provide an updated overview of our commercial real estate portfolio focusing on the two portfolios
that are capturing most of the headlines. There were no significant changes to the performance characteristics of
our rent regulated multifamily portfolio, where our concertedly underwritten portfolio's performance has held up
really well as you can see by consistently low levels of classified and non-accrual loans. The portfolio is granular,
has conservative LTVs and debt service coverage ratios, was underwritten to property cash flows at the time of
origination and has limited maturities in the next two years.
For office, we also have a portfolio that is granular with conservative underwriting characteristics. As the sector
continues to be challenged, we did have several loans moved to non-accrual, which was the primary driver of the
increase in our overall NPLs this quarter. Office balances were $950 million at the end of the second quarter,
down from just over $1 billion last quarter. In our office portfolio, approximately 75% of the remaining loan
balances have some form of credit enhancement, which adds significant value in mitigating potential losses.
A few important comments to make as it relates to overall credit. Even with the negative risk rating migration, our
NPL ratio, classified loan ratio and annualized charge-off rate in the quarter, all remain proximate to or better than
pre-pandemic Webster levels. Meaning, these metrics remain consistent with a more normalized credit
environment. As we continue to aggressively and proactively manage and review the portfolio, absolute material
change in the environment or unforeseen surprises, we don't see this rate of grade migration continuing in Q3.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Finally, with a 1.3% reserve coverage, our CET (sic) [CET1] (00:07:00) capital accreting back to 11% by year end
and our strong operating and capital generation capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to navigate through
whatever this credit cycle throws at us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to cover our financials in more detail.

Glenn I. MacInnes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the
second quarter. We reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $177 million with diluted earnings per
share of $1.03. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $216 million and
diluted EPS of $1.26. The adjustment was a pre-tax $49 million charge as a result of repositioning of our
securities portfolio.
Next, I'll review balance sheet trends beginning on slide 6. Total assets were $77 billion at period end, up nearly
$700 million from the first quarter. Our security balances were up $165 million relative to the first quarter. The
yield on the portfolio increased 22 basis points linked quarter to 3.86%. In the quarter, we sold securities with a
book value of $962 million and reinvested with a nearly 400-basis-point improvement in yield. The new securities
had a duration of 3.7 years, and we anticipate an earn-back of less than 1.5 years.
The restructuring contributed 11 basis points of the portfolio improvement. We expect it will add another 13 basis
points in the third quarter as yields will fully reflect the restructuring that occurred midway through the second
quarter. Reinvestment of cash flows and portfolio growth made up the balance of the improvement in yields for
the quarter. It's notable that we manage our securities restructuring such that did not meaningfully impact our
capital ratios.
Loans increased $475 million or 0.9% over the linked quarter, with the majority of the growth driven by
commercial categories. Total deposits were up $1.5 billion, with growth driven by interLINK, Ametros and
consumer banking, offset by a seasonal decline in public funds. Loan-to-deposit ratio was 83% in the range of
where we expect to operate over the next few quarters. Borrowings decreased $1 billion as we replaced
borrowings with core deposits from interLINK.
Capital levels improved modestly. The common equity tier 1 ratio was 10.6% and our tangible common equity
ratio was 7.18%. Tangible book value increased to $30.82 per common share, with the increase from the prior
quarter, driven by retained earnings offset by a small increase in AOCI. In a steady interest rate environment, we
anticipate $100 million of unrealized security losses would accrete back into capital annually.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 7. In total, loans were up $475 million or 0.9% linked quarter. Growth was
driven by commercial real estate and C&I. As we said on our last earnings call, we would not expect significant
growth in the CRE portfolio beyond this quarter. The yield on the loan portfolio was flat as we continue to see
mixed shift toward categories with lower credit spreads. Floating and periodic loans were 58% of total loans at
quarter end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 8. We grew total deposits, $1.5 billion, with growth driven by
interLINK, consumer banking and Ametros. When combined, transactional and low cost, long duration healthcare
financial services deposits comprise 45% of our deposit base. Our DDA balances were down $220 million relative
to the prior quarter, as migration to higher cost deposit categories is slowing.

Our total deposit cost was up 12 basis points over the prior quarter to 235 basis points. For the month of June, the
deposit cost was 237 basis points. The increases were the result of clients opting for higher yielding products,
renewals in our CD portfolio and the utilization of interLINK to replace wholesale borrowings. Our total cost of
funds was up a less significant 10 basis points and our cumulative cycle to date, total deposit beta is now 44%.
On slide 9, we illustrate our funding data assumptions. On the left-hand side, we've updated our deposit beta
assumption to incorporate the third quarter, during which we expect our cycle to date beta to hold steady at 45%.
Price competition for deposit has slowed. And over the course of the second quarter, we successfully piloted
small decreases in pricing of certain products. Additionally, we have repriced substantially all our CD portfolio in
the past year and renewals are now pricing below legacy rates. These factors, plus the HSA deposit opportunity
John mentioned in his remarks, will contribute to a slower pace of deposit rate increases.
We've also show our funding beta on the right-hand side, which is a better illustration of the power of our unique
deposit profile. While our utilization of interLINK as a source of liquidity results in a higher deposit beta in
conjunction with our other deposit products, it lowers total funding costs and enhances offbeat balance sheet
liquidity. As you can see this advantage by looking at our all-in funding cost over the last 12 months compared to
peer and industry trends.
Moving to slide 10, we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for
the prior period. Net interest income was up $5 million from prior quarter, driven by balance sheet growth and
higher earning asset yields, partially offset by higher funding costs. Adjusted non-interest income was down $5
million, driven by lower BOLI income and lower deposit in customer hedging activity. Adjusted expenses were up
$5 million and the provision increased $13.5 million. Excluding adjustments, our tax rate was 21.2% this quarter,
up from 20.7% in the first quarter. Overall, adjusted net income was down $17 million relative to the prior quarter
and our efficiency ratio was 46%.
On slide 11, we highlight net interest income, which increased $5 million or 0.8% linked quarter driven by balance
sheet growth and the repositioning of our securities portfolio. The net interest margin was down 3 basis points to
332 basis points as a result of increased funding costs, which were partially offset by higher asset yields. Our
yield on earning assets increased 6 basis points over prior quarter, with loan yields flat and the securities portfolio
up 22 basis points. Deposit costs were up 12 basis points as we utilize interLINK to reduce our wholesale
borrowings. As I previously mentioned, we expect the underlying pace of deposit repricing to continue to
moderate. Total liability costs were up 10 basis points relative to a 12-basis-point increase in the last quarter.
On slide 12 is non-interest income, which was down $5 million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis. There
were a number of components driving the decline, including $4 million in lower HSA fees driven by seasonal
trends and account fees and a $1 million lower benefit from CVA adjustments whose valuation was unchanged
this quarter.
Non-interest expenses on slide 13, reported adjusted expenses of $326 million, up $5 million from the prior
quarter. $3 million of the increase came from a full quarter of Ametros' operating expense and intangibles and the
remaining increase related to investments in technology and increased deposit insurance cost.
Slide 14 detailed components of our allowance for credit losses, which was up relative to prior quarter. After
recording $33 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a $61 million provision, of which $55 million was primarily
due to credit factors and $6 million due to loan growth. As a result, our allowance coverage for loans increased to
130 basis points from 126 basis points last quarter. I would also note we increased reserves in the traditional
office portfolio by $10 million in the quarter.

Slide 15 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, non-performing assets increased $85 million
relative to the prior quarter, with non-performing loans now representing 72 basis points of total loans. As John
indicated earlier, the increase in NPLs was related to four office credits. Commercial classified loans as a percent
of commercial loans increased to 291 basis points from 224 basis points, as classified loans increased by $286
million on an absolute basis. Classified loan increase was concentrated in healthcare and office. Net charge offs
on the upper right totaled $33 million or 26 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis, down modestly
from last quarter's level.
On slide 16, we maintain strong capital levels. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6% and our tangible
common equity ratio was 7.2%. Our tangible book value was $30.82 a share.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 17 with our outlook for 2024. We expect loans to grow by 4% to 5% for the full
year, with growth for the remainder of the year driven by C&I categories. We're anticipating deposit growth in the
5% range with growth in diverse products. We now expect net interest income in the range of $2.32 billion-$2.34
billion on a non-FTE basis, which will effectively leave us flat on a year over-year-basis.
For those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, the FTE adjustment is now expected to be roughly $55
million from $65 million previously. Our net interest income outlook assumes one cut Fed funds rate in December.
Adjusted non-interest income will be roughly $375 million at the lower end of our prior range. Adjusted expenses
continue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.325 billion. Our efficiency ratio is expected to be in the mid 40%
range. We expect an effective tax rate of 21% and we remain prudent managers of capital. Our near-term
common equity tier 1 ratio target is 11%, which we anticipate will achieve by year end 2024. And as you can see,
our long-term target continues to be 10.5%.
With that, I'll turn it back to John for closing remarks.

John R. Ciulla
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. I want to make one final point on outlook. While on an absolute basis, our net interest income
performance has been relatively solid with respect to industry trends, with NII increasing over the last quarter, it
obviously has not been as robust as we anticipated earlier in the year. Our Sponsor business has not grown as
anticipated due to slower private equity activity and competition from the private credit markets and the absolute
level of loan repricings and refinancings in a higher-for-longer environment have been lower than anticipated,
which has had the collective impact of muting loan yields. I want to stress that we've taken steps to stress the
downside risks in our revised outlook, to position us well to deliver results within the new range by the end of
2024.
I want to take a moment to recognize Glenn's outstanding 13 years at Webster. He's been my partner in providing
steadfast execution and a ton of value as we have grown the bank and navigated through some unique operating
environments and a transformational MOE. Consistent with a strong commitment to Webster, Glenn has agreed
to remain an advisor to the company for a period of time. On behalf of our board and our leadership team, I want
to wish Glenn all the best in his next chapter.
We remain confident about Webster's prospects and long-term franchise opportunities as we continue to build
and invest in our organization's capabilities and people. Our return profile and balance sheet strength provide us
with great opportunities to invest in our company and better serve our clients, helping to ensure we remain in a

position of strength with returns at the top of our peer group, a better-than-peer efficiency ratio, strong level of
absolute net interest margin, and a relatively favorable deposit and funding cost profile.
Thank you to all of you for joining us today. Operator, Glenn and I will open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

first question from Matthew Breese at Stephens, Inc.

[indiscernible] (00:20:04).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping you could give us some idea for the margin as we head into year end with some rate
cuts and into 2025. You know, obviously, the balance sheet is a bit more industry neutral. There was a securities
restructuring and then there's still fixed asset repricing. So I was just looking for some frame of reference of where
we might see the NIM migrate to over the next couple of quarters and into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. And so, as I, sort of, indicated in our comments, and John, sort of, touched on as well, we'll get the benefit
of fixed asset repricing going forward, loan growth, as well as the securities repositioning. And some of that will be
offset by what we think is going to be more modest deposit repricing. And I can go deeper on that as far as what
we see. But all that, combined that, I think, we're at $332 million. I think you'd probably expect us to exit the year
somewhere around the mid-330s on a NIM basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, John, maybe you could touch on the commercial real estate NPL pickup. You know, first of
all, you mentioned it was a handful loans, maybe a couple of loans. You know, how many were in there, size?
And then just some idea on resolution and expected loss content would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Happy to, Matt. So, yeah, the credit story, obviously, the headline here looks negative and because we had
negative risk rating migration. But it really was sort of unique to a couple of discrete portfolios, mainly in the office
portfolio and CRE, which as you know, is $950 million. Our NPLs in commercial went up $84 million I believe and
that was the result almost entirely for office loans. So you get a sense again of the granularity, not huge single

point exposures. And so, the rest of the entire loan portfolio is sort of behaved as you would normally, kind of,
slowly migrate into normalized credit.
With respect to loss content, it's awful hard. I mean, what I would tell you is when we're looking at NPLs,
obviously, we do a deep dive. We get updated appraisals. And so all of that is kind of factored into CECL. And so,
what I would say is in our 1.30% coverage ratio, we believe that obviously, we have adequate reserves for any
expected losses. I'd also tell you, it wasn't just a throwaway comment that three quarters of our office loans have
some sort of credit enhancement, which doesn't really factor into the probability of default risk rating, but factors in
our minds into loss given default. So things like debt service, reserves, additional completion guarantees,
extended guarantees from the Sponsor and maybe bootstrap collateral from other property types, we think all will
help mitigate losses.
So again, we don't see loss content really impacting. We still look at our projected annualized charge-off rate in
that 25-basis-point to 30-basis-point range. Obviously, as we always qualify, we say that in commercial lending,
you could have a bigger quarter and a smaller quarter. But kind of as a run rate, we still think our losses are not
going to change as we move forward. We're well reserved and again, we're encouraged by the fact that
everything you see from a credit perspective really in this quarter is a result of what happened in our office
portfolio and a bit in C&I. And I'll just anticipate the next question in kind of our healthcare related and healthcare
services portfolio, which is also under $1 billion.
But as you probably know, industry-wide, that's been a little bit challenged for things like labor availability, wage
inflation, higher input costs and slower reimbursement rates. So, again, we're encouraged by the fact that it's not
a portfolio-wide deterioration, but really in two discrete portfolios that are relatively small and we think we have a
good handle on.

John or Glenn, I'm getting a few questions on the updated NII guide. I think in your prepared remarks, you said
just high confidence, this is the last cut. Could you elaborate, I guess, on what would make it either conservative
or a little bit aggressive at this point?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Chris, that's [indiscernible] (00:24:46). The dynamic here, there's been a lot around, as I referenced in my
comments, a lot around loan yields and obviously deposit costs have gone up modestly. We still have, compared
to industry, favorable deposit costs and favorable funding costs when you look at the peer group or the broader
industry. And what we missed, quite frankly, was, number one, our kind of gem of Sponsor & Specialty having
higher yields at what we believe to be all day long. A better risk adjusted return has really not grown significantly.
We've had a lot of churn in the portfolio, decent originations, but losing the yield on hundreds of millions of dollars
of anticipated sponsor and changing the mix of loan growth and having overall lower loan growth obviously hurt
yields.
There's also the dynamic of refinancings and repricings, which have slowed significantly to our original
expectations and, kind of, perversely, we believe that once the Fed starts cutting that while our repricing down on
existing floating rate loans, we'll obviously provide some sort of headwind. We also think that a lot of the repricing
and refinancings will actually improve the loan yields as we move forward.
So, I guess, if you were to ask me whether it's aggressive or conservative, what I would tell you is I think it's right
in our model, the range. We've obviously adjusted down our expectations of the benefit of repricing and
refinancings. We do anticipate a stronger second half in Sponsor, but we're not relying on a spring back. We have
a higher pipeline and we are seeing significantly more activity there. But we don't know what will happen with
respect to churn in the portfolio.
So, I think it's our best case. And so, if we get a more normalized origination channel and Sponsor and we get
some pickup in refinancing activities, and as Glenn can talk about more with respect to pricing, we have CD's
rolling off at higher levels than new CD's are coming on. We get some moderation. We could outperform the
guide. What could have us underperform the guide is not being able to hit our what we believe to be reasonable
and modest loan growth targets and a continued mix towards lower yielding assets.
And so, this has been a unique environment for us with an inverted yield curve. We missed the mark on the
guidance, obviously, and we're not pleased with it. It doesn't make us happy. We've tried to pressure test where
we are, but we think the guidance range we've given is neither conservative nor aggressive. It's kind of right in the
middle of our updated assumptions based on the trends and the knowledge we know now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And if I can, John, just to add a little bit more on the funding side of it, right. So, we did see the deposit cost
go up 12 basis points and part of that was driven by lower average DDA balances. I would say that's probably
about 3 basis points. As John mentioned, I mean, during the quarter, we had about $2.2 billion in CD's that
matured and then matured at $404 million and repriced at $443 million. That reverses itself as we get into the
third quarter where we have about $2.4 billion in maturing CDs with a weighted average rate of 4.8% and though
we've repriced down to 4.5%. So that'll be positive and will support the NIM going forward.
And then the other thing I would say is that the DDA migration, we saw a $500 million decline in the first quarter.
It's down to $300 million. About half of that $300 million is public funds which come back in in the third quarter.
And so that – we do think, giving those dynamics that both our deposit costs and our funding costs should
moderate going forward.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. And John, if I could on capital, you said 11% by the end of the year, 10% over time. How does that
play out for 2025? Does that mean growth – do you expect growth to pick up and use capital that way? Would you
flip on the buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Well, I think in our – just given our profitability, we should be at 11% organically by the end of this year. And then I
think, looking at the operating environment, the expectation are that things are more normalized, that we've got
good line of sight, that any credit migration has moderated, we feel comfortable about where we are. I think we go
back, Chris, to kind of our general stated capital management program, which is if we have opportunities to grow
our balance sheet organically in good returning assets, we'll obviously accelerate that. If we have an opportunity
to continue to broaden, like in Ametros' tuck-in or do something from an acquisition perspective, we would. If not,
we would absolutely turn back on the buyback and look at the dividend as well. So kind of that's the order of
magnitude.
And right now in our base case, our expectation is that once we crests year end, we're going to have good line of
sight and visibility to where we are. We'll get hopefully some certainty around the path of rates from the Fed and
we'll be back to managing our capital with that longer term, 10.5%, in insight. But we're not going to do that before
we feel very comfortable that we've got a not volatile macro environment.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I noticed the average rate on the interLINK deposits this quarter was, I think, $5.57. Can you help us understand
the thinking around adding sort of $1.1 billion this quarter in interLINK deposits? Do you expect those to reprice
down or any color you could give would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, those are basically tied to Fed funds and it's claim-driven. And so, it depends on the new originations of
that. But absolutely, as we look at the Fed making any kind of move, interLINK is one that would reprice down
because it's indexed to Fed funds. So as the Fed begins to move, those would reprice down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a follow up, and I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but did you mention the $119 million uptick in
commercial non-mortgage, 30-day, 89-day delinquencies? What was that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it was a single credit, Mark, and it was actually at the strong rated credit that just administratively didn't get
fixed and rolled over by quarter end and it was cured the first week in July. So that went away and there's no
credit issue associated with that spike up in delinquency.

So I want to start to go back to the NII outlook for mid and [indiscernible] (00:32:13) I know you said you stressed
it. But if we get two cuts with the first cut in September and then another in December, does that bring you to the

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
low end of the new range or does that bring you below the range? And then, Glenn, in response to Matt's
question, you said the mid-330s exit NIM, but I don't – what if we get two cuts? What does the exit number look
like then?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, just on the first question, let me take it. Because if you looked at our funding and our total balance
sheet, so as I said in the past, [ph] we've got (00:32:49) $61 billion in deposits, about 20% of that I would
characterize as high data products. That's where you [ph] fund it (00:32:57) into like some government banking,
things like that that reprice pretty quickly. So the 25-basis point reduction, you would expect that to come down.
So, take $12 billion, probably you'll get around, say, $8 million a quarter in benefit.
Now the flip side is that, we have about $23 billion in floating rate loans that would also reprice. So that would be
a net drag, if you take those down 25 basis points. And then offsetting that are further declines in like the normal
CD or the normal retail deposits that are eventually drift down. And then, we get the benefit of – we put on
hedges. That's probably beneficial to the tune of like $5 million a quarter once the Fed reduces by 25 basis points.
So if you put all that together, it's probably a net positive on a small basis. So [indiscernible] (00:33:51) think about
$1 million, $1.5 million in a quarter, right, if the Fed were to go in September. So it's basically neutralized. In fact,
if you look at our slide deck on page 26, you can see that we've done a lot of work to sort of neutralize the
balance sheet. And that's – so we're well positioned, I think, for reductions.
The second half of your question, I think on – I think it was on NIM...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Exit NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
...exit. Yeah. And so that again, I think it would be driven by the same sort of factors. And you would expect that
still the puts and takes to that, still you'd get the benefit of the hedges. You get the benefit of the 20% of deposits
repricing immediately, partially offset by the floating rate loans that reset. And so, you'd probably still be in that
mid-330 range on a NIM basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, Steve, rates fee at the high level, just to repeat for the sake of repeating. You know, when we did the merger,
we significantly reduced asset sensitivity naturally in terms of the entire makeup of the balance sheet. And then
with extending duration in the securities portfolio, the hedges we put on and the dynamics, we're significantly less
asset sensitive than we were kind of last – heading into the last rate cut cycle. So that's sort of the first premise.
And then when you look at, to Glenn's point, when we look at the difference between no cuts, a September cut,
September and a December cut, the actual quarterly impact is relatively modest, just given all the inputs and
outputs of the immediately pricing down deposits, the immediately lowering yield in the loan portfolio, and then the
hedging and the other dynamics that we have in our balance sheet. So we don't see that as either a big tailwind or
a big headwind as we look at the second half of the year.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's actually great color. If I could ask on the loan outlook. Because, John, I know you said that
that was one of the drivers of why NII has been reduced. If I look at the midpoint of the new guide, it implies
around $1.4 billion of loan growth at 2024, you're at $850 million at the midpoint. That implies about $600 million
in the second half to get to the guide. Quite a few banks who have weaker loan growth than you in the first half
are guiding to an uptick in the second half. Why are you guys not expecting a bit of an uptick or at least
continuation in the second half, particularly if we get those cuts? Maybe it percolates loan demand a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
You know, it's a good question, right. You've been covering us for a long time and I bragged about high single
digit, 10% commercial loan growth year in and year out. And over the last 10 years, we've done that with the
exception of March Madness last year and the pandemic, right. And so, I get it. And I think, one of the aspects
and elements, obviously, is that we're deemphasizing CRE originations. So that has an impact.
But I agree with you in the build. And that's why we still think that 4% to 5% loan growth for the full year is
attainable. The most granularity I can give you is we're up 1.7% year-to-date in loan growth on a stated basis.
That's 2.2% loan growth in the first half if you adjust for the fact that we took commercial services and factoring
and put it into loans held for sale.
So I do have some confidence that we can do another 2.2%, 2.5%, 3% loan growth in the second half of the year.
And I think if you ask me for kind of the geography of that growth, we are turning on and we have already started
generating some mortgage growth. And we think that now's the time that we can do that, given our balance sheet.
So that'll be a contributor.
Obviously, Sponsor, we think we'll have a better second half than first half. We've got public sector finance, which
has a pretty good pipeline. We have fund banking which although outstandings can be a little fluctuating. You
know, we continue to have really good sponsor relationships and the ability to do that. Lender finance our
traditional middle market, our business banking, our asset-based lending. We still have a whole bunch of levers
that we're pulling on. And we do think that the second half, our gut tells us, will be a more robust loan growth
environment for the industry. But I think, given what we've done in terms of missing people's expectations on NII,
we're not going to overpromise. And so, I think, that our 4% to 5% seems to be grounded in reality and it seems to
be grounded in where we think we have confidence to get there.
Could there be some upside in the second half, particularly with the Fed cutting and maybe with what happens in
November and the election, and people have a little bit more confidence? Sure. And I think that we'll position
ourselves and we're ready offensively, low loan to deposit ratio, lots of deposits and liquidity, we'll be able to take
advantage of it. So I think our loan growth of 2.5% in the second half of the year is our base case best estimate. If
it gets more difficult, we'll scrounge our way to get there. Is there an opportunity to maybe outperform that number
in the second half given macro conditions? Sure.

Okay. If I could just wrap, Glenn, thanks for all the years of providing really great color on the calls. You know,
when I think back 13 years ago till today, I mean, there's no comparison of the company today. And you leave
Webster a big shoes to fill. So thanks. Thank...

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
And maybe just looking at credit and the reserves and just looking at slide 14 with the $55 million provision tied to
macro and credit. You know, during the quarter, I guess, the Moody's base case improved. Is that then just all sort
of due to credit migration within the portfolio? Or are you using a different weighting on some of the Moody's
scenarios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, so, $61 million provision, as I mentioned, does include about $10 million of incremental reserve for the
office portfolio. But I would say the remainder of that, so say, $51 million are increase in reserves. It was a result
of credit risk migration in the quarter. So Moody's, as a whole, from a macro standpoint, was basically neutral
quarter-over-quarter. So most of that was driven by the risk rating migration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, we've been getting lot of questions this past week on what some other banks
are paying on their sweep accounts and people are trying to see how that impacts or how HSA could be impacted
by that? Could you just give an update on how confident you are with the HSA structure in terms of not being

And so, obviously, we've been on top of it working with the HSA team and our legislative team. We do not see
that we would be subject to those new rules.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask on the expense side. You kept the expense guide unchanged while cutting
the NII guide. So, do you see any potential offsets on the expense side as revenues remain under pressure here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think that where we are is – as we think about investing in the business, we think about
investment in risk and our march to category four. We don't see any near-term pressures on hitting our guidance
on expenses. I think we've been conservative in, sort of, keeping that expense base to make sure that we can
continue to invest in the company. I always remind people that we're starting from a mid-40s efficiency ratio,
which is 10 percentage points below our peer group.
Do we have opportunities as things shift in terms of our capital allocation to different business lines? Do we have
opportunities to make organizational efficiencies? We do. We're examining those. But we thought it was
premature to cut our expense guidance at this time. Obviously, as prudent managers, we need to do things to –
we promised market-leading returns over time as there's pressure on revenues, we need to make sure we
rightsize our expenses. I do think we have some opportunities. But at this juncture, given the makeup and given
where we are and the opportunities we see in front of us, we're sticking with our initial guidance. And we'll do
everything we can to bring that in at the low end of the guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I would just keep in mind, given our guidance, if you look at it on either side, the low end or the high
end, it's about $100 million, say, of an increase. And of that increase, about half of that is on the Ametros
platform. So it's the operating expense and the intangibles associated with Ametros. And then the other two
pieces are basically performance-based compensation and investments that we've made in the business, whether
it's HSA or in the commercial business or in the operation side. So, that's the broadbrush of what the increase is.
And I would just point to, that investment in Ametros, as you can see on the numbers and the financials, just
beginning to pay off already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then separately, can you talk about what's driving the decisioning for securities repositioning? You
know, so you are locking in higher rates ahead of rate cut, so you're taking advantage of the lower mark-to-
market, [indiscernible] (00:44:42) capital accretion from each quarter. So, just talk about what's driving the

decisioning and what duration you're putting on, on the securities book? And if you have room to do more on the
repositioning side. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Glenn will give you some of the financial details, but I think you just hit on the number of factors. So
basically, one of our primary objectives is to accrete capital back to 11% on CET1. So I would say that what has
been driving us to opportunistically look at balance sheet repositioning has been the desire for capital neutrality,
the looking at the earn-back period, and you'll see that the moves we've made thus far this year have been really
short payback periods. And so that all factors in and we'll look. Obviously, we have no plans to do anything right
now, but we'll continue to look opportunistically based on all of those metrics, the impact to earnings, the impact to
capital and the earn back period on the move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, the only thing I would add is year-to-date, we've done about $1.3 billion in restructuring. And so the biggest
piece was in the second quarter. But as I indicated in my comments, we're picking up about 400 basis points on
yield and the duration is [ph] staying (00:46:03) around 3.7 years. So, that helps our asset sensitivity as well. But I
don't think that once we start looking at other tranches, the earn-back continues to increase.
So it's something we're monitoring. And we do a pretty thorough job and just looking at the securities portfolio
continuously. But I don't think that you'd expect to see another $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion in the immediate near-
term.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So wanted to touch on the fixed rate asset repricing in the loan yield. So it sounds like you guys are stepping
away from CRE here and are going to be doing more Sponsor finance. And just wondering, the new money yields
in the second quarter versus new money yields, what's in the pipeline currently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So let me just, if I can, Casey, let me just talk about the yield quarter-over-quarter. There's been some
questions about that and so 6.23% versus 6.24%. And as I look at that, like there's headwinds and tailwinds on
that. And so, I think part of the decline quarter-over-quarter was lower loan marks and that was worth about 1
basis point. And then, we did more commercial services up to held for sale. That was also a drag of 1 basis point.
The hedging cost on the CRE portfolio was worth another basis point. And so, those are sort of the big things.
And then, a higher mix to CRE and public sector finance. So you have that headwind going against you. And then
part of what we've seen going the other way are we are seeing like the Sponsor & Specialty book up 17 basis
points, middle-market up 9 basis points, fund banking up 9 basis points. So on a weighted basis, that cost back
about 3 basis points. So that's the dynamics of the net 1 down in basis point, quarter-over-quarter. So for the
second quarter, our total origination coupon rate was like $7.75. And I think that's fairly consistent with where we
were in the first quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Okay. So just to give you like a little market cut. So our originations in the second quarter with respect to Sponsor
being down as well and we had some fund banking growth, a little bit of [ph] CRE growth (00:48:51) public sector
finance growth. You know, you're looking at SOFR plus mid-2s on some of those deals where sponsors were
SOFR plus 3.50% to SOFR plus 4%. And so, the origination yield mix had a significant impact. We do see more
activity. And I would qualify your comment. It's not like we're overemphasizing sponsor. I think we're growing all of
our other asset classes but the expectation is that we'll have more normalized sponsor growth, which has a
positive impact on overall loan yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just the – so the CRE concentration, last quarter, you guys talked about a goal of getting
that – working that down over the next four to six quarters. You also seemed open to divesting of some CRE. Just
wondering what is the current thinking on reducing the CRE concentration and do you get there organically?
And...
[indiscernible] (00:49:50)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great point. I think there will be more than just organic. There will be opportunities. I have nothing to
sort of announce on this call. But if you think about some of the things we're working on, we have agency eligible
loans that we can securitize. We've got interest in continued loan sales, particularly on floating rate, high-quality
loans where they may not be strategic deposits alongside of it. So you can rest assured that all of the potential
opportunities to potentially have step function reductions. And by the way, provide us with more opportunity to

continue to support our existing great relationships with CRE folks. Because we're certainly not out of that
business, but there are ways where we can moderate and keep flat our growth as we accrete capital and grow the
other loan categories.
So I would say that you'll hear us in the next several calls telling you about opportunities that have been kind of
neutral to earnings. Obviously, we're losing earning assets but in terms of not selling at discounts. We have
opportunities to make good economic decisions as we grow other asset categories and free up opportunities to
grow really good CRE with strong relationships and deposits. You'll hear us talk about some of the moves that
we'll make to accelerate and move away from just organic flattening of that portfolio. But yeah, I think we're still on
track to get into that 250-ish range in the next three to four quarters. I think I said last quarter, four to six quarters.
So whatever that is now three to five quarters, we still think we can get to $250 million.
And then we have to talk about and decide as we move forward the makeup of the balance sheet, our origination
and distribution capabilities, because we've got some really good capital markets people and CRE as well. So that
as we kind of march over the next three years closer to category four, whether that and how we get that exposure
even lower between 200% and 250%.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just a quick question on the office portfolio and the migration that we had in the quarter. Just curious if
there was kind of put – maybe you could connect dots in between those four loans if there was anything that they
had in common. I appreciate the data that you have on the New York City exposure, which looks like that was part
of it. But curious, just location-wise, size-wise, anything else you can talk about – of those properties that maybe
connected relative to the rest of the office portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, actually, there were no geographic connectivity. Three were in our kind of branch footprint. One was
outside of our branch footprint with a in-market sponsor. I would say the things they have in common, stress on
rents and NOI and lower appraisals. And so that's what drove that migration. So I would say nothing related to
specific underwriting team or specific pressure in one geography. It's the overall pressure on office and rents
occupancy and value.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Okay, great. And then you mentioned you don't expect risk migration to continue at this pace. What gives you
confidence when you say that particularly, I guess, in the office book, that as maturities continue to [indiscernible]
(00:53:40) that we might not continue to see loans deteriorate there in a meaningful way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Daniel, that's a really good question. And as a former Chief Credit Risk Officer, I always hate to kind of
forecast credit performance. And that's why I qualified the statement by saying assuming that the macro
conditions stay the same and we don't get any big surprises. I think what gives us general confidence is, and
we've talked about this before, Jason and his team have continued to do quarterly deep dives into those portfolios
that evidence the most stress. I mentioned earlier that we still have really concentration in credit pressure in the
$950 million office portfolio. The rest of CRE is actually performing really well and performing actually at a better
rate than overall C&I, which you've heard other people mention on calls as well.
And then within C&I, we sort of have this little pocket of healthcare services, which is also under $1 billion. A little
bit in food and restaurant, which is a relatively small portfolio, but couple of pockets of concentration. And so, with
these deep dives across the portfolio and with our, what I believe to be proactive and conservative risk rating
biases, we don't see if we're going through our problem asset reports as we're looking at things, kind of,
significant deterioration outside of those pockets. And my hope is that our team has captured the current risk
profile in those two portfolios. So, that's why when we look as we do [ph] do roll (00:55:21) rates and we look
forward, we certainly don't see similar migration in Q3.

So, John, you noted the partnership with Marathon will provide more capabilities for clients and allow Webster to
participate and [ph] figure (00:55:50) loan deals that you wouldn't have been able to do so otherwise due to size
limits. I'm just wondering, will you be expanding the credit box to participate in deals? How does underwriting
standard the Marathon compares to the credit culture at Webster?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, the only thing I will say and, obviously, we actually after the announcement we just signed the JV, we
plan on everything going live towards the end of the fourth quarter, maybe the beginning of the first quarter. And
so, I'm not going to comment [indiscernible] (00:56:19) details, but I certainly can answer your question. It should
have no impact functionally on how we operate, how we originate loans, how we go-to-market with our sponsors.
It does give us more balance sheet flexibility and it does give us the ability to continue to move up market and
keep our bank balance sheet hold levels similar, but also be able to do larger transactions because there is a
natural partner to be able to warehouse and hold the higher portions of the bigger loans.
And so, I think the key message for us to you is that it's not going to change the risk profile of the bank. It doesn't
dilute or change our focus on what we're doing for the bank's balance sheet or the bank's earnings profile. It just
gives us more flexibility, optionality and basically, a larger overall balance sheet, if you will, to be able to fund
larger loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then just following up. I know earlier in the call, you did mention some of the pressure in
Sponsor was related just to the increased competition from private credit. Obviously, [indiscernible] (00:57:36) the
JV. Just any comments, anything you can elaborate on what you've been seeing with that increased competition
specifically and the impact on Sponsor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. And I don't think this is a secret to anyone, right. We have seen the proliferation of private credit impact.
We've been in this business, as you know, for a long time. And even going back 10 years, many of our primary
competitors were BDCs, finance companies, sort of, private credit as defined 10 years ago. Obviously, now
there's $1.5 trillion in private credit out there. And so what you've seen the impact on banks overall has been on
capital markets fees, underwriting and syndication because private credit extends. The leverage profile on loans,
they hold larger pieces of loans than are prudent for bank balance sheets to hold. And I would say since March
Madness of last year, there's been an acceleration.
The key for me to talk about is that it doesn't render us non-competitive. Many private equity firms and many of
the ones that we deal with in sectors we know well prefer to deal with banks. There's a different relationship style.
There's different management process. When things go sideways, there's the full capabilities of a bank with
respect to swaps and FX and cash management and treasury products. But it has had an impact on spreads and
it has had an impact on sort of the number of swings we get at the plate.
And so – but I do think that for the first two quarters this year, it's been more activity-based than competitive-
based that's muted growth in that area. So I do think with some of the tools that we're building, we can remain
very competitive with our existing sponsors and continue to grow that business. But there is no doubt that private
credit has become more relevant in the financing space. And I know it's impacting the entire industry.

Operator: We'll go next to Timur Braziler at Wells Fargo Securities.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Circling back to the office discussion, I'm just wondering what drove the updated appraisals this quarter? Were
the loans coming up for maturity or was there something else? And then maybe just provide an update for the
remainder of the book? What portion has recent appraisals on it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I didn't catch the last part, but I'll ask you for that again. You know, the first part is just the general normal
processes, either risk rating, migration, certain levels of debt service or approaching maturity that we will order
appraisals, and then take into consideration the entire value of property NOI debt service coverage in terms of
making a risk rating determination on accrual or non-accrual. So that's a standard operating procedure. What was
the second part of that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just what portion of the office book now has updated appraisals on it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I'd say maybe 40%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the HSA business, the migration from deposits to investments seems to
be accelerating maybe here a little bit. Can you just talk through that dynamic and just remind us how you
monetize the investment component of HSA?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Obviously, in a higher rate environment as well, we have seen migration. We always remind folks that if you
look at the dynamics of the various spenders, savers and investors, that investors still have significantly higher
average deposit balances than spenders. So as people continue to invest while that takes some deposits away
from us, that the underlying deposit base of those investors is still very, very strong and profitable.
We make significantly more money, particularly, in this rate environment on a deposit than we do on an
investment. We have taken steps, and I mentioned in my comments, to continue to have investment offerings that
are not only and most importantly, better experiences for our clients, but also that give us slightly more
economics. So we're moving in the right direction. But at the end of the day, we make a fraction of what we make
on deposits based on the value of deposits now than we do on a dollar of investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add, Timur, is that, our business like 3 million accounts, about 2 million or 75%, I'd
say, are still spenders. So they have an average balance of [ph] $475 (01:03:03). Right. So and then if you go to
the saver profile, they have an average balance of about $8,000. And then the investors are only 8% of our
account. So, and that's up to your point. Very good point from 5% a year ago. But they still maintain an average
balance of like $6,000 and they have a $20,000 investment balance. So we still get the benefit of the funding
advantage on our balance sheet. I think the opportunity for us is obviously to educate the spenders on the
benefits of savings, the triple tax-free nature of it, such that they become more savers. And so that's – and I know
that's something that Chad and his team always have been focused on.

Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Glenn, I just want to say congrats and best wishes. So my question is
really sort of multipronged around commercial credit. Not to beat a dead horse here, but just want to understand
the $61 million loan loss provision, less the $6 million growth, so down to $55 million, how much of that
specifically was office? How much of that was also your...

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
...Sponsor & Specialty. And then I know you mentioned that the Office reserves grew by $10 million. What is your
specific office reserve now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So let me take it one at a time and John can jump in here. So of the $61 million, as I indicated in the comments,
about $10 million is office, right, of that $61 million. And I think on the sponsor book, I don't have the absolute
dollar number, but I know our coverage ratio was up 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
It's 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Exact 2%. I'm sorry. [indiscernible] (01:05:13) add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. So but just $10 million was office and you said obviously, you had credit risk migration. So that's only $10
million of your $61 million in loan loss provision was related to office, is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, Laurie, if you think about it, we already had ratings on those non-accruals. We're likely in substandard
already or had specific reserves against them. So at the end of the day, that's the incremental reserve amount for
the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Perfect. Perfect. Okay. And your Sponsor & Specialty book. What are the non-performers there now? And then
just one last follow-up on charge-offs. The $33 million that were commercial, how much of that was office? And
then or even if you have the split between CRE and C&I, obviously, how much was office and then also how
much was the Sponsor & Specialty?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Can you repeat that question, Laurie?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
The second question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Sure. Yeah. Of your charge offs of $33 million in – it was mainly all commercial, $33 million in charge-offs. Just
looking for the split between CRE and C&I and then just also specifically, what were your office charge-offs and
what were your Sponsor & Specialty charge-offs? And I mean, just the Sponsor & Specialty non-performing
number that I had from last quarter was $135 million. Just want to make sure I have a refresh there. Thanks so
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So we had total charge-offs in the quarter of $33 million. $10 million of that were proactive loan sales, mostly in
CRE. And so, of the actual kind of liquidating charge-offs, normal course charge-offs, we basically had a
traditional office loan, we had a loss in ABL and a small loan in Sponsor of $5 million. So that's the makeup of the
charge-offs, which were actually down from last quarter.

Operator: We'll move next to Samuel Vargas (sic) [Varga] (01:07:29) at UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the loan and deposit guide for a second. On the loan growth, I
appreciate all the color you've provided so far this morning. Can you just, I guess, name sort of some of the
categories that you're most confident in for the second half of the year loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure, I will. And before I do that, I'm actually going to answer Laurie's last question. Even though she's not on the
phone, the NPLs in Sponsor were flat for last quarter. So that same number you're looking at, Laurie, and I
apologize for you getting cut off there.
Yeah. I mean, I think we have, as I said, if you look and I think Steve made the comment, it's somewhere between
$850 million and $1.4 billion in that 4% to 5% range in terms of what we would need to do in the second half of
the year. There's no one concentrated category, but if you think of a few hundred million dollars in mortgage as a
start and a contribution, a couple of hundred million dollars in lender finance, a couple hundred million dollars in

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
fund banking, a little bit more in traditional middle market C&I, and then some smaller but material amounts in
public sector finance, and then contribution from ABL and business banking, I think that's how we build that. So
it's not either throwing the bomb or putting emphasis on one category, it's using the portfolio of leverage we have
to have kind of diversified and robust loan growth.
As we said, there may be – CRE will be bounced around, maybe flat, could be up a little bit depending on the
actions we take. But it'll be a pretty diversified loan growth with maybe the additions from last couple of quarters of
some more originations for holding in our residential mortgage but kind of the same categories that have been
contributing and hopefully, a more robust Sponsor quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks for that. And then just switching over to deposit guide. Is it fair to look at the deposit guide as a
derivative of the loan growth guide? And you don't want to put on extra liquidity if you're able to drive more
deposits? Or are those two more of a separate thought process for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, I think that's fair. It is the pricing anyway. And therefore, the deposit balances are driven by the funding
nature of the loan book. So yeah, we manage it that way along with broker deposits and wholesale funding as
well. So, those are the dynamics we look at.
I think as you look at the guide, like I said, the costs will moderate. That's how we're thinking about it right now.
So, there's opportunity for us. And I think when you look at that second or third page of our deck, you can get a
sense of the diversification and the levers we can pull to optimize that mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And interLINK is the real lever, the other deposits we want, right. Regardless of what loan growth, the strength of
our franchise is growing core operating deposits. So we want HSA to maximize its growth, Ametros to
supercharge its growth. And we want all of our middle market and commercial real estate and commercial and
business banking activities and our retail bank to continue to grow good relationship deposits at reasonable
prices.
So that's really not a factor of what we see available to us on the asset generation side. That's a factor of
continuing to grow the value of our deposit franchise. But I do think Glenn's right as it relates to what we look for
with respect to interLINK growth or other brokerage CDs or other things, that would be a function of deploying that
liquidity for asset growth.
