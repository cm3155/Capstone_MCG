MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analyst conference call for
HSBC Holdings plc earnings release for the first quarter 2021. For your information, this conference is being
recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Thank you, Jean. Good morning in London and good afternoon in Hong Kong. I've got Ewen with me
today. I wanted to start by sharing on screen our purpose, ambition, and our four strategic pillars to focus on our
strengths, to bid by the scale, to energize for growth, and to lead the transition to net zero. I will return to these in
a moment. But first I'll run through some highlights before Ewen takes you through our financial performance.
We've had a good start to the year. I've seen excellent energy within the business. Strong collaboration and a
determination to get things done for our customers. I'm very grateful to all of my colleagues for the way they've
managed growing demand since the turn of the year and for the single-minded way they've helped our customers
to capture both present and future opportunities. Now, many parts of the world where the pandemic remains a
very real part of people's lives.
Our thoughts are with the people of India in particular and we're working hard to support our colleagues and
customers in India through this very tough time. In terms of our financial performance, our good business

performance supported by a net release of expected credit losses delivered reported pre-tax profits of $5.8 billion
which were up 79% on last year's first quarter. We strengthened our lending pipelines across our personal and
commercial banking businesses, which bodes well for our future revenue. Our cost and RWA programs remain on
track with $443 million of quarterly cost program savings, and $9 billion of gross RWA savings in the quarter. And
we retained a strong capital ratio of 15.9%, with further growth in both deposits and lending.
Pointing out a few highlights on slide 3. The combination of our digital campaigns and growing customer
confidence saw strong credit card sales growth in Hong Kong. We saw a good mortgage growth with drawdowns
up 60% in the UK and 37% in Hong Kong. Our wealth strategy got off to a strong start with 23% growth in overall
wealth balances. We attracted $13 billion of net new money into private banking in the quarter and $11 billion of
net new money into asset management.
We saw a good loan volume growth in commercial banking, and month-by-month increases in lending approvals,
with nearly double the approvals in March of any one month in 2020. Global Banking and Markets had a good
quarter supported by strong current activity in capital markets. We led more than $567 billion of capital markets
financing across global debt and equity markets and syndicated loans. Including around $40 billion, our social and
COVID-19 response bonds which is around 29% of the total market. This was a global performance with good
profitability in all regions. And growth of $3.2 billion in profits booked outside of Asia compared with last year's first
quarter.
Moving to slide 4. I said in February that our growth and transformation plans were already in motion. And you
can see the evidence of that here. Under focusing on our strengths, we've already grown wealth balances in Asia
by 18% year-on-year. We've grown our Asia wealth FTEs by more than 600 including around 100 new client
facing wealth planners in Mainland China. And we've grown trade finance lending in Asia by around $3 billion
mainly in China and Hong Kong.
Under digitize at scale, we've started to integrate our market leading PayMe app in Hong Kong into merchant
checkouts. And officially launched HSBC Kinetic for SMEs in the UK with around 6,000 customers already signed
up. Under energize for growth, we're applying all that we've learned through lockdowns combined with our digital
investment to improve the way we work. We move into a hybrid model wherever possible giving our people the
flexibility to work in a way that suits both them and their customers.
We will need less office space as a result. And we have a plan to reduce our global office footprint by more than
3.6 million square feet or around 20% by the end of 2021. We're also relocating three of our global business
CEOs to Asia on a permanent basis, taking them close to our customers and to the core of our business.
On the transition to net zero, we published details of the climate resolution that we'll put to shareholders at our
AGM in May. We are one of the founder members of the Global Net Zero Banking Alliance that launched last
week. We maintained our leadership position in sustainable finance following a record quarter for Global ESG
bond issuance, and we're piloting a new tool in the UK to help SMEs better understand their ESG performance
and to prepare to take action. It's early days but we're carrying good momentum into the second quarter. Ewen
will now take you through our results.

Thanks Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. We had a good quarter against the backdrop of ultra-low rates,
reported post-tax profits of $4.6 billion, that's up 82% on last year's first quarter and an annualized return on
tangible equity of 10.2%. Adjusted revenues were down 3% on last year's first quarter, largely due to the impact of

ultra-low interest rates but there were notably good performances in some segments including Asia Wealth and
Wealth and Personal Banking, Asia trade finance and commercial banking and capital markets and advisory, debt
trading and equities, and global banking and markets.
Relative to the first quarter of 2020, adjusted revenues also benefited from the reversal of negative insurance
market impacts and global banking and markets valuation adjustments. Expected credit losses had a $435 million
net release. This reflects both an improved economic outlook for our central scenarios, and in the UK and the US
lower probabilities attached to downside scenarios.
Operating expenses were up 3%. This was due to a shift in variable pay accruals to reflect quarterly profitability.
We remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable costs for the year ex the bank levy subject to final
decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year. Lending and deposit balances were both up 1%, with
confidence in higher loan growth in the remainder of the year. Our core Tier 1 ratio remained stable at 15.9%, and
our tangible net asset value per share of $7.78 was up $0.03 on the fourth quarter, with retained profits more than
offsetting negative reserve movements.
Turning to slide 6 and looking at first quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses. In Wealth and
Personal Banking, revenues were down 1% on a year ago. Wealth management revenues grew by just under $1
billion due to the turnaround and insurance market impacts from a big loss last year and a good performance in
equity and mutual fund sales in Hong Kong. Personal banking revenues fell by $890 million due to the impact of
low interest rates on deposit margins.
Commercial banking revenues were 14% lower due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on global liquidity
and cash management, but with a good bounce back in trade balances in the quarter and growing confidence in
the lending pipeline for the coming quarters.
In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were up 10% with strong performances in global debt markets and
equities, up 52% and 55% respectively. And Capital Markets and Advisory up more than 100%. Just to remind
you, we have no significant exposure to SPACs where some peer banks benefited from exceptionally high activity
levels in the first quarter.
On slide 7. Net interest income was $6.5 billion, down 14% against the first quarter of 2020 on a reported basis.
On rates, the net interest margin was 121 basis points, down 1 basis point on the fourth quarter, primarily
reflecting the fall in HIBOR during the first quarter.
On volumes, we saw continued good volume growth in mortgages in both Hong Kong and the UK, and strong
commercial applications that we expect to translate into volumes in the coming quarters.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year. Despite some continuing rolling impact of last year's shift in interest
rates, we expect volume growth to support net interest income at levels broadly in line with the first quarter.
On the next slide. Net interest income was $6.8 billion, up 15% against last year's first quarter. But noting last
year was negatively impacted by volatile items due to COVID-19. Overall, net interest income stabilized in the
quarter compared with falls over the previous three quarters.
Wealth and Personal Banking and Global Banking and Markets benefited from higher volumes, better equity, and
mutual fund sales, and stronger capital market activity. FX revenues were down year-on-year but this was still a

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
good performance against an exceptional first quarter of 2020. Commercial banking was down slightly, reflecting
lower trade and payment volumes due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 on activity levels.
Looking forward, we expect customer activity and fee income to continue to recover as economic activity
recovers, although this obviously remains subject to the impact of new COVID-19 variants and the continuing
success we've seen to-date in the roll out of a global vaccination program.
On the next slide we had a net release of $435 million of expected credit losses in the quarter. This compares
with a $3.1 billion charge in the first quarter of 2020.
The net release was across all global businesses and reflected an improvement in the economic outlook, notably
in the UK, including a reduction in downside probabilities. Last year's first quarter included a large charge related
to one single name corporate exposure in Singapore. But this year's first quarter was still very benign for Stage 3
charges particularly on the wholesale side.
We retained ECL uncertainty overlays of $1.5 billion, broadly the same as the fourth quarter, recognizing the risks
that still exist from the pandemic. But based on the current economic outlook, we now expect the ECL charge for
the full year to be below our medium term through the cycle planning range of 30 to 40 basis points.
Turning to slide 10. First quarter adjusted operating costs were $220 million higher than the same period last
year. This was driven by higher performance-related pay accrual of $474 million primarily due to a shift in
accruing a higher percentage of variable pay this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020. We made a further
$443 million of cost program savings in the quarter with an associated cost to achieve of $319 million. To-date,
our cost programs have achieved annualized saves of some $2.2 billion against our target of $5 billion to $5.5
billion with cumulative costs to achieve spend of $2.2 billion.
We're not softening our vigorous approach on costs. We continue to expect our 2021 costs to be broadly in line
with 2020, excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy. This is subject to final decisions on our variable pay
pool later in the year, which will be primarily driven by the pre-tax profitability of the group.
Turning to capital on slide 11. The impact of profit generation in the quarter was offset by fair value movements
and other deductions including around 10 basis points for foreseeable dividends. As a result, our core Tier 1 ratio
was unchanged at 15.9%. In line with our shift to a payout ratio approach going forward, the deduction for
foreseeable dividends was based on one quarter of the 2020 $0.15 dividend. We expect to make the same capital
deduction in the next two quarters based on the same trailing dividend assumption.
But to be clear, we're not signaling with this our 2021 dividend intentions. Excluding FX movements, risk weighted
assets fell by $6 billion in the first quarter due to changes in – to our portfolio mix and methodology and model
updates. To remind you, we do expect some core Tier 1 headwinds going forward from regulatory changes.
These haven't changed from the full year.
So in summary, against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates, this was a strong quarter for us. Our best in
reported profit since the onset of COVID-19 and an annualized return on tangible equity of 10.2%. While the
results were flattered by a net release of ECLs, we saw strong performances across various parts of the bank with
continued strength in Asia despite the impact of a very low HIBOR and a material recovery in profitability outside
of Asia.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
As we look out, there remains heightened levels of uncertainty particularly driven by the continuing emergence of
COVID-19 variants. So, expect us to retain a conservative position on capital funding and liquidity for the time
being. However, based on the first quarter performance and the strengthened economic outlook, Noel and I are
more optimistic about this year albeit cautiously than we were at our full year results in mid-February.
With that Sharon, if we could please open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Ed
Firth, KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Ed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I just had...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
I guess one or two questions actually, if that's okay. I didn't expect to get on first, little bit of a surprise, you caught
me out. The first question was on capital. I was sort of surprised that the capital ratio wasn't stronger given the
earnings beat and risk weighted assets falling. And I just wondered if you could give us some more color around
that. I think it was a minus 400 – minus 40 basis points hitting the chart, exactly what's driving that and how we
might expect that to progress going forward. I guess that was the first question.
And then the second question was restructuring charges seem to be running some way lower than you were
perhaps informally guiding to anyway at the full year. Should we expect those to pick up during the rest of the
year? And can you give us sort of any color on how that might end up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, look on the restructuring charges, we're not changing our full year guidance we gave at full year results.
You're right, Q1 was unusually low. So yes, you should expect those to pick up as the year progresses.
On capital, yeah, a few things. There were deductions for fair value reserve movements on cash flow and
negative FX movements. There was a higher deduction for BoCom as its profits increased and again note that we
talk about a 10 basis point deduction for the foreseeable dividend which is new for us that will represents a
change in policy because we've shifted to a payout ratio policy.

That's not – there's not a sort of underlying...

Your line is open.

Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on margins. And you gave a color on this during the
call. But just to dial in on your major regions, just to understand, how much of that is kind of lower rates feeding
through, previously lower rates and slightly lower HIBOR? And is there anything on competitive pressure that's
drifting those margins down, or is it all about the background yield curve and rates?
The second question is just on the write-back actually. So, it does look like a lot of the write-backs are from the
UK, particularly UK commercial. A, is that right? Were they mainly UK commercial? And, B, what did you see that
was driving that? Was it an outlook on the vaccine rollout, or was it specific data points that you were seeing on
the UK corporates, or UK personal if that was the case? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On NIM, it was I think almost exclusively driven by the shift in yield curves. So, I mean what we're actually
seeing, yeah, we broadly re-priced all of our liabilities now. And on the asset side, actually, we're seeing some
opportunity for margin expansion. So, for example, in the UK, we increased margins to try and slow down some of
the inflows that we were seeing. And we have for several quarters seen some opportunity to re-price in Asia on
the commercial side. So, we do think that we are now close to troughing on NIM. I mean, obviously HIBOR
slipped a little bit further in Q1. But as you know, that translates very rapidly into the books given the short-dated
nature of assets and liabilities in Hong Kong.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
And for net interest income, yeah, loan growth in Q1 was sort of mid-2%. And we're signaling that we expect mid-
single-digit growth over the full year. So that does imply much higher growth rates and lending volumes in the
remaining three quarters which we've got confidence in given the pipelines that we can see which should help
support net interest income over the remainder of the year even if there is still some residual NIM pressure
coming from the roll-off of books as a result of last year's interest rate shift.
On write-backs, you're right. There was a larger write-back in commercial particularly in the UK commercial. I
think in part that reflected the very large reserve buildup that we had last year. Look, overall, there were sort of
various things going on which made this an unusual quarter for us. Firstly, we had very low Stage 3 losses around
about $300 million or so in the quarter, which was unusually low we think. And secondly, on Stage 1 and Stage 2,
two things really, an improvement in economic forecast for central scenarios and most places that we do business
coupled with as you know we went into the full year with very large probabilities particularly in the UK against
downside scenarios which we have reduced on the back of a very successful vaccination program here.
And we would expect we're also seeing that in the US and we would expect to see that in other markets as the
vaccine programs ramp up elsewhere.

ahead. Your line is open.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Good morning. Can you hear me okay?

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Great. And my question is – thank you for the questions. My question is with the Wealth and Personal Banking
rationalization in France and the US. I was just wondering what the appetite might be to use released risk
weighted assets and potentially excess capital to add portfolios in your other markets where it might make sense,
noting here that a large global bank has put up consumer balances in about 13 markets. So, I'm just wondering
where your view is with where markets might open up in those geographies, where HSBC might think it makes
sense to be bigger rather than smaller? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. As you know, our primary focus in the WPB business is to grow our wealth part of that business. And
therefore, we are looking at opportunities for both organic and bolt-on inorganic opportunities but it's primarily

focused on wealth businesses either acquiring products or distribution capability in wealth management,
insurance in private banking. That's the primary focus rather than just the geographic expansion of retail banking
capability. So we're more focused on that for opportunity. And it will be Asia-based largely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Great. Thanks. So, essentially the way that we should read that there's going to be no balance sheet bolt-on M&A
that would consume any excess capital. It's really just you're focused on organic strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, we would use capital to do an M&A deal, but it would be – it'd be what we're buying is less retail banking
assets, more wealth management capabilities. So we will use up free – we will use freed up capital if we see bolt-
on acquisition opportunities. But as I say, it's more around wealth management capabilities than it is retail banking
capabilities. We will look at opportunities as they emerge.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And I would use – make sure you listen to the word bolt-on. We're not sort of planning anything substantive. So
yeah, will it eat into some of the excess capital? Yes, but it will be relatively modest if we choose to do anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
That's understood. Can I maybe just ask a quick follow-up on that. So, having said that and just bearing in mind
your comments from last quarter [ph] surrounding (26:54) not to expect buybacks this year, could you perhaps
paint the path for us towards returning excess capital which HSBC is clearly building?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So I mean, I think we've been clear on our distribution policy. Certainly, our dividend policy we said we're
going to shift to a 40% to 55% payout ratios from next year. That's going to be all cash. This year we're going to
transition towards that. We will close to an 80% payout ratio last year.
We do expect subject to seeing how the second quarter goes to be in a position to pay an interim dividend in the
middle of the year. And then re-evaluate whether or not we'll shift to quarterly dividends from – at the end of this
year.
On buybacks, look, we continue to have no current intention to do buybacks this year. You know that we've used
buybacks in the past, so they're certainly something that we do and do actively consider as a tool of capital
management. And we are committed to active capital management.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
We do think at the moment that, yeah, when we look at consensus versus where we are, we do see RWA growth
probably being a tad higher than is in most people's models. We see loan growth being fuller than I think all of you
currently are currently modeling. That's on the back I think of, yeah, very strong growth that we continue to see in
mortgages across the UK and Hong Kong, a commercial pipeline that is building nicely. And just in context, in one
of the slides, you'll see that our commercial pipeline is running close to 50% higher than it was in Q4 in Q1. And
we do think other segments like consumer credit will bounce back as we recover out of COVID.
There are about $20 billion of regulatory headwinds that we see this year. Offsetting that, there's the sort of $30
billion or so of RWA rundown that we expect. We're making good progress on that. We did about $9 billion in the
first quarter.
And the last thing is we're still cautious on credit rating migration, particularly as some of the government support
packages roll off, for here in the UK for example as furlough rolls off and what impact that has on credit later in the
year. So, yeah, we are probably slightly more cautious on capital and excess capital than would be in your
numbers at the moment.

Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Just two questions, please. First on credit quality. You obviously released $0.7 billion from Stage 1, 2 reserves in
Q1. I think you flagged $6.8 billion still left on balance sheet. And your guidance, if I take the bottom of your
range, I know you're saying you could be below, which suggests a sort of full-year charge of somewhere around
$3 billion or lower. I just wonder, that guidance in itself, what does that imply in terms of further Stage 1, 2
releases for the rest of 2021? And then, I know you've already touched on this, I was going to ask you to then just
expand on your thoughts about when the government programs actually do end, what's your thoughts on sort of
releases over two- to three-year period? That was the first question. And I have a second one on costs, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Well, look, on ECLs, I mean, I said in my opening remarks that we've retained uncertainty overlays of about
$1.5 billion. So, we think we're retaining currently about 70% of the reserve build up in Stage 1 and Stage 2. If we
were to stick to the central economic scenario, I would think you would see some of that get released this year,

maybe some of it get released in the first half of next year. I think we're going to continue to be pretty cautious
about how we do release.
We're not expecting a repeat of Q1 in terms of further ECL performance during the remainder of the year. And
there still is a pretty broad array of outcomes I think depending on how we progress out of COVID. And,
obviously, there are a few risks on the horizon, particularly around new variants and whether any of those become
vaccine resistant. So, yeah, where we land below 30 basis points we'll see. But you should assume that within
that, that we are confident that we will end up below 30 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, you know as well, it's important that we adopt a cautiously optimistic approach to reserves and the way
the economy will develop. We're optimistic, we're seeing good signs but it's still relatively early days for the
vaccination program. That's why we wanted to retain around 70% of the provisions that we created last year.
We've had a very good Stage 3 quarter in Q1 with only $300 million of Stage 3 charges. That's below the normal
trend line that one would expect. So, I think it is right to be cautiously optimistic and continue to position the
balance sheet cautiously.

Okay. Lovely. Thanks. And just on costs. Your comments on broadly stable for the full year barring further
performance-related issues, I mean, if I looked at last year and I just took Q1, it was very neat 25% of the full year
total ex the levy. If I annualize Q1 this year, I'm looking at sort of 3% growth. I'm just trying to get a feel for where
your confidence is coming from. Is this just incremental cost savings or are you really building in an expectation
that this performance related pay is going to push us away from that broadly stable? I mean, if it is performance
related, that's not a bad thing either necessarily. But I'm just trying to get a feel for how confident you are really on
that broadly stable target. Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So look, in the first quarter, there was about a $300 million to $400 million adjustment due to us taking a
higher accrual for variable pay compared to Q1 last year. So, I think if you back that number out, what you'll see is
that we were broadly flat costs in the quarter. And you would expect the variable pay accrual [ph] other than
(34:54) being equal to be a few hundred million dollars lower for the remaining quarters of the year, which I think
gives you confidence in that statement.
We're always signaling on the variable pay accrual, I think what we saw in – as part of the full year results as you
would all know, there was a very different approach across the sector in terms of performance pay. We took our
pool down by close to 20% for the full year. But we saw some peers, particularly US peers and particularly some
European peers who were concentrated on the wealth and investment banking space, pay in very different
places.
So, we're just cognizance of the fact that for competitive reasons we may need to top up our current pool
assumptions as the year progresses. But that would only be down on the context of improved profitability. But
absent that change, and again, in context, we paid about $2.8 billion in variable pay last year. So, you can do your
own math and size what that risk is. But absent that, we're very confident that we're on track to deliver broadly flat
cost this year. And I would stress, there's no change at all in the internal management focus on the cost program.

Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Good morning or afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two. Firstly, on RWAs and then just
briefly to come back on costs. I just wanted to check, on the RWAs, your commentary that you see RWAs being
higher than consensus, is that a reference beyond 2021? Just as we look at Q1, quite encouraging quarter, you
can take the FX and grow sales. So, given where we start Q2 further growth stage to come. It didn't strike me that
consensus looks particularly high on 2021. But perhaps you're more cautious in terms of credit migration and the
volume growth. I just want to check if it's a 2021 or beyond sort of story there.
And then second question just on costs, sort of come back to your commentary on performance score. I think
originally you used to said it would be driven by PBT, so I am just interested was that more weighted to pre-
provision profit or to impairments for [ph] materially low (37:21) below medium-term cost of risk? That could be a
factor or is it more sort of competitive pressures that you just talked to that would drive that? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, variable pay is set on, yeah, largely on bottom line profitability but we do take some – yeah, for
example, last year I think profits fell by around a third and we took the variable pay pool down by 20%. If we saw

the reverse go this year and it was largely driven by ECL outperformance, I don't think we would take all of that
outperformance into a change in variable pay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Correct. And if you remember we – what we're managing to is leaving VP to one side, we're on track and
confidence of our ability to deliver the transformation cost savings that we talked about in February and the
February before that. So the underlying cost position of the bank is well-positioned and on track to meet those
expectations.
We've had a strong profit performance in Q1 and therefore, we've topped up the VP for the Q1 performance. We'll
have to see what happens in Q2, Q3, and Q4. But the most important message for you is we're on track for our
underlying transformation cost savings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the question on RWAs, yeah, just in terms of 2022, again, I think we would be confident of achieving,
yeah, mid-single-digit loan growth. We've probably got another 20-or-so-billion to go in our RWA reduction
program next year. But then, you will have, yeah, Basel III reform coming through, which will probably lead to a
4% to 5% uplift in RWAs next year. So, if you – I don't know how that compares with consensus, but broadly that's
what's in our head at the moment.

Goo morning. And I just wanted to come back on the point on costs, please. I just wanted to understand more
how it will evolve going forward. Because from what you're saying it sounds as if to the extent that revenues are
being led by areas like wealth and markets that will drive potentially higher variable compensation and therefore
higher expenses than you've been guiding for. But am I right to say if revenue growth hands off to more balance
sheet-led type NII and commercial banking we wouldn't see that?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, Manus it's always going to be a mix of our internal metrics of what we think. We can't afford based on
the profitability of the group, but we can never be uncognizant of what's going on in the market. So, if we are
seeing competitive pressure in areas like Asia wealth and investment banking more broadly, yeah, we have to be
in a position to respond to those competitive pressures. But I think your statement is right to the extent that, well,
what you see is a rebalancing of profitability being driven out of the commercial bank and the retail bank that won't
necessarily drive the same competitive pressure on performance pay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Manus, the only other thing I'd say is when we talked about our future growth fronts in February, we assumed a
growth in revenue coming – in tracking back to 10% RoTE-plus, we had a rebound in ECLs. We had further
performance on cost takeout. And we had a reboot of revenue from a reboot of the economy and incremental
activity that we're investing in. So, we had assumed revenue growth going forward in 2021 and 2022 and beyond.
And therefore, we had assumed a growth in profit and therefore we had assumed the growth in variable pay to
match that path. And that was all inherent in the cost statements we made back in February. So, we have put into
our future forecasts a growth in VP to match the growth in the P&L that we expect to see.
What I think you saw in Q1 is a particularly strong performance in Q1 that was over and above that underlying
curve that gets us to that 10% RoTE. Now, if that over performance continues in future quarters, then maybe that
assumes growth in VP will be higher in the future than was in that original assumption, but so too would be the
PBT and so too would be the revenue. So, I don't assume there isn't a growth in VP inherent in the plans that
underpinned the journey to a 10% RoTE. Does that make sense?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. It was hard to hear you but I think what you were looking for was more of an indication of where the growth
in wealth is coming from. And let me also be clear, we started that journey of investing in our wealth businesses
last year. And that was investing in a build out of our product capability to make sure we had good product
capability on the shelf in Asia and an investment in distribution. So we launched the Pinnacle initiative in China as
an example.
But we were also investing in private banking, in our insurance business. We were investing in both physical
manpower to drive that growth in the wealth managers. But we were also investing in digital infrastructure. So our
insurance business in Hong Kong particularly, launched a lot of new initiatives last year, new products, digital-
based, supported by extra salespeople. And that's what's been driving the growth of our wealth revenues in Asia.
I would – it's not just market sentiment or market valuations that are driving that growth. It's actual underlying
growth that's coming through. Now, we still have more to do. We recruited an extra 600 wealth managers in Asia
in the first quarter alone. 100 of those in China as part of an expansion of our Pinnacle opportunities. The
converge – where are we getting the business? Where – how are we sourcing the wealth opportunity?
Well, I'm pleased to say we're sourcing a lot of it from our existing client base. Around about 60% of the net new
money that goes into our private bank, it comes from commercial banking clients, and global banking clients. The
owners of those businesses are putting their personal wealth with us. The same is true of asset management.
Around 75% of the net new money for asset management is coming from internal HSBC clients.
So, it's true organic growth at an underlying level, not just growth in assets as a consequence of market
revaluation of those assets. There is an element of that in Q1 as markets revalued but it's – there's a lot of it
coming from underlying growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Yafei Tian Q

Thank you. Would it be possible to give us some guidance in terms of the wealth revenue growth outlook into
percentage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
We talked about our revenue growth outlook in February. We're assuming – for Asian wealth we're assuming
close to double-digit growth in assets, as we said in February, and mid-single-digit growth in other regions outside
of Asia. And that would result in probably Asia wealth revenues to grow at around about 10% CAGR over the next
few years.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thanks so much for taking my questions. The first one is just on loan growth, loan demand. I was trying to
understand a couple of points. Firstly, how sustainable do you think this current activity spike in the UK mortgage
market is? Obviously, you along with all of the UK banks have benefited from very strong mortgage pipelines and
pricing. So, just wondering, tying that into your overall comments on loan demand, what you're assuming happens
to that for the rest of the year.
And then just related to that, I suspect there's an element of pent-up demand in other areas of loans in the UK as
well as probably across your footprint as well. So, to balance that out, if you could talk a little bit about where you
see pent-up demand in loan growth. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. Let me deal with the consumer book first, the retail banking business first. I think in the UK it's true that there
is strong activity at the moment. There will undoubtedly be an element of that which is driven by the stamp duty
holidays that were put in place that are likely to come to an end shortly. But I also believe there is some structural
changes taking place in the UK, in that the housing market in the UK I think will remain active for quite a period of
time as the housing stock is continued to be built out. So, I think there's an underlying growth curve there and
there's a potential temporary growth curve as a consequence of the stamp duty holiday.
I think we'll see a pickup in activity on consumer lending, unsecured lending and credit card activity in the second
half of the year not just in the UK, but across the world. If you just take our own balance sheet, we grew last year

our deposit balances by around about $170 billion last year. Now, an element of that $170 billion will turn into
cash spend by consumers and businesses in the second half of this year – or will start – already started but will
continue to pick up. So, I think you're going to see traditional unsecured lending and credit card activity see an
increase in the second half of this year.
Hong Kong remains strong demand on mortgage growth and we're pleased on that. More broadly into the
wholesale business, what I saw at the end of last year particularly in Q4 was a lot of activity from corporate
borrowers seeking facility renewals or facility extensions to get ready – to get their balance sheet ready for the
upturn in the economy as they started to see vaccines come on stream. But I didn't see that translate into loan
drawdowns in Q4 of last year. I have started to see that take place in Q1 of this year. So, for example, the trade
balance sheet in Asia grew by $3 billion in the first quarter of this year. That's an indication of underlying
economic growth. If the vaccine programs continue as they currently are, you could assume that that trend will
continue and could well pick up.
And then, more generally, there was a starting to see a drawdown in those facilities that were negotiated at the
end of last year taking place in Q1. So, overall, our commercial banking balance sheet grew by $2 billion in Q1 of
this year. And our personal banking loan book grew as well. So, I think it's early stage of growth, and I could
expect the trend to pick up as over the next three quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thanks very much. That's really helpful. I was wondering if I could have one more on capital, just a very quick
clarification. I was wondering if you have any further thoughts on the stress testing timeline this year, and if there's
any scope for regulatory restrictions in the UK to come off earlier for yourselves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, I mean, I think you know that there's a sort of current mini stress test being done by the Bank of England
and the PRA, and that was in the absence of them having done an annual cyclical scenario at the back end of last
year. As we sit here today, I guess we're not expecting any surprises out of that given we've been extensively
stress testing our books through the pandemic. And in recent months, obviously, outlook has improved. So, we're
not expecting the Bank of England at this point to be – we're expecting us to be the driver of our distribution policy
I guess is the better way of describing it.

Hi, Martin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yeah. Hi, Ewen. Hi, Noel. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a follow up on earlier comment on margin
outlook from here. And I was just wondering if you could maybe shed a little bit of light on how we should think of
a NIM progression here for the main business lines, so [indiscernible] (53:18) Hong Kong Shanghai Banking
Corporation, and in particular the UK ring-fenced bank. I was just wondering if it's fair to assume that the bulk of
rate cut impact has by now [ph] flagged (53:30) through in Hong Kong and from here we should see stability and if
anything at some point [indiscernible] (53:37) and that if anything ,some of the remaining margin pressure is
coming through from structural hedge rollover in particular in the UK.
And I was just wondering should we assume margins to remain broadly flat in terms of 1Q level what we have
seen, or is there – is your guidance of I think you said earlier that 1Q NII is broadly representative of the full year if
I missed that, right? Does that imply that combined with loan growth, you would expect some further margin
compression heading into 2021?
And then just a follow up on capital, I was just wondering if you could update us on how much progress you have
made in addressing capital inefficiencies within the group. Whether if you could let us know how big the principal
investment book is at this stage and what portion of transfers into Asia has occurred so far. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the NIM question, I mean, you know, Martin, that not all of our interest rate sensitivity is in the first year.
I mean there is a degree. We talked about previously about a $1 billion of interest rate pressure coming lower
rates into 2021. And then obviously, HIBOR did drop meaningfully in the first quarter, has remained broadly stable
in the second quarter at the levels of the first quarter so far that we do think we are getting towards the trough of
NIM pressure.
But it would be a big call to say that Q1 was the trough. I still think there will be an element of pressure into the
second quarter and then obviously volume growth then provides us confidence that the impact on net interest
income is negligible. The other thing I would say about the growth that we'll be back end loaded as we go
progressively through the year. And as confidence builds during the year and therefore you won't get much – as
much of that benefit into 2021 but you will get all of that benefit into 2022.
So, I talked about earlier assuming that the Q1 net interest income was a good guide to the annualized net
interest income for the full year. But you should take away from that therefore that we're also confident about
decent net interest income growth into 2022. On Hong Kong, most of the impact of lower HIBOR gets translated
into our books within three months. So, equally the reverse is true if we were to get back to a better short-term
HIBOR curves we would see that very rapidly translate into improved net interest income in Hong Kong.
I'm sorry I didn't quite catch the second question.

...multi-year program of work. Yeah, we've got for example probably $5 billion plus of excess capital in the US that
will come out we expect over several CCAR cycles. There's various capital optimization opportunities that we're
working on in Asia, which will take a few years to effect. So I would say it's a sort of multi-year program of work.
We know what that program of work is and we're just progressively working on them. And some of it is driven by
sort of ongoing discussions with regulators. And I think the confidence in regulators to see capital release coming
out of places will obviously improve as we see a stronger path out of COVID.
