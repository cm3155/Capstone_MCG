Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
2020 was a defining year for TriState Capital. Total revenue, net interest income, and non-interest income
reached their highest annual levels in the company's history. We grew total loans and deposits by double digit
rates for the seventh consecutive year as both our private banking and commercial banking businesses
responded in exceptional ways to meet our client's needs. Our Chartwell Investment Partners asset manager
delivered strong performance during the year and leveraged its excellent distribution capability to grow assets
under management and dramatically improve its profitability in 2020.
I'm very proud of how our three businesses and each member of this company worked together during an
extraordinary year to deliver for our clients and shareholders. The results of their efforts prove what we have long
said that this company is designed to outperform in any environment. And while 2020 created challenges never
seen before, it also significantly accelerated the growth and progress of many significant parts of our business.
Bolstered by the additional capital we secured in 2020, we are well-positioned for meaningful success in 2021.
Chartwell continues to be the largest contributor of our non-interest income revenue. It delivered very strong
investment performance in 2020 and leveraged its exceptional distribution capabilities. Assets under management
now exceeds $10 billion, expanding organically by 6% from the end of 2019 and 34% from the market's trough on
March 23, 2020. By comparison, publicly-traded asset managers as a group saw declining AUM through the third
quarter of last year. Positive net flows of $152 million across our institutional and retail businesses in 2020
compared to net outflows of $771 million in 2019. Chartwell's run rate revenue as of year-end was nearly $36
million, up 6% during the fourth quarter. And the success of our strategic efforts to sustainably enhance Chartwell
profitability is paying off. Chartwell in 2020 grew annual net income by 15% and fourth quarter earnings by 89%
over the year prior.
As we begin 2021, Chartwell's institutional new business pipeline stands at $115 million in unfunded
commitments. We have high expectations for Chartwell and its ability to contribute to the overall company's top
and bottom lines in 2021. Our marketing and distribution support for its investment strategies continues unabated.
As just one example, we're focusing significant marketing efforts around Chartwell's short duration, high yield
product. This strategy is uniquely positioned to perform in this environment and attract both institutional and retail
clients. And with nearly $2.8 billion in assets under management, the short-duration BB discipline combines
critical mass with solid, long and short-term track records making the strategy very attractive for our business.

TriState Capital Bank also continued to outperform in 2020 delivering robust annual total loan and deposit growth
of 25% and 28%, respectively. We achieved this meaningful growth through deep and expanding relationships
with our private banking and commercial bank businesses. Private banking loans grew by $1.1 billion or 30%
during the year to $4.8 billion at year-end. These loans which are primarily collateralized by marketable securities
make up more than 58% of total loans, and we see ample runway to continue growing this business and
dominating our position in this market.
Private banking loan applications in 2020 were up 60% year-over-year, almost twice the rate of growth in 2019,
and we expanded our referral network to 249 financial intermediary firms. This business contributes meaningfully
to our company's exceptional asset quality metrics and low credit costs.
Commercial loans grew 19% during the year and an annualized 29% during the quarter through broad-based
growth in many of our strategies. Commercial and industrial growth during the quarter outpaced our real estate
lending with continued strength in established and enhanced products, including equipment finance and our
offerings for financial service companies. Commercial real estate lending continued to grow meaningfully as we
supported our existing and new clients.
Turning to credit, the quality and depth of our commercial lending relationships and our fundamental underwriting
are also important factors in our sound credit quality. Our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate
portfolios remain well diversified by product as well as by geography. We historically had limited exposure to
some of the businesses that have been more negatively impacted by COVID-19 like hotels and shopping centers.
Additionally, we are pleased that the overwhelming majority of our clients we work with to provide COVID-19
deferral agreements were able to exit these arrangements prior to year-end. We have 13 remaining deferrals as
of December 31 totaling $84.5 million or 1% of total loans. As planned and previously communicated, we adopted
CECL as of December 31, 2020, and reported an allowance for loan losses of just under $35 million.
Representing 101 basis points of commercial loans, our reserves reflect our differentiated and high-quality loan
portfolio.
Our loan growth was matched by strong deposit growth reflecting continued progress in the strengthening and
broadening of our overall client base and channels. We achieved record annual deposit growth in 2020 and
delivered annualized quarterly deposit growth of more than 14% for the three months ended December 31.
Treasury management deposits grew nearly 36% during the year, and an annualized 32.5% for the fourth quarter.
Our strong loan growth and deposit cost and volume management contributed to our expanding net interest
margin in the fourth quarter, and more importantly supported record net interest income of nearly $138 million in
2020, up 9% from 2019. Quarterly net interest income grew more than 30% annualized from the linked third
quarter, and our margin expanded by 7 basis points during the fourth quarter. This strong net interest income
growth along with performance of Chartwell, continued swap fee activity, and fees from our growth and treasury
management services led to 7% annual total revenue expansion to the company's highest level yet.
With 2020 in the rear view, our confidence in our unique business model has been reinforced. It was tested and
proven, and we're eager and optimistic about the significant opportunities ahead. Having raised more than $200
million in capital in 2020 alone, we're well positioned to accelerate TriState Capital's growth in 2021.
More specifically, we're focused on the following financial performance goals in 2021: growing total revenue at
15% to 20% rate over 2020; managing expense growth to a double-digit rate over 2020; continuing to generate
positive net asset inflows at Chartwell; continuing to expand Chartwell segment profit margins; continuing to grow

net interest income dollars through volume and net interest margin expansion; organic loan growth of 15% to 20%
while maintaining superior asset quality; and organic deposit growth of some 15% to 20%.
Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to introduce TriState Capital Bank President and CEO, Brian Fetterolf, who will be
touching on technology initiatives underway, which we anticipate will have a significant impact on our success in
2020 and beyond. Brian?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone.
Well, as Jim mentioned, we wanted to share with you a deeper dive into our bank's technology strategy and
investment approach including what we have planned for 2021. These are all also included in the financial goals
that Jim shared this morning.
As a quick backdrop to investment decision process, we always start with addressing why, what, and how or as
our favorite phrase from Jim would be, what needs to exist to make it happen. I reorder these a bit here for this
presentation though.
So, to start off, why do we invest in technology? It's important to note that our clients and financial intermediary
network are at the heart of every decision that we make. We are constantly driven to meet and exceed their
needs and expectations and find every feasible way to accomplish this, as we prioritize our investments that
provide clients with the user experience and level of personal interaction that they prefer, help them to more
effectively manage their business and financial lives, and make it increasingly easier for them to do business with
us, refer business to us, and engage more meaningfully with us.
Our high performing team and culture are major differentiators for us to achieve these standards of client
experience. We're always looking for ways to improve our ability to personally engage with our clients and
meaningful needs and through continuous process improvement. We accomplish this guided by our continuous
goal for best-in-class scalable, operating and risk management platforms to not only protect and benefit our own
business, but also those of our clients and relationships as well.
So, how do we invest in tech? Well, our agile tech strategy is a major tool we use to meet these goals and help
each of these stakeholders. We believe our technology investments have strong return because we target them to
directly maximize our competitive advantages, help us address our more complex and value-add markets, target
niche user experiences and empower our branchless business model. Also, we approach our tech development
strategy using a design model which maximizes our internal expertise and provides us access to best-in-class
external expertise.
We work with the perspective of our premier clients. We overlay our industry expertise in our niche markets that
have developed over the life of our company. And we acquire exceptional product design and project
management capabilities to create the most impactful solutions. We ultimately outsource the actual tech and
software development phase by partnering with top firms to deliver on our design vision. So, we believe that our
approach is the most cost-effective framework to deliver the best customized solutions, feature scalability,
maximum optionality, and minimum legacy constraints for the future, and Jim has talked a lot about dealing with
those in the past.

What have we done so far? As we've shared with investors before our proprietary PARIS technology empowers
us to deliver premiere risk and compliance management through daily monitoring of the securities and
collateralized or private bank loans. This was a game-changing investment early on in the life cycle of TriState
Capital that dramatically contributed to our ability to dominate this business in the independent channel, growing
loan balances by 277% just over the last five years and growing even more significantly the number of clients,
intermediaries and loan book at that time.
Our investment in our treasury management tech platform has positioned us to compete with the services and
experiences provided by the best-in-class large banks, while maintaining our focus on high touch with our clients.
Since we initiated our specialized focus on growing this business in 2016, we have delivered the scale and
customization for clients with operating balances ranging from $1 million to over $200 million. In addition, our 36%
TM deposit growth in 2020 alone, we've grown the number of TM clients by over 400% – [ph] Tri-TM
(16:33)accounts by 400% and TM clients by over 100% just since 2016 alone.
We've also talked about the release of our digital lending platform for our private bank lending. We designed this
to position the financial intermediaries and our clients for better liability management in parallel with their
investible asset management. We designed the DLP to provide the independent broker dealer advisory and trust
company channels with a securities-based lending experience that exceeds what they might have or actually may
have had for those transitioning advisors at a wire house or bank-owned securities firm.
The DLP has been totally embraced and private bank applications increased by a record 60% last year compared
to 2019. The DLP was also integral to how we were able to communicate and help these advisors work with their
clients to manage the market volatility in 2020 with perfect maintenance execution. We're continuously improving
each of these platforms, but clearly they then establish us powerful for the future and establish our ability to be
agile and effective investors in technology.
So what are we going to do next and what are we going to invest in? Well, we couldn't be more excited as we look
forward to 2021 and beyond. As Jim mentioned, 2020 accelerated many aspects of our business and these
accelerations confirmed the business and use cases supporting our rapid and impactful investment in tech
solutions.
Some of the highlights for our 2021 initiatives include our PARIS 2.0 which is our 2020 to 2022 initiative primarily
that reinforces its state-of-the-art functionality and performance, but also enhances and scales our analysis,
monitoring, and loan origination capabilities for the huge opportunities we see ahead of us.
Our expansion of our front-end technology is continuing with particular focus on self-service, self-analysis, and
communication capabilities for the private bank lending through the DLP and our treasury management and high
net worth deposit clients through online banking.
Through an initiative we introduced in 2020, we are growing the robotic process automation in our middle and
back office and our risk and compliance management environments with the goal of being entirely digital.
We are enhancing our commercial loan system by partnering on development with Fiserv to facilitate our growing
commercial and private bank loan portfolios, support our growth in more specialized products such as equipment
finance and fund finance that Jim mentioned, and more efficiently service our growing opportunities to agent
lending transactions for our larger clients.

And finally, through an initiative introduced in 2020, we are building out our data management and analytics
capabilities through enhanced, modern and scalable technology platforms as we look to help our clients and
partners as well as us to capture revenue opportunities. This is really powerful now especially as we reach critical
mass in the numbers of clients, transactions, and engagement in our business.
These technology plans mentioned are incorporated into the 2021 financial goals that Jim shared this morning
and they're a significant contributor to the positive operating leverage that we see in 2021, and they're a
significant contributor to the development and growth of our business on the top line. We have a great team of
innovative people working on delivering this. We are pleased with our success so far. We're never satisfied with
where we are, but we are more excited than ever by the potential we have.
With that, Jim, I'll turn it back to you.

James F. Getz
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, Brian.
We are well-positioned to deliver even stronger performance moving forward as we sustain our investments in the
proprietary technology and superior talent that distinguish us from peers and the industry. TriState Capital was
built to endure and we firmly believe that this company's best years lie ahead.
I'd now ask the operator to open up the lines for questions and answers. Operator?

Matt Olney Q

So to start with, I guess with the adoption of CECL, would love to hear more about expectations for provision
expense in 2021 and obviously, it's going to be a function of loan growth. But just want to understand other key
7

factors that could impact this especially with the unique loan portfolio that TriState has with the private banking
loans. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, we're pleased with how our investment in the talent and our unique culture in terms of our approach
to credit pays dividends in terms of the strong credit quality we have. Because of that discipline and the
investments we make, we expect our annual credit costs will remain well below peers. Our allowance, as Jim had
indicated, stood just below $35 million at year-end. We've not seen any notable defaults or losses emerge to date.
And as Jim indicated, our clients continue to navigate the current mixed economy quite well. And so, while we
remain comfortable with our credit book and are proud of the history of only $34 million of charge-offs in the past
10 years, we want to continue to make sure that we're well positioned to handle any potential issue with respect to
the economy and things that may emerge.
We provided guidance in 2020 with respect to provisions primarily because of CECL implementation and our
election to defer that implementation. I don't think we're going to provide concrete guidance this year. I would tell
you that we would expect credit costs to be significantly lower in 2021 versus 2020. And the primary factors that
we focus on in driving that determination are anticipated improvements in unemployment and anticipated
improvements in GDP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Matt, this is Jim. I would also indicate to you that as one of our financial performance goals, we noted that we
foresee the loan portfolio growing 15% to 20%. And we fully believe that the private banking portfolio make up
about 60% of this portfolio with the end of the – at the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, shifting over to other financials. It looked like the
tangible book value per share was higher than my expectations and I think the consensus as well. Any more color
you can give us as far as the tangible book value per share as of 12/31? And is there any more incremental
dilution or impact from the capital raise in 1Q or are these fully captured in the 4Q number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
No, it should be fully captured in the 4Q number, Matt. What will change between Q4 and Q1 is the number of
average shares outstanding, which will impact some of those calculations. The average shares outstanding will
probably move up near 32 million shares outstanding for the first quarter versus what was probably closer to 29
million in Q4.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much.

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Hi, Dan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to talk about the margin, net interest margin. You saw some nice expansion in the fourth quarter with
deposit costs coming down and loan yields hanging in there as you mentioned that they would. Can you talk
about what you expect to see from here kind of assuming a similar rate environment? Do you still expect it to be
able to get back to the 170% range by the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Daniel, we do. As you saw, we were able to deliver on what we shared with you last quarter which was margin
expansion in the fourth quarter. I think Jim mentioned that margin expanded 7 basis points. Even in this flat
environment, we do see expansion in 2021 primarily driven by deposit cost reduction. So, where you were at,
about 67 basis points on deposit costs in the fourth quarter, we see that dropping to low-50s by year-end and
anticipate the average for the year will be somewhere around 55 basis points.
On NIM specifically, we see a NIM of approximately 170 basis points by year end for the bank and probably in the
mid-160s for the holding company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. And I would just add to that, obviously, NIM is a function of asset size as well – deposit size as well as the
rate. So obviously, I think what we've demonstrated in 2020 was our ability to raise liquidity when we wanted it.
And then also to manage those levels of liquidity by working really highly engaged with our clients. So our goal in
2021 is to continue to match liquidity with our ability to put it to work, but yet really meaningfully grow our deposit
franchise we have. So, I think there are two levers there that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter that we'll
continue to be really good at in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's terrific. This is more of a modeling question, but the other non-interest expense line ticked up a little bit
more than I expected in the quarter. What was in that – what's the driver of that increase?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Daniel, if you'd allow me to step back and just put extensions and context for the year, then I'd be happy to
answer your question. It's important to start with the mandate we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year
which was the [ph] chief (27:00) expense growth under 10%. We were able to do that – we achieved the lowest
expense rate growth in our company's history since 2013. We were able to do that while making investments to

build and grow our company, invest in people and technology, focused on regulatory compliance, and delivering a
distinctive client experience.
Revenue was a bit challenged in 2020 which led to some higher efficiency ratios. But with the growth in revenue
that we anticipate and our focus to drive operating leverage in 2021, we expect to grow expenses by about 10%
to 12% and naturally drive a lot of operating leverage, which will improve the efficiency ratio and the ratio of non-
interest expenses to average assets. With respect to other expenses specifically, there are a couple things in
there. The provision for unfunded credit costs given the CECL implementation drove some of that increase.
Expenses associated with the tax credits, as you highlighted in your piece last night, drove some of those
increases. COVID-19-related expenses drove some of those increases. And then to a much smaller extent, fees
associated with running a larger investment portfolio and volume-driven loan expenses drove some of that
increase as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Dan, this is Jim. What you want to keep in mind is that we're still building this company for the future stone by
stone. So, you'll notice on our income statement we – and it's the reason why we – Brian just went over what he
did with you. We highlight ongoing technology. And for our business to continue to grow dramatically, we really
have to gear up the technology that we need to put in place along with the people. And that's where we're
investing at this time. You'll see the expense on compensation having gone up. We've hired about 39 new people
this year alone. But we're also investing in the robotics that Brian indicated that we can complete a lot of the
mundane tasks that the people have been completing in the past.
When we put this company together and started doing as a private banking business, it was a paper-driven
business. Now, it's a technology-driven business. Thanks to the investments that we've made and you take a look
at our growth that we're experiencing on the commercial side. We've linked up with the right partner in Fiserv and
we're actually partially underwriting their investment in the development of a new system for our commercial
lending area and all that's contained within that technology number that you see in front of you there.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
I appreciate all the color so far. I think it's an interesting discussion, right the technology investments, but the
future scalability of it all. And I know, David, you mentioned that you guys expect to improve the efficiency ratio
and I think that that makes sense when you kind of look at everything you laid out, but that also doesn't seem like
maybe the best metric to kind of look at the company relative to peers, right, because of the AUM business which
I know runs a little higher. So I'm just curious you can maybe spend a second telling us a little bit more about how
you think some of the scalability that you guys expect to experience in 2021 should impact from other return
metrics like ROA and ROE and how we should think about the improvement in this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So Mike, as we think about ROA and ROE, we'll likely see ROE increase before ROA. We believe that yields on
interest-bearing assets will be range bound for a period of time here, particularly as we grow investments at a
same – similar rate as loans. Earnings will grow from sort of what we describe as a responsible growth strategy
and will generate return on the capital that we were able to raise in 2020 and deploy that capital.
Jim mentioned that we are a growing company and you need to keep in mind that the lag of return – there's a lag
in the return on that growth. So, if you think about the contributions of, sort of, a solid loan book, it takes time for
that revenue to materialize. Obviously, it increases overtime, pay for the cost of client acquisition, capital
provisioning for CECL, as well as the cost of growing liquidity to fund all of this. This will all increase overtime. The
sub debt expense is also a component of interest expense, and it takes time to deploy that.
So, we've got the economics of a growing bank, as Jim pointed out a minute ago, and some of the expense
structure that we've put in place in 2020 will pay dividends in 2021. So, ROE improvement before ROA and I think
we'd – I'd take you back to Jim's goals for the year in terms of revenue growth, expense growth and what we plan
to do in terms of the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sure. Understood. And then just a clarification question on the 10% to 12% expense growth for the year. Are you
guys assuming that off of, kind of, like $123 million-ish jump right here on 2020, or are there any other
adjustments we should be mindful of?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
No. I think if you just took our annual expenses for 2020, and grew that by low-double-digits, as Jim indicated,
that's what we'd expect for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley Securities. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Morning, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Just on the loan growth guidance here, 15% to 20%, a little bit below kind of what you've done last couple of
years and even relative to this past quarter. Just kind of curious if you can give some color as to how to think
about that. I heard you, Jim, when you said business – the private one should get to 60%. But just kind of curious
as to how you think on the pipeline and growth over the course of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I think – this is Brian. Yeah, I think that 15% to 20% is probably a very safe baseline number, but we would
expect to probably push that more in the 20% to 25% range. But I think another way to think about 15% to 20% is
probably on an average loan growth basis. So, as we look at that more on an – growing that across the year. But
we believe that we have probably the best loan growth opportunities that we've ever had as we approach the next
year or so. So, we would not – we would expect we'd be over that 20% number. Again, I think if we look at 15% to
20% revenue, we'll certainly get part of that from the margin expansion we talked about. Obviously, we'll put some
additional money to work on the investment side and then growing the loans over 20%, support that revenue
growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of just maybe following up on the reserve ratio and credit costs here,
yeah, I hear you guys on economy improving to help drive the provision expense down. Just kind of how do we
think about maybe that reserve ratio heading back towards what we saw pre-COVID in terms of maybe how long
it will take to get back towards those levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So I think we're – yeah, I think we're looking at a very sort of flat economy, I mean, from a reserve perspective, I
think, in 2022 or 2021 as David mentioned, right? So, that's going to be a multi-year process from our perspective.
We're not necessarily in a rush to do any of this. But again, the loans we put on in 2021, again, this – and
probably I'd revert back to your answer from last time, that private bank loans we will continue to look to grow
12

25% to 30%. So out of that number that we gave to you, that 15% to 25% loan growth, significant part of that will
be on the private bank side. And then on the commercial side, the loans that we put on this year we think, yeah,
will be favorable under CECL treatment.
So, we would expect that this is going to be a pretty modest year from a contribution, but a revert. So, we'll start
obviously reducing the percent loans – provision to loans a bit through our growth because that'll probably come
on a bit slower and then – but in terms of actual releases, I think we're looking at a longer period.
I don't know, David, if you wanted to add to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
No, I agree. If you're targeting your comment to releases, I don't think you'll see us release reserves for a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, but from an average annual credit cost, we would expect to continue to outperform relative to peers, for
sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. You want to keep in mind what our historical track record has been with regard to credit, Steve. We haven't
had a single net charge-off in the past three years. And in the past five years, it's been $2.6 million. And then if
you look back to the recession, it was $37 million. So, we have a pretty credible track record in that regard that
the underwriting system that we put in place has really delivered to us, and we continue to have confidence in
that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate all the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.

David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Hey, Russell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted to – hey, guys. So, on Chartwell, a nice finish to the year. I was just wondering if you could share your
revenue expectations for 2021 for that fee vertical and what the drivers would be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. What you're going to see there, clearly, is the fact that their distribution network continues to perform. They
have credible investment performance. Most of the flows that we reflected to you in the presentation came into
our short duration, high yield product, and also the value products that we have in place at the company. So, we
anticipate a very robust year there, based on performance, the quality of the distribution network and the client
base that we've been able to establish both on the retail and the institutional side.
If you look at the retail side of the business, it's now over 20% of the assets and it was immaterial when we
acquired the company in 2014 and you look at the institutional side of the business and it continues to grow pretty
handily that $115 million that I mentioned should be converted over in the next 60 days and coming to this
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Russell, just to put some numbers behind themes that Jim shared with you, Chartwell was able to reduce their
expenses by 12% in 2020. And at the same time, their net income in 2020 was up 15% year-over-year. Their run
rate revenue right now is on pace to be about $36 million for 2021. So, they had a great 2020 and they're set up
for a great 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Jim, David, thank you both for that. And then just for my final question, hoping you could talk a little bit about
trends within your commercial portfolios, both C&I and CRE, and what drivers of growth for 2021 would be there?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Russell. I think if we look at what we were able to do in 2020 and to roll that forward in 2021, we'd
be pretty happy particularly in the second half of that. So, on the C&I side, we would probably continue to see a
significant portion of the growth driven by equipment finance and fund finance and these are where – agile
products, growing industry, growing demand where we can engage pretty quickly and use our expertise and
networks to engage with clients. Certainly, we want to be there to continue to grow our fundamental C&I business
as well. I think it's really going to be around finding when people want to focus on making a transition and when
they're comfortable to do that.

But in terms of our clients, by the way, I mean, again, I think Jim mentioned it in his script, I mean, we've been
inspired and just really impressed with how our commercial clients have managed their businesses as well as
their real estate development. So, I think that there's certainly significant opportunities with our existing portfolio to
grow along with our clients as well as we come out of this. So we're excited by those three, so they're probably
the three primary drivers on the commercial real estate side.
We're still very excited about the opportunities that our key clients have in the geographies and the markets. And
again, that includes sort of all of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and some contiguous states. So as
we work with our known clients or our known prospects, so a pretty exclusive group of people that we work with,
certainly sponsor-driven, they are liquid and they're finding significant opportunities in this environment.
So asset classes or loan types, property types, probably similar to what you're going to see other places. We
continue to focus on industrial, flex, multifamily, and we might see some opportunistic investments for our clients
in other places. But we're fundamentally engaged with them on a fundamentally new business. I mean, the other
good part is we're really committed to keeping the loans that we have from a refinance perspective and continue
to keep that in the portfolio. So, the activity we need to generate in 2021 even though we are seeing it being a
more competitive environment than 2020, we're still optimistic that we can minimize our payoffs and where more
growth falls to the net side. So I think that's where we're going to be able to have strong growth in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
