Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2021
financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the dedication and
strong performance of State Street employees during the past year. These team members remain central to the
continued successful execution of our strategy as we hope to create better outcomes for the world's investors.
Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2021, including higher fee and total revenue generation, successful
execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business
momentum, as well as announcing the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, all of
this would not have been possible without our employees' hard work, skills and commitment.
Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the progress we've made during 2021, with both of our business segments
performing strongly as we've advanced towards achieving our medium term financial targets.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Within the Investment Servicing business, we enhanced – our enhanced core strategy, combined with our
strategic pivot to an enterprise outsource solutions provider across the front, middle and back office, manifested
itself to the stronger business momentum and revenue growth in 2021, which you can see along the top of the
slide.
As we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segment, we achieved record AUC/A
servicing wins of $3.5 trillion in 2021, and continue to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities, underpinned
by our integrated front-to-back Alpha platform. We announced nine additional Alpha wins in 2021, with 10 Alpha
clients now live at year-end. We also continued to enhance our product capabilities in 2021, launching Alpha for
private markets as well as our new State Street Digital division.
At Global Advisors, we executed well against our long-term strategy, which contributed to a number of records for
that business in 2021, including revenues, assets under management and ETF inflows. Importantly, Global
Advisors' full year pre-tax margin expanded by over six percentage points in 2021 to a record 32%, deepening the
value of our investment management franchise to State Street's results. Our Spider business performed
particularly well in 2021, gaining US ETF flow market share, including low cost in active, in addition to the record
inflows I just mentioned.
As I look back at 2021, I am particularly pleased with our client impact, improvement in our sales effectiveness
and heightened focus on client satisfaction, service quality and retention across our businesses, together with a
favorable equity market backdrop, helped to drive a stronger revenue performance. Notably, full year servicing
and management fees each reached our highest level on record in 2021, with total fee revenue increasing by 5%
year-on-year and exceeding $10 billion for the first time.
While we delivered a strong revenue performance in 2021, expense management remained a key focus for us,
with company-wide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately $330 million of gross expense
savings. Because of our strong revenue and sales performance in 2021 and the healthy pipeline in front of us,
these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent, technology and business in the fourth
quarter to drive future growth.
Even with this increased investment, total expenses were well contained relative to revenue growth, helping to
drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide.
Despite record low interest rates, and excluding notable items, we delivered meaningful full year pre-tax margin
expansion, positive fee and total operating leverage and EPS growth in 2021, and we expect to do this again in
2022.
Turning to slide 4, I will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in
more detail. 4Q 2021 EPS increased 28% year-over-year, or 18% excluding notable items. This strong year-over-
year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth, which more than offset interest rate headwinds
on NII, leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance.
We delivered 130 basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items.
Importantly, we again expanded State Street's pre-tax margin, which increased by more than one percentage
point relative to the year ago period to 28% in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items.
The solid business momentum that we saw during 2021 continued into the fourth quarter, which you can see in
the middle of this slide. AUC/A increased to a record $43.7 trillion at quarter end, and new asset servicing wins

amounted to $332 billion for the quarter. AUC/A won but yet to be installed was $2.8 trillion at quarter end, while
Charles River's annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year to $244 million.
At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.1 trillion at quarter end. Management fees increased to
a record $530 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher year-on-year average equity market levels and
record inflows to our ETF franchise.
Turning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide, capital return remains a key part of our medium-term
targets, and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. As you know, we suspended common share
repurchases in Q3 in connection with our intended purchase of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. We
currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year, in line with our
previous expectations.
To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we
demonstrated in 2021. We meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key
metrics, creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our medium-term financial targets.
Looking ahead, I have four core strategic objectives for 2022, which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for
the organization and position the business for future success. First is to continue to grow revenue by executing on
a number of key strategic priorities this year, including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer
underpinned by our Alpha platform build-out, continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities,
particularly private markets, and further strengthening sales in client management capabilities and processes.
Second, the successful integration of BBH Investor Services is a key priority. The proposed acquisition is a
financially compelling use of capital. And once closed, it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the
world's largest custodian, expand and deepen our international reach, further propel our Alpha strategy and add
strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise.
Third, as we did in 2021, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and
efficiency throughout our organization. We are developing and implementing a simplified, scalable, configurable
end-to-end operating model. This more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality, operational
capacity, speed and resilience.
Fourth, we must continue to build an even higher-performing organization. Our performance culture and improved
employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse, engaged and empowered team with the
experience, capabilities and desired behaviors required for future growth.
These four goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our medium-term financial targets. I
have confidence that we will be able to meet our strategic and client goals, while also delivering positive fee and
total operating leverage, and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by
the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021
results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on slide 5. First, we

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
recognized acquisition and restructuring costs, most of which were related to CRD and whose integration is now
complete. Second, we recognized the net repositioning release of $3 million, which consists of occupancy cost of
$29 million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs worth
$32 million as attrition picked up, and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated.
Third, we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by
accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards. The impact of the acceleration
increased expenses by $147 million in this quarter. This change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate
versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods, which will make our pay practice
competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market. Our mix of deferred equity
remains unchanged.
Finally, you'll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a $58 million gain on sale of legacy LIBOR-based
securities previously classified as held to maturity. This sale, and this quarter's higher-than-usual tax benefit,
helped to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration I just mentioned.
Turning to slide 6, I'll begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As you can see on the top
left of the slide, we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to 4Q 2020. 4Q 2021 fee
revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees, management fees and CRD revenues,
only partially offset by lower FX trading services. 4Q expenses were well-managed, delivering positive total
operating leverage, notwithstanding the significant 2021 NII headwind. 4Q pre-tax margin is up more than 1
percentage point year-on-year and ROE is up almost 2 percentage points.
On the right-side of the slide, we show our full year 2021 revenue performance. As Ron highlighted earlier, 2021
was a record year for us for fee revenues. And despite historically low interest rates in 2021, I'm quite pleased
that for the full year, we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than 1 percentage point improvement in
pre-tax margin and EPS growth in the double-digits.
Turning to slide 7, you'll see our Investment Services balance growth remained strong as we saw record AUC/A
at the end of the fourth quarter of $43.7 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 13%, largely driven by higher market
levels, client flows and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A growth was muted as markets were pretty
mixed.
At Global Advisors, AUM at year-end increased 19% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.1
trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels,
coupled with net inflows. Of note, we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost $80 billion.
Our global SPDR ETF business recorded the highest ever quarter driven by strong US flows, pushing total net
ETF inflows to $107 billion for the full year.
Turning to slide 8, you can see another quarter of good business momentum. Fourth quarter servicing fees
increased 6% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, client activity inflows and
positive net new business again. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a
full point of currency translation.
On a sequential basis, I would remind you that while the S&P was up on average, international markets were
down, so markets were relatively neutral. Servicing fees were down 1%, primarily due to client activity and
adjustments and the impact on appreciating US dollar, partially offset by another quarter of positive net new
business.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
AUC/A wins totaled a solid $332 billion in the fourth quarter, which gets us to a record $3.5 trillion new wins
across client segments and regions for the full year, and our pipeline remains strong. At quarter end, AUC/A won
but yet to be installed amounted to $2.8 trillion, with Alpha representing a nice proportion, which reflects the
unique value proposition and our competitive strength as the only front-to-back offering from a single provider.
Turning to slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees reached a record $530 million, up 8% year-on-year and up
1% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pre-tax margin of 34% for fourth quarter. The
year-on-year management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong
ETF inflows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation
and money market fee waivers of $20 million in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter results were largely driven by
a slight uptick in equity market daily averages.
As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong
quarterly momentum and full-year results. We are particularly pleased with the actions that we've previously taken
over the years in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises delivered growth over the course of 2021.
Regarding management fee money market waivers, we currently expect that they will come in at approximately
$5 million less in the first quarter of 2022 based on an anticipated March Fed rate hike, which will be included in
our 2022 outlook.
Turning to slide 10, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. FX trading services was
down 7% year-on-year, reflecting lower FX volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business. On a
sequential basis, FX revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower
volumes.
Moving to securities finance, fourth quarter fees increased 16% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher client
securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down
4% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, fourth quarter software and
processing fees were down 4% year-on-year, and 2% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower market-
related adjustments, partially offset by continued growth in CRD, which I'll turn to next.
Moving to slide 11. I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD
results in the quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Full-year stand-alone revenue growth was 11%
year-on-year, which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the double-digit
range. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and
converted more clients to the cloud. SaaS clients now represent nearly half of our CRD client base. In addition,
we achieved record new bookings of $62 million for full year 2021, with a healthy revenue backlog of $117 million
at quarter end, demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into 2022, supported by the State
Street Alpha value proposition.
Turning to Alpha on the bottom right of the slide. Full-year 2021 was a busy year as we announced nine new
Alpha mandates and nearly doubled the amount of wins we've achieved since inception. At year-end, we have 10
total live Alpha clients. We've also been busy enhancing our Alpha product offering this year. In addition to
launching Alpha for private markets and our acquisition of Mercatus in the third quarter, we also went live with our
Alpha data platform in the fourth quarter, which is our cloud-native platform providing enterprise data
management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily end-to-end
investment processes.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Turning to slide 12. Fourth quarter NII was down 3% year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of a low 2021
interest rates on the investment portfolio yields, partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances, as well
as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio.
Relative to the third quarter, 4Q NII came in 1% lower, primarily as a result of the expected normalization of
premium amortization. As you may recall, third quarter 2021 included an episodic benefit worth about $7 million,
which we previously noted wasn't expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. We do, however, see continued
premium amortization slowing. We, like many of you, are excited about the rise we've seen in long-end rates this
year. However, short rates have been flat so far, and it's really the prospect of Fed action in the March timeframe,
which would have a significant benefit on NII.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average assets increased
4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher deposit levels. We consciously allowed average deposits to float
up this past quarter, which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates.
Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items were up 1% year-on-year as we previously
decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong year-on-year performance and pulled forward some
investments in the business. At the end of the year, however, we also experienced some higher-than-expected
episodic expenses. Medical costs were higher as we saw a ramp-up in year-end claims. We saw some elevated
IT vendor costs, and we realized higher marketing spend associated with GA volumes.
Compared to 4Q 2020, on a line item basis, excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was
up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation and medical costs, partially offset by lower head count and
salaries. Notably, our continued focus on digitization, automation as well as resource discipline have helped us
reduce our head count this year by 2 percentage points even as we onboarded larger deals and processed more
transaction volume.
Information systems and communications were up 11% due to continued investment in our technology
infrastructure and resiliency as well as equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud. Transaction
processing was down 7%, primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs. Occupancy was down 6%,
reflecting the benefits from eliminating another 5,000 seats and achieving 115% occupancy rate and other
expenses were down too.
Overall, we're pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline.
Excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately one percentage point, full year 2021 expenses
would have been flat and in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid single-digits, we meaningfully
expanded our pre-tax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging
interest rate environment.
Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios
followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating
environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of
quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 14.2% increased 0.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, primarily
reflecting an outsized reduction of about $5 billion in RWA related to the impact of FX mark-to-markets and higher
retained earnings.
We expect RWAs to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected
regulatory changes coming in 2022, all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance.

Our Tier 1 leverage decreased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by higher client deposits. And lastly, we
returned a total of $209 million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends.
As previously communicated, we expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target
ranges for the first half of 2022, inclusive of the implementation of SA-CCR and the expected closing of the Brown
Brothers Investor Services acquisition.
Turning to slide 15. You can see a summary of our 4Q 2021 and full-year 2021 results. I've already covered fourth
quarter in detail, so let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for 2022.
In summary, we're pleased with our strong performance this year. Notwithstanding the challenging interest rate
environment, we delivered a 5% increase in total fee revenue for the year, with Servicing and Management fees
reaching our highest levels on record.
Our expenses for the full year remained well controlled, and despite higher revenue-related costs and
investments in our business and people. As a result, even in last year's low rate environment, we delivered
positive operating leverage, and we were able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced
medium-term targets.
And with that, I'll turn to outlook. On slide 16, let me cover our full-year 2022 outlook as well as provide some
thoughts on the first quarter, both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the Brown
Brothers Investments Services.
We continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter, although the timing could fall in the second quarter.
We are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals, some of which have already been secured.
The process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing
the high volume of global M&A activity.
That said, given the current higher equity market step-off and new interest rate forward, we now expect about
25% year-on-year EBIT growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of
just 15% year-on-year EBIT growth in our original acquisition deal modeling.
Now as I usually do, let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro
level, our rate outlook largely aligns to the current forward curve and assumes we see three US rate hikes in
2022, with the first hike occurring in March.
We are also assuming around 5 percentage point to point growth for equity markets in 2022 as well as further
normalize FX market volatility, which influences our trading businesses. As for currency translation, we expect the
US dollar will be stronger for the year, which will be a headwind to revenues, but mostly offset as a benefit to
expenses.
So, beginning with revenue. For the full year, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 3% to 4%, with
Servicing fees growing 2% to 3%; both include about 1 point of currency translation headwind for 2022.
Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year given equity market
expectations and continued business momentum, with Servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and
Management fees expected to be up 8% to 9%.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
For full year NII, depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes, we expect 2022 NII to be up 10% to 12% on
a year-on-year basis. Regarding first quarter of 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year and still
flattish sequentially.
Now turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up just 1.5% to 2%
on a nominal basis in 2022, as we continue to invest in the business and our people, while driving both positive
total and fee operating leverage.
We currently assume that this includes a 1 percentage point benefit to expenses due to the stronger US dollar.
You can also see on the walk that for full year 2022, we expect another year of gross saves of approximately
three to four percentage points, which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas
like Alpha, Digital, Tech Infrastructure and Automation.
Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect year-on-year expense growth to be largely in line with the full year
guide and include, the seasonal compensation expenses, which occur in the first quarter.
All in all, our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating
leverage. Finally, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2022.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning guys. Happy New Year to both of you. So, maybe we can start unpacking some of the
guidance. And I'm sure there's going to be a good amount of follow-ups on the back of that as well.
But maybe just starting with the fee guide, really zoning in on Servicing fees, State Street has obviously made a
considerable amount of improvement in retaining clients and winning new business. So, maybe help us unpack
within the 2% to 3% growth for the year, what sort of contemplated from markets in terms of the benefit of the 5%
that you guys highlighted earlier? So, how much does the market benefit versus the net new business and
pricing? And I'm assuming BlackRock is included in this guidance as well, but how much of a drag in the Servicing
fee revenue you guys expect from loss of the BlackRock mandate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Alex, it's Eric, Happy New Year to you, too. Let me cover fees and then Servicing fees, which I think is where
you're focused. Our guide for total fee revenue is up 3% to 4% for the year. Our guide for Servicing fee is up 2%
to 3%. And obviously, that includes about one percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange. So in effect,
the Servicing fees are up, for example, 3% to 4% in our guide adjusted for currency translation.
If you think about the drivers, we've factored in all the known events both, our growth, our installations, net new
business and so forth. If you want to peel it apart a little more deeply, we start off at a good equity market level,
and we expect some year-on-year growth from equity markets. That's probably worth about two percentage points
of a tailwind to growth. Flows and client activity, which are variable is probably worth another percentage point
and part of our kind of fee structures.
Net new business is – continues to tick up. We expect core net new business to be up 2%, and that obviously
includes all the new onboardings offset by any attrition. So, that's on a net basis. And then obviously, there's just
the usual 2% grind down of pricing. And that kind of gets you to the low end of our range. We think there's some
upside, which is why adjusted for currency, the Servicing fee guide is in the 3% to 4% range. And what it does is it
represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our medium-term targets, which are really in the
4% to 5% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. That's perfect. And just maybe staying on the topic, but looking at the expense side of the P&L. The 1.5%
to 2% growth, I think, is contemplated on, obviously, the fee outlook that you just outlined. If we are in a tougher
equity market backdrop and let's say, you guys don't hit the 2% to 3% Servicing fee growth or the 3% to 4% fee
growth, what are sort of the bookends around the expense growth trajectory that we could see this year? So in
other words, like, in flat equity markets, should we expect you to be below the guide on expenses given there's
maybe more flexibility or kind of the range is the range and the revenue will be more kind of working
independently?

Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Alex, that's a fair question, and you can see that part of the way we create some, I'll call it, insulation for ourselves
as we think about equity markets and where they might go, whether it's up a lot, modestly flat or down is that
we've designed our plans with the view that we should intend to deliver a couple of points of operating leverage
and actually a couple of points of fee operating leverage, right? That couple of points gives us some flexibility to
handle some variability in what happens in actuality in equity markets.
I think – so certainly, we'll move within our range based on what we see. Obviously, if we see a market, an equity
market correction of down 5% or down 10%, we'll do everything we can to come in below our range. And
certainly, we can flex in this business – a full point can be flexed. It's not easy, but it can be flexed. And that would
be the approach that we take. But we're confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today, part of
this – part of what we see is a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets. So, we think this is a good kind of middle of
the fairway plan, but we'll certainly flex it – we – to the extent that we can.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey, good morning. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the BBH. I appreciate the discussion around the
increase in EBIT from rates. How much of that can you speak to their off-balance sheet sweep deposits, maybe
update us on the level of that? And how you think those act at a rising rate environment in terms of the sweep
fees? Is it pretty similar to the spread on deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Jim, it's Eric. The business that Brown Brothers has run on the Investment Services side is performing well. So,
what we've seen is, with the higher equity markets, we've seen their Servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this
coming year. I think the deposits both on balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what we've
seen. And I think we described those as a bit under $10 billion on balance sheet and a bit over $65 billion swept,
and they're coming right around that range, and that's our expectation for 2022. The – both the on and off-balance
sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up. And on-balance sheet betas are similar
to ours, and we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours
and on theirs. And then the off-bound sweeps also have betas. They're not quite as strong as deposits, but they're
in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice, I think, fee growth as we take on that business.

Okay. Great. And then maybe just pivoting to the asset management business. You had record flows, strongest
flows in many years. Can you just describe where the biggest drivers of that growth are coming from? What you're
doing to enhance that growth? And is this more just the environment's great or do you think there's some
sustainability to that inflow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Jim, it's Ron. Let me take that. I think that the growth is reasonably broad-based in the sense that it's firstly from
our investments, and ongoing investments in the ETF business. So, you saw lots of strength in the core SPDR
offerings, which are really instruments of choice for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where
we have invested active ETFs, fixed income, the low-cost ETFs, non-US.
So, we expect to continue to see a good performance there, particularly as we've worked to solidify our position
with institutional investors. Secondly, in the institutional – in the traditional institutional space, the team's done a
lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business. We have a great client roster,
and we've seen some diversification in that business. And finally, we've got a great cash business there. And
obviously, it ebbs and flows as cash does itself, but we'll also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as
the remainder of the fee waivers goes away. So, it's really across the board.

So first, Eric, I just wanted to unpack some of the NII, the assumptions underpinning some of the NII guidance. I
was hoping you can just share some insights in terms of what you're contemplating as the Fed initiates QT in
terms of just deposit flight broadly or deposit runoff and maybe deposit remixing out of noninterest-bearing
deposits. And just, in terms of spot rates, where you're reinvesting today versus the back book yield?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure. Steve, it's Eric. Let me do that in reverse order. I think the front book and the back book are starting to
converge in the investment portfolio, and you'll see that our investment portfolio yields took another small tick
downward this quarter, in fourth quarter. But starting in first quarter, we'll see that relatively flat, and then you'll

see a slow progression upwards. So, we're comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates. And obviously,
the higher the loan rates come in, the better off we'll be.
The NII uptick for this year, and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening. I
think it's just comfortably dependent on the Fed increases. I think we're showing 10% to 12% expectations in NII,
a little more than half of that is off of rising short-term US rates, about a little less than a quarter is off rising non-
US short-term rates and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates. So, we're really geared towards the
front end rates and then that flows through directly to balances.
For deposit balances, we currently expect US and international deposit balances to be flattish, I'd say, this year.
And I think we're all wrestling with what's the pace of the Fed's actions in terms of rising interest rates. When does
that start? And then when do they start with the – with some amount of quantitative tightening? And I think it's just
helpful to bookend this. There's been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening for the last week or two.
Certainly, it will happen.
If you go back to the last cycle, which was just three, four years ago, so not a long time away, quantitative
tightening started two years after the first rate rise and a full year after the second and third and fourth, kind of that
steeper part of the rate rising cycle. And so, I think quantitative tightening, there'll be a bit [indiscernible]
(00:41:42) and this is something to expect in 2023 more than 2022. And will thereby and then have some effect
on deposits.
How much, it's hard to tell. As you know, this cycle, we've controlled some of the uptick in deposits. We had
pushed them off in third quarter, as you recall, let some back in this quarter. We'll certainly see some deposits ebb
downwards in 2023 and 2024 perhaps or potentially just stay flattish because the question is the pace of the
quantitative tightening. And if you recall, last time around, just, I guess, three, four years ago, I think the Fed felt
like it tightened too much, right, and created some disruptions in the short-term money markets. And so – but we
expect some tightening to happen in, say, a year and half from now or thereabouts, we'll see. I think the pace of
the tightening may be more moderate. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see. That's, call it, a 2023 topic. I think 2022
should be fairly straight.

Steven Chubak Q

Thanks for that context, Eric. And just for a follow-up on how you're thinking about capital management. You
spoke about reinitiating the buyback beginning in 2Q. I was hoping if you can give us some context as to like what
level of payout you're planning as we look ahead to 2022, 2023. And just in terms of future changes to the capital
regime, any guidance you can provide on the impact of SA-CCR and preliminary thoughts on the impact of
upcoming changes under a Basel IV regime would be really helpful.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
So, let me take it, kind of, from the near end timeframe to further out. We've – I think we're pretty comfortable with
our capital guidance that we'll be at the low end of our 10% to 11% range for CET1 in the first quarter. That
includes both the SA-CCR being implemented and the consummation of the Brown Brothers acquisition. So, that I
think will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year.
And we're, I think, comfortable with both of those. As we go through the year in the second quarter, we'd certainly
like to start the buyback. We'll see at what pace – the pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact
capital ratios as we hit first quarter. And then second quarter, we'll see how OCI swings either positively or
negatively. And so, I think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in the second quarter and then
proceeding at pace in the third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond.
And then, I think, at that point, we're back trying to – we're not trying, but operating within our guidance that
capital return should be in the 80% plus of earnings. And that puts us, I think, in a way that we continue to return
through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice comfortable way. So anyway, a nice path forward. But first half
of this year, I think low end of our ranges. And then in the second quarter and then third quarter, fourth quarter,
we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level.
The Basel III refinements, Basel IV end game, there are different ways [indiscernible] (00:45:53) out there. It will
certainly come to pass. Clearly, we'll get some benefits on the loan book, though we have a smaller loan book
than others. So, we'll probably get some headwinds from the fundamental review of the trading book, and then
some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges. So my guess is it will be a bit of a headwind. But, like I said
before, it's been all factored into our capital ratio guidance. We generate quite a bit of capital each year. And we
feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our medium-term targets of returning 80% or more of earnings
back to shareholders.

Steven Chubak Q

That's great color, Eric. And just quickly, can you – did you quantify the impact from SACR just so we could start
to reflect that in our models?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. I didn't in the prepared remarks. But the rough amount, we carry typically about $115 billion of RWAs. It was
a little less this quarter. SACR is – will cost us in the first quarter just over $10 billion. And we've got offsetting
actions worth about half of that, about half, so call it around $5 billion. So I think net basis, it's probably worth
about $5 of RWA. But as I said before in my prepared remarks, this has all been factored into our capital
guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters, and we're confirming and affirming that will be within
our ranges in the first half of the year.

Hi, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Eric, can you give us some further color on – you gave us good detail on the servicing fee growth and how you
expect to see that 3% to 4% grow this year with some new inflows, as you pointed out, but also from some equity
improvement in the markets, I think you said about 2 percentage points of that number. When you take the –
when you look at the equity portion, how important is the US markets versus EMEA and the other markets? Can
you kind of give us a flavor? Is it generally geared toward the US markets that drives your growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, it's Eric. It's really a mix. I think maybe almost – if I just think about the ranges, it's a bit under half that's
driven by US markets, closer to probably, I don't know, a third-ish of European markets. And then, Australia and
emerging markets, just because of the, in some cases, the higher fee rates, is also important. That could be worth
20%, 25%.
The other is, remember, we have – part of our book is fixed income assets that we service. And so that's why
equity market tailwinds affect part of our book, but not all of our book in rising rates. We've got the opposite effect
on the fixed income side. What I – just as we – from planning purposes, as we go into the year, though, on a
point-to-point basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year
of 2021, that in and of itself should give us at least 1 point, 1.5 points of servicing fee lift.
And then, what we're talking about is whether the point-to-point growth from December 31, 2020 to December 31
can give us that extra 0.5 point. So I think that's how you get the roughly 2 percentage point tailwind that we
expect. Some of it is, in a way, baked in, assuming markets don't go down, and then a smaller piece is coming
from some modest depreciation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, you discussed it as have your peers about the expectation of rising interest
rates and short-term rates – run rates in 2022. Can you share with us the duration of the fixed income portfolio?
And what rates should we watch carefully that would impact the AOCI, meaning the mark-to-market would be
negative for the portfolio?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. We – the duration of the investment portfolio, we inched down this quarter. You could have seen that in the
NII slide that we had. I think we're at about 2.9 years, so trended down a bit from the last quarter – last couple of
quarters. And right now, we're a little more comfortable. We've been investing in the belly of the curve, kind of the
two to five-year range. I think that 10-year up through 2 percentage points is quite comfortable for us, including
from an OCI management standpoint. I think if you get a good bit above 2 percentage points on the 10-year, you
kind of have a – you got a double effect.
On one hand, you get an OCI hit, which obviously accretes back over time so it's temporary. And on the other
hand, you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters. So I think it's
mixed, but net positive, if we have some sort of spike at the back end. But it would affect just the mechanics of
how we operate quarter-to-quarter on the margin.

Research.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys. You had another good quarter of loan growth here with average loans up 7.5% sequentially.
What were the drivers there? And how sustainable do you think that is into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Rob, it's Eric. Loan growth has been good for us the last, say, couple of years, to be honest. I think we've
comfortably driven loan growth quarter-after-quarter up in the low double-digits on a year-over-year basis. This
quarter, we continue to see good client demand, but we also shifted some – we also added some CLOs in loan
form as we reduced the CLOs and securities form from the investment portfolio. So there was a bit of a shift.
That said, I think, in general, what we're comfortable doing is continue to grow core loans because that's – we
won't always have a shift every quarter. This is more episodic just as we rebalance and think about stress testing
and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints. But we're still comfortable continuing to grow this loan
portfolio in the low double-digit range. It won't happen every quarter. There's a little bit of seasonality, but we
continue to see quite strong demand from our alternative clients and private equity capital call financing.
We see demand in some [ph] parts (54:06) of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in. And the
biggest focus, I'd say, is, as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients, a lot of what we do is work with them

and make sure that's part of a broader relationship because that's where it really is remunerative for us and for

Got it. Thank you. And then, turning to expenses and operating leverage. The outlook implies maybe a 2
percentage point delta between fee growth and expense growth. But that also bakes in plus 5% or 6% from
investments in variable costs. Do you think of that as still an elevated level of investment, and there's some more
operating leverage available longer-term? Or is this kind of the required level of investment going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
It's hard to forecast the future. The amount of investments is partly around what's table stakes in the marketplace
and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings. And clearly, you've seen us invest,
in particular, in Alpha, in the front office, and Alpha that spans into the middle and back office. And we're also
finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements in custody, in
some areas of accounting, which also is attractive segment by segment.
So, it's hard for me to say what's the necessary amount of investments. We think there's a range. We think, last
year, we probably invested a bit less than this, probably instead of 5% to 6%, I'd say there was probably 1.5
points less of investments during 2021. So, I think what you'll see is, you'll see us flex the amount of investments
from one year to the next.
I think what we're conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and
seeing the revenue growth from past investments. And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing the revenue growth
on the past investments that we've made across the franchise, and I think that gives us the confidence to continue
to carefully invest, and, in some cases, accelerate that, but I think in modest ways.
I think the other part of our culture has been to, at the same time as we invest, find productivity and savings. We
think that's an important part of how to run a business, but certainly a business that over time we're digitizing and
automating should come with productivity savings and engineering. And I think the other part of our business
processes – and I think you'd hear this from our senior executives, the more we can drive in productivity saves,
the more we feel comfortable in investing and that's a very – that's a virtuous circle.

What I would just add to that is that it's actually good news that we're seeing opportunities to invest in the
business, because – particularly as we've built out the Alpha platform, which was originally aimed at the asset
management space and the traditional asset managers, we're now starting to roll out Alpha for private markets.
So, it's good that we're seeing the opportunities, but I would underscore Eric's point that, notwithstanding that
goodness, what we're focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity. And we see more
opportunities there. So, we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer. And the fact
that there are investment opportunities is actually a good thing, because it shows that notwithstanding the
narrowness of where we operate, there's plenty of spaces to grow.

I like that. That rhymes. Question, on the deferred comp acceleration, I'm just curious at what level employee are
we talking? And I'm asking because the deferred portion, obviously, you're saying to get practices more
competitive, so that presumes that you were deferring more than peers and that, going forward, you'd have a
higher cash piece going forward. I'm just curious on – it's probably included, obviously, in your expense guide, but

Glenn, just to give you context, the – we've made this change. We had made one change five years back. And I
think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace. And the way the facts that might help a little bit is,
way back when we had immediate cash in the 30% range of compensation for the average employee, the
deferred cash was 40% and the equity, the deferred equity was 30%. That was a place that was completely out of
market.
We fixed about two-thirds of that five years ago, and got to 50% immediate cash, 20% deferred cash and 30%
deferred equity. And now, we're – with this final change, we're going to take that up to – the immediate cash to
60% to 65%, the deferred cash to just 5% to 10%, mostly for the most senior folks, and then the deferred equity
stays at 30%. So, we think we're now in line with the market as part of this change. What does happen is you've
got to crystallize some of these deferrals into the P&L in the current period. And then what that allows us to do is,
going forward, to add to the cash mix. And because we've crystallized the previous deferrals, those don't hit the
P&L in the future, but the new cash will hit the P&L in the future. So this will be neutral to subsequent periods on
the expense line.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. So I mean, this is an ongoing objective of ours, Glenn, and it really is around performance culture. And if
you think about culture, which is a very used and sometimes maligned term, for us, it's about desired behaviors
and, on the flip side, kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors.
So what we're focused on is those desirable behaviors, all related to kind of driving performance. I would argue
that it's even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago, because on top of everything else
that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders, we're now operating – we're now all
operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future.
That puts a burden, new burdens and new requirements on managers, particularly middle managers. So, it's all
about being able to eke out the benefits, which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility
and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things, but at the same time, making sure that we're
continuing to deliver where we are. So we think about performance in terms of – and we think about our culture
and high performance in terms of behaviors.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Operator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to circle back, Eric. I believe – I just wanted to kind of
clarify some of the points you made. I think you talked about BBH and the EBIT growth expected to accelerate
here in 2022 up to 25%. So just to make sure I'm level-setting correctly, you also talked about some strength in
servicing, it's not all NII. That 25%, should we apply that to the $375 million that you provided previously when you
announced the deal? Or did that actual number shift from expectation? And am I using the right baseline? And
then for the other disclosures you provided around the revenue and whatnot, should we – did those shake out in
line with expectations? Or did they work out to be a little better as you alluded to? And how should we think about
that baseline when we think about three quarters of a year here for them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Let me – fair questions, Brennan. It's Eric. We had, as you remember, accurately estimated their 2021
performance to be EBIT of about $375 million. They came in right around that level. So we're comfortable with
that as a base case. And if you recall, we had shown 17% growth from 2020 to 2021 in some of our
documentation as we announced the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition.
From a deal model perspective, at the time, we had expected off of the 2021 base to grow at about 15%. So in
line with the past, part of that was the equity market tailwinds continue to play through, and part of that was just
good business performance they – our Brown Brothers colleagues and Investment Services really drive a nice set
of initiatives each year to drive growth, client activity and so forth.
And what we're finding now is because of the equity market step off and the interest rate environment, we expect
to be roughly at about a 25% EBIT growth from 2021 to 2022. I think a portion of that is on the equity – is on the
servicing fee line. A portion of that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps. Remember that comes through
the fees as well. And then a portion is from on-balance sheet NII. And I don't have the pieces handy, but clearly,
the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors, and that will affect both the on balance
sheet and the swept deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you for that clarification. And then separate issue, for my second question, it looks like there's
a transitional leadership. It seems like Cyrus is retiring in the asset management business. That's been a
business where there's been both speculation and open discussion with you all in the past about strategic
direction and whatnot. What does the transition in leadership present as far as an opportunity to shift strategic
direction? And what can you let us know about your updated thoughts on that business and whether or not a
leadership transition is impacting the direction you want to go? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, I mean as you can maybe see from our results, we've invested in that business over the years and the
investments are paying off. We like the business. It's very complementary to the core servicing business. Having
one of the largest asset managers also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an
R&D laboratory. There's client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds that

we've gotten better and better at leveraging. So we like the business. We intend to stay in the business. Under
Cyrus' leadership, they've done a great job, and the numbers speak for themselves there.
So I wouldn't expect to see a broad strategic change here, certainly not in that direction I just outlined. I mean,
there's always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses. So we'll want to continue to do that.
We've got a very strong talent base there, but this is an attractive business, and one in which we will look inside
and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here. But we have full intention of continuing to run
and grow that business.

Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I appreciate the update on BBH and the EBIT outlook
there. And I guess, as we move closer to that closing date, I was just curious, the change in the EBIT outlook and
the operating environment, does that actually trigger any increase in the total consideration that will need to be
paid? Obviously, the implied valuation would be lower than that announcement. That was just one thought that
crossed my mind.
And then, the follow-up there is, can you just remind us of the unexpected fee synergies specifically, which ones
do you feel confident that you can deliver on sooner after the close versus the one that will take more time to
come through? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, why don't I start that, and I'll turn the synergy part of the question over to Eric? But, no, there's no
contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of
risk management. So no, there's no additional payment that will be due here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
And Mike, it's Eric. Just on the synergies, I think each one of them has a cadence, some of which we did spell out,
I think, on the cost synergies, which is the opportunity, and that's, obviously, come – sometimes will come out of
their base of expenses, sometimes our base of expenses as we put the two together. We had estimated about
40% of our cost synergies would come in year one and then the balance, year two and three. And that's probably
the single largest area.
In terms of the fee synergies, the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly. We can modulate
the amount of swept versus on-balance sheet deposits because we've got the capital resources planned for that.
And I think that's one of the ways that we create real value.
And then the last one on the fee revenue synergies, some of the FX kind of market synergies come in a little more
quickly, right? Because it's about offering a broader set of, say, FX products on which we're more capital-intensive

than simple swaps forwards. That is more about setting up clients and then quickly being there for them. And then
some of the servicing ones take a little longer on part of the sales cycle. But I think there's a good mix.
And obviously, as we work on closing and bringing Brown Brothers in, part of what we've been doing is, as you
expect, kicking the tires on what are the opportunities, how to go to the next round of definition on those so that
we can hit the ground running. And as I've said, when we announced the deal, we'd like to meet or exceed our
targets. And I think the exogenous market tailwinds are part of that, but we'd also like to do it on – through old
fashion execution as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. I appreciate the color there. And maybe just one last one, just a quick clarification. Apologies, if I
missed, but did you quantify that discrete tax benefit? Or is the best way to think about that is just back into it after
considering your typical tax rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
It's – I wrestled Mike with that, because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter.
There was some closing of the previous year tax books. There were some foreign credits that accrue in those
jurisdictions, which then help our GAAP taxes and then there are some foreign credits, but then kind of map back
into the US as a tax payment of the deduction. So there's a series of them. I think the best way to do it is to
probably take – our full year tax rates are typically in the 17% to 19% range. So, you take the midpoint of that,
think about full year this year now with these discrete – which were more elevated than usual in a good way, got
us to closer to 15% tax rate. And I think the difference is probably the – you might call the lumpy piece.
What I do – what I would, though, also note is that, I think tax planning has been the kind of thing that we've done
for many years. We do it. We're always on the bright side of the line, and we do it carefully. We – part of it being
an international bank, we, like other international banks, are able to do some – a modest amount of tax planning.
And so, you'll see it – I think it's – we see that come through the P&L annually, it just tends to be a little lumpy
quarter-to-quarter, and it was a little more lumpy good than usual this particular quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Understood. I appreciate the taxes are always complicated subject. So thanks for the color, Eric.

Sure. Thank you, Mike.

Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to circle back on the deposit opportunity for BBH, just to clarify, I think
you said there's right now $10 billion of deposit [indiscernible] (01:15:44) on the balance sheet of BBH, and then
$55 billion additional in the sweep program. And I think, initially, you were planning to bring about a total of $20

billion inclusive of the deposits on the balance sheet over to State Street to convert. Initially, I think, $14 billion
was the conversion to get you to $20 billion. Maybe if you could just update us on the plan for 2022, if you do
close at quarter end in the first quarter of what you'd like to bring on? And then maybe just talk more strategically
about maybe what kind of portion of that sweep opportunity you might bring on to – on the balance sheet, I guess,
capital permitting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure, Brian, it's Eric. I think you have a good estimate of those just for the broader group. I think we said about $5
billion to $10 billion are on the balance sheet today, about $65 billion are off-balance sheet in swept as we
consummate the acquisition and we're targeting the first quarter [indiscernible] (01:16:57) the end of the first
quarter, we're targeting. We said it could be in the second quarter, this stuff just takes time.
We're looking to bring on the $5 billion to $10 billion that they have on the balance sheet and probably another
$10-ish billion or so that is swept. I think over time, the question is really, at what interest rate levels do we
operate at? If we're at prevailing short rates of 50 basis points, let's say, then on balance sheet deposits aren't
terribly attractive. But when you hit prevailing interest rates of 100 bps or 200 bps, and obviously, you can do this
across different currencies, then you're more inclined to bring more on balance sheet. And so, we think of it as a
range.
I think, we also, though, are quite – we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that works well. It
works well for our clients and the Brown Brothers Investment Services' clients. It works well for a number of global
financial institutions that they have relationships with that they sweep primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate
those deposits. And so, we certainly want to maintain the program for sweeps to want to maintain it in size. But
you can certainly see swings of another $10 billion beyond the initial move potentially. But we're – I think we'll see
when we get there, and part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand, and part of it will be
with the counterparties. And I think there'll be goodness in opportunity here in most circumstances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's great color. And maybe just to segue to second question on deposit beta expectations. I think you
mentioned you thought they might be similar to the last hiking cycle. Just to confirm that, it seemed like they
moved around a bit during the cycle, but kind of ended up around – it looks like a little over 30% of deposit beta
relative to Fed funds rates at the time. I don't know maybe if you can clarify that, and if you think that would be
similar to this cycle? And then, obviously, if you would be treating those BBH deposits in a similar fashion? Or do
they have a different profile?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure, Brian. And it was actually a good opportunity. We see rates rise and the likelihood of the Fed funds. We did
get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw from a deposit beta standpoint, back in
2015, 2016, 2017. I do expect the Brown Brothers deposits behave similarly to ours. They are primarily with asset
managers. They are currency by currency, similar to ours.
But if you go back, and I think we were good about disclosing our quarter-on-quarter interest-bearing deposit
betas and usually, you have to do it by currency, right? So because of how the betas play through. But in the first
rate – the first one or two rate hikes, we saw and expect again to see deposit betas in, call it, 10% range, maybe

10% to 15% range, but it's quite low. When you get to the third, fourth or fifth hike, you're in the 30% range, plus
or minus some, as you leg into the rate cycle. And it's really when you get in the past there in the fifth, sixth,
seventh hike, where you're likely to get closer to 50% interest bearing deposit betas.
Now, I'd like to get there. We'd be pleased with 50% if we get there with that level of prevailing rates. But there's –
I think there's a good opportunity here because, in truth, we've been quite limited in our ability to earn NII that
covers our cost of capital. And so a lot of this is just catch up to a level that are more in line with the long-term
averages.
