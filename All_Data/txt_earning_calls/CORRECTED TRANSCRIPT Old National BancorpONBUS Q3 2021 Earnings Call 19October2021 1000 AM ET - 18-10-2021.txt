Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning. Starting on slide 4, we are pleased to share our third quarter results and an update on our
partnership with First Midwest Bank. I would categorize this quarter's result as right on plan. Earnings per share
were $0.43, and net income was almost $72 million. During the quarter commercial loans, excluding PPP loans
grew at a strong 7.4% on an annualized basis with $1 billion in new production.
We also ended the quarter with a robust $2.7 billion commercial pipeline. Core deposits grew nicely by $327
million during the quarter. Our net interest margin was stable. Capital markets and wealth management revenue
were strong, and mortgage revenue rebounded from last quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Expenses were well managed and down slightly, primarily due to one-time benefits from incentive in real estate
tax accruals. Credit quality metrics remain benign with another quarter of net recoveries. Adjusted ROATCE was
a strong 15.16% and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.4%.
During the quarter, we worked hard with our clients on the PPP forgiveness process. 95% of Round 1 loans have
been forgiven by the SBA and we already have 51% of Round 2 loans through the forgiveness process.
Remaining fees totaled $14 million. Most of our reported credit quality metrics improved during the quarter. We
have reduced our reserves consistent with our modeling as a result of the improving economic conditions. We still
have approximately 32% of reserves supported by qualitative adjustments given the long-term impacts from the
pandemic, expectations for higher inflation, persistent labor supply and supply chain challenges. As we gain
additional clarity around these issues, we may develop more confidence in moving our reserve closer to day one
CECL levels.
A quick update on hiring. We continue to add significant talent during the quarter, especially on our wealth
management team. This was highlighted by three key individuals that joined our wealth team from the former
Wells' Abbot Downing Group, including Jim Steiner, who started Abbot Downing and who will now assume the
role of our Chief Investment Officer. The team will help expand our high net worth and institutional services. They
opened the Scottsdale, Arizona wealth management office to better serve the growing number of clients in that
area.
We also hired two new commercial relationship managers in St. Louis to build upon our recent success in that
market. Our talent pipeline remains strong, and we will continue to hire talented team members.
Moving to slide 5, which contains a quick refresher on some of our accomplishments and next steps with our
merger with First Midwest. Both companies have tremendous integration history and experience. And as a result,
our work is going well. We have precision and communicated most clients' segment and support areas,
organizational structures and leadership. We've also settled on our core processing system along with the most of
the supporting applications. We remain on track for a second quarter 2022 system conversion.
You probably saw First Midwest earnings this morning, the results for the quarter were strong and consistent with
expectations. We also received 99% support from our Special Shareholder Meeting and First Midwest
shareholders provided a similar level of support. We've also received OCC approval. Our application with Federal
Reserve remains pending with the board in Washington, DC, along with the merger applications of many other
bank holding companies. We stand ready to close quickly once we received final Fed approval.
You may have seen that we were sued by the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana, a non-profit advocacy
organization with a history of filing lawsuits alleging lending discrimination. We strongly and categorically deny the
claims in this lawsuit regarding certain of our lending practices. Old National is committed to engaging in fair and
equal lending practices. A testament to this is that we have been named one of the world's most ethical
companies for the past decade. As is customary for us and many public companies, I am unable to comment
further on this pending litigation.
Lastly, despite potential distractions from the lingering pandemic-related issues and our transformational merger,
we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities. And I think our results illustrate the success
of those efforts.
I will now turn the call over to Brendon.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Brendon B. Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 6, our GAAP earnings per share and our adjusted earnings per share were both
$0.43. Adjusted earnings exclude $1.4 million in early merger-related charges, which were largely offset by $1.2
million in debt securities gains.
Slide 7 shows the trend in commercial loans and the related commercial pipeline and production trends, all
excluding the impact of PPP loans. Q3 represents our fifth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth and over
that year, commercial outstandings have grown 11%. Our strong commercial production of $1 billion was once
again led by our Louisville and Minnesota markets with all other regions posting quarter-over-quarter growth.
Our balance sheet production was also well balanced by product with a 60/40 split between CRE and C&I
respectively. Commercial activity remained strong throughout the quarter and we were heading into Q4 with a
very healthy $2.7 billion pipeline with almost $800 million in the accepted category.
Turning briefly to pricing. New money yields on commercial loans increased from prior quarter, which
meaningfully narrowed the gap between new production and portfolio yields. The investment portfolio increased
$263 million this quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth. We continue to put much of our
excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio with new money yields of 1.62% and a portfolio duration well
within five years.
Moving to slide 8. Both period end and average deposit balances increased nicely from Q2 levels with most of the
growth coming from business clients in the non-interest-bearing demand category. Total cost of deposits for the
quarter was unchanged at 6 basis points, while total interest-bearing liabilities declined 1 basis point from Q2.
Next on slide 9, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased $1.7
million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income increased $1.3 million, which is the
third consecutive quarter we have outperformed our stated objective of holding NII stable through earning asset
growth. Net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 2.92% from prior quarter and core margin, excluding
accretion in PPP, declined just 2 basis points to 2.7%.
Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Adjusted noninterest income of $53 million in Q3 was $2
million higher than the second quarter. Our wealth line of business continues to be a bright spot and is on pace for
a record year. Our capital markets business had another strong quarter and mortgage revenues rebounded nicely
following the pipeline valuation decrease in Q2. While mortgage production was down slightly in the quarter, an
increase in the size of the pipeline and stabilizing value resulted in a $5.4 million increase in revenue. This
increase was partially offset by a $2 million decrease in gain-on-sale income as margins continued to normalize.
Next, slide 11 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusting for merger charges and tax credit
amortization, noninterest expense was $180 million. The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by an
accrual adjustment to incentives as well as the reduction in real estate taxes. Both of these items are not
expected to recur.
Turning to PPP loans on slide 12, you will see a roll forward of those balances which stood at $355 million at
quarter-end. We continue to assist clients for forgiveness and approximately 95% of Round 1 and 51% of Round
2 loans are now formally through the SBA forgiveness process. Unamortized fees on the remaining loans totaled
$40 million. We anticipate half of the remaining loans will be forgiven and the related fees recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2021.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Slide 13 shows our credit trends. The quarter proved to be another good one from a credit performance
perspective. 30-plus delinquencies ticked up 1 basis point but remained at a new cycle low of 10 basis points.
With respect to charge-offs, we were fortunate again this quarter to be able to post a net recovery, mostly due to
the resolution and full recovery of a previously written down senior living credit. The non-performing loans to total
loan ratio was once again hit a new cycle low at 94 basis points. While this metric remains higher than peers, the
net charge-offs to NPL ratio is significantly better than peers. We believe our approach to identifying troubled
credits early and our patient approach to work out results in better outcomes for our clients and ultimately lower
costs for the bank.
On slide 14, you will see the details of our third quarter allowance, which stands at $108 million, a decline of $1.5
million from Q2. The improving economic outlook and the positive trends in credit quality support a modestly lower
reserve level. And while our outlook on credit remains optimistic, we recognize the economy has not fully
recovered and it made the decision to maintain our higher level of qualitative reserves which stood at $35 million
at quarter-end. As a reminder, we also continue to carry $38 million in unamortized marks from our acquired
portfolios.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We are very pleased with the fundamental results of
the quarter, strong commercial loan growth led higher core net interest income despite interest rate headwinds.
Our fee-based businesses led by wealth, mortgage and capital markets continue to perform well and in line with
expectations. Expenses remained well-controlled and our strong credit quality continues to keep credit costs low.
Slide 15 includes thoughts on our outlook for 2021. We ended the quarter with a healthy $2.7 billion commercial
pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth. This historically low interest rate environment will
continue to put pressure on net interest income, which should be mitigated through continued earning asset
growth. The PPP loan forgiveness process continued for our clients. We expect the run off of approximately half
of the Round 2 balances to occur in the fourth quarter with the recognition of the related unamortized fees to
occur at that time. We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well.
We were encouraged by the momentum in our wealth business and the strong commercial activity should help
maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business. Mortgage revenue should follow industry
trends and be seasonally lower in the fourth quarter. Our other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near
term. We would expect to see a $3 million increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter, given the
nonrecurring items impacting our third quarter performance.
Lastly, a brief update on taxes. We continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we
work through the last of the remaining one-year historical tax credit commitments. In total, we're expecting
approximately $6 million in tax credit amortization for the year, the corresponding full-year effective tax rate of
approximately 22%.
With that, we are happy to answer any questions that you may have, and we do have the full team here, including
Jim Sandgren, Daryl Moore and John Moran.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger with Hovde
Group. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Good morning. I just wanted to take a moment, let's assume that the deal closes in the fourth quarter, which it
probably will. So, there's going to be a lot of noise in integration over the next, so let's call it, six months. So, are
there any areas in which you feel like there's a low-hanging fruit or opportunity to grow loans outside of Chicago? I
know that the Minnesota market was an area of pretty healthy growth in that playbook, post those two deals a
couple of years ago, it seems to be chugging right along. So, I was just kind of curious if you could talk about
some of the opportunities that you see that present themselves right away and kind of what you are focusing on
that two- to three-year goal, either footprint-wide or Chicago itself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Ben, this is Jim Sandgren. Yeah, you're exactly right. Minnesota continues to be a bright spot and we see
that as opportunity to grow in the future. Louisville, Kentucky continues to be really good for us, Indianapolis and
some of those markets. I know Jim talked a little bit about St. Louis, which is a newer market for us, which has
seen some nice growth. And then obviously, with our partnership with First Midwest, I mean, we see big upside
when we get together with them in the Chicago area, bigger balance sheet. So, looking forward to really grow
throughout the footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think, Ben, one of the things that attract us from First Midwest is they have spent more time and they're
ahead of the game in terms of building out some niche verticals. I think those niche verticals help us. We can
export those across our footprint and maybe give us new opportunities that we weren't looking at today. And I
think we can continue to use that bigger balance sheet across the entire footprint to create new opportunities for
us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the noninterest income, it seems like everything was moving in the
right direction. If you look at it from the momentum perspective, mortgage rebounded, wealth continues to be

strong. I was curious is there any areas in which you are kind of doubling down the reinvestment? I know that
there are some recent hires in wealth management, capital markets continues to perform well, is there any areas
in which it's potentially punching above its weight and we could see some reversion to the mean? Or is everything
kind of operating as is and we should expect similar results for the next year or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, long-term, we continue to believe wealth management as a source for us as well as the Treasury
management business, coupled with a strong commercial business, which means capital markets as well. I think
those are the three areas that we continue to believe. Mortgage will just be cyclical and it'll just drive along with
everybody else's mortgage business. But those three areas in particular and we really haven't seen the benefits of
our new hires in that wealth management business yet. We're carrying the cost for those new hires. And it's not
only the three new hires we just talked about but we've been pretty consistently hiring in that area. And so long-
term, we believe we're going to drive higher than our trend line kind of growth in those areas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sorry, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Jim, Jim, Jim, I'll just add to the list of ways I've disappointed people, so apologies. Well, no, I appreciate you
taking the question. Just, as we sort of look at this, the strong loan growth you guys have been generating, just
curious if you could maybe make a comment or two about what your commercial lenders are seeing in terms of
things like pricing and structure and how you guys are responding to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure. Yeah. Scott, this is Jim again. It's really competitive out there. But the good news that we've talked on a
number of the last few quarterly calls is that we've been out calling and working with our customers and prospects
and building really strong relationships.

So I will tell you credit structure is getting a little crazy. So we continue to stay disciplined there. Pricing, I think
we're doing a good job meeting our pricing hurdles quarter-over-quarter. So, it's tough right now, there's no doubt
about it. But again I think because of the strong relationships we've had and the fact that we've been out calling
throughout the pandemic and as we came through it, I feel like that's how it kind of support the growth. And I think
we're set up on the fourth quarter with a really nice pipeline and a nice accepted portion of that pipeline as well.
So, pretty encouraged.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
And, Scott you know this well, I mean, we're glad, we give up a few points of growth to stick to our discipline
around pricing and structure. So, we're going to play a long game here to make sure we stay true to our history
and roots.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay, thank you. And then, just switching gears a little. Hiring talent away from some of your competitors,
that's been a big part of the story over the last couple of years. Just was curious, Jim, if you can maybe add some
comments about, so what you're seeing in terms of cost to attract new talent and if you could speak to sort of the
notion of wage inflation overall within the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. It's a good question. We're certainly not immune to wage inflation at all levels. And we intentionally raised
our minimums a year ago. And so, a lot of that cost is built into our current run rates. And clearly, going out and
attracting high caliber talent away is more expensive than kind of the average price we pay today.
But we think, again, these are long-term investments that we believe are going to pay high dividends. And so,
we're going to make those investments and just be really thoughtful and deliberate about it. And we have got a
great story to tell. And that story resonates so well with so many people today where they can see themselves
being successful in our organization and being able to take care of the clients and really do their best to work. And
so, we keep telling that story. The price that we have to pay is not unreasonable. And we think it's good for the
long-term health of our company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. All right. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.

Good morning, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Jim, maybe start with a question for you. You've been involved in a lot of M&A
transactions with your time at Old National Bank. Could you just talk about just the level of discussions with
regulators. How in-depth are they as it relates to getting First Midwest closed, just given the size and the
structure. And essentially what I'm getting at is maybe a soft way of asking what is the risk that the MOE gets
postponed given changes in the regulatory landscape?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
It's really hard to tell, Terry. There is no outstanding questions we have with any regulatory agencies, and in
particular the Fed. Obviously, we have OCC approval. And I think like many other bank holding companies, we're
in the queue and we're just waiting for that approval process. We think we've answered any questions they have
for us and really don't have any other feedback. And they're not waiting on any new information from us. So, we're
just going to continue to be patient and thoughtful.
I think the most important point though is, we continue to work on the integration efforts, which are really
scheduled to happen in the second quarter. So, none of that work stops. We continue to build relationships with
each other. We continue to do strategic planning with each other. So, none of that really stops, we just keep
moving forward and we'll wait for – be patient and wait for the final regulatory approval. And then, as soon as we
get that, we'll close shortly thereafter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Appreciate that. And then, as a follow-up, you used to provide average loan size within the commercial portfolio.
I'm just wondering has that changed following the ONB way and industry verticals, and are you competing now
kind of upmarket for larger deals that's contributing to some of the – at least the dollar growth that we're seeing in
the commercial portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I'll give some high-level commentary and I'll let Jim get into the details. But it's certainly on average higher –
just as we entered larger metropolitan markets, most notably when we entered Wisconsin and Minneapolis
specifically, I think we've just seen that trend to move higher. Even having said that, I still think it's pretty granular
on average. And today, Jim, we're running, what was the average recently here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, for C&I, we're at about $300,000 from a portfolio perspective, and commercial real estate about, a little over
$900,000, so to your point, it's still very granular.

Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Jim, I think I want to start with loan growth. Typically, when MOEs get
announced, there's a little bit of market apprehension about pro forma growth rate. You guys had solid growth,
First Midwest had a little bit of growth this quarter. How are you thinking about the pro forma profile of the
company, especially with the economy recovering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think both organizations are going up every day, go out, talk to its clients, service communities, right? And loan
growth will be somewhat dependent on kind of the status of the economy, right? But I think the loan growth that
we've been putting up and producing is the kind of loan growth we ought to be able to put up and produce in a
normal kind of economy or even slightly warm economy that we have today, right? So while we haven't given any
specific guidance, I think what you see is what we should continue to produce. We do think there, again, there's
upside relative to the total balance sheet, and our whole limits will potentially increase in the future plus leveraging
those industry verticals. So, I think, there's great opportunities for us to continue to grow the loan portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then on the deposit growth, you and some of your peers, I think have spoken about just the surprise
factor of the deposit, saying on balance sheet and continuing to come in. With that confidence, can you speak to
kind of the pace of investments – securities investments you might make? You've grown the bond book a little bit
in last couple of quarters, just trying to see an outlook for that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris. We continue to put the excess cash to work. We're actually sitting on a little more cash this quarter
than last quarter and we'll be thoughtful as we put that to work given the outlook on the rates. But our bias is to
put more money to work than us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then maybe if I could sneak one in on once you close the deal, you guys have a ton of capital, maybe
updated thoughts on returning capital through buybacks?
