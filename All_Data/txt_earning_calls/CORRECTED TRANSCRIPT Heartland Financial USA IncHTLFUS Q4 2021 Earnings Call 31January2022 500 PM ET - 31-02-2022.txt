Q4 2021 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2022
Thank you, Towanda, and good afternoon. Welcome to HTLF's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We
appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance for the fourth quarter of 2021 and
for the year.
Now, for the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the year and the fourth quarter. I'll then turn the call
over to HTLF's President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance; and Bryan McKeag, our
EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around HTLF's results. Also joining us today is Nathan Jones, our EVP
and Chief Credit Officer, who will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Now, onto the financial highlights for 2021. So, I'm very pleased to report that we had an excellent year despite
the headwinds we faced. Net income available to common shareholders for the year was a new record high of
$211.9 million; and for the quarter $47.6 million. Earnings per diluted common share for the year was a new
record high of $5. That's a whopping 40% increase over 2020. For the quarter, earnings per diluted common
share was $1.12.
Total assets ended the year at $19.3 billion and annualized return on average assets for the year was 1.19%; and
for the quarter 1.03%. Annualized return on average tangible common equity for the year was 15.59%; and for the
quarter 13.47%. The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis non-GAAP was 3.33% for the year and
3.12% for the quarter. Our efficiency ratio fully tax-equivalent non-GAAP for the year was 59.48%. Bruce and
Bryan will share more details on these items in their comments.
Our book value and tangible book value per common share continued to increase, ending the year at $49 and
$34.59 respectively. That's a 5% and 7% increase over the year-end 2020 respectively. Our tangible common
equity ratio non-GAAP ended the year at 7.84%.
With regard to our M&A strategy, we continue to prioritize both in-market and larger transactions to build scale in
our growth markets. We have a deep pipeline of attractive prospects and a number of active discussions are
taking place. Well, at this month's meeting, HTLF's board of directors approved a $0.27 per common share
dividend payable February 25, 2022, to shareholders of record on February 11, 2022. The board also approved a
preferred dividend of $175, payable on April 15, 2022, to shareholders of record on March 31, 2022.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, HTLF's President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the company's
operating performance. Bruce?

Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon, everyone. HTLF had tremendous success and growth in 2021. I'm pleased to
share with you our solid results from the fourth quarter and the year as a whole. We continue to make significant
investments in talent and technology for our lending teams, which are already delivering results with strong loan
growth and excellent credit quality.
In 2021, we delivered record net income available to common shareholders of $211.9 million. For the quarter, net
income available to common shareholders was $47.6 million. Total assets grew to a record $19.3 billion, up $1.4
billion or 8% from a year ago. Assets increased $278 million from the linked quarter. Asset growth was driven by
strong momentum in commercial and consumer loans, and we continued to see significant growth in deposits and
service fees.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2022
Let's start with loan growth highlights. In the fourth quarter, loans grew $309 million across our portfolios
excluding PPP, an increase of 3% from the linked quarter, again exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $200
million. We saw continued strength across our commercial loan portfolios. From the linked quarter, commercial
and industrial increased $106 million or 4%, owner occupied real estate increased $105 million or 5%, non-owner
occupied real estate was flat, construction increased $42 million or 5%, and our ag portfolio increased $69 million
or 10%. We added 296 new commercial relationships during the quarter, representing $346 million in funded
loans and $69 million of new deposits.
The growth in our ag portfolio demonstrates how we are executing our talent acquisition strategy. The addition of
our food and agribusiness division in California has strategically added capabilities and expertise to service
agribusiness customers in the Central Valley and complements our other HTLF specialized industries teams
across our footprint. In 2021, we also extended our reach in several high-growth markets in the Midwest. We
opened offices in St. Paul, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. And in the fourth quarter, we opened two offices in the
western suburbs of Chicago. In total, we added 15 commercial bankers at these locations.
Our commercial pipeline is currently 15% higher since the end of the third quarter, and we expect to grow
commercial loans by $200 million to $250 million in the first quarter. We are winding down our PPP operations. At
year-end, we have fewer than 500 customers remaining to complete the forgiveness process. Over the lifetime of
PPP, we processed nearly 8,000 loans, totaling nearly $1.6 billion.
As we start 2022, some headwinds remain and customers are managing challenges from COVID, supply chain
disruptions, workforce shortages and wage pressures, and inflation. In our consumer loan portfolio, we saw
growth of $7 million or 1.7% from the linked quarter. Residential mortgage decreased $11 million or 1.3% from the
linked quarter, reflecting declining refinancing activity. We delivered another solid quarter of deposit growth. Non-
time deposits totaled $15.4 billion at quarter end, an increase of $439 million or 3% during the quarter.
For the year, non-time deposits increased $1.7 billion or 12%. We saw total deposit growth for the 11th
consecutive quarter with heavier deposit activity in December. Total deposits were a record $16.4 billion, an
increase of $395 million from the linked quarter, a $1.4 billion or 9.6% from a year ago. Our already exceptional
deposit mix improved even further. 94% of deposits are in non-time accounts. 40% of deposits are in non-interest-
bearing accounts. Our deposit pricing strategy continues to serve us well. For the year, total deposit cost
decreased to 9 basis points from 25 basis points a year ago.
Turning to key credit metrics, our disciplined credit approach has delivered excellent credit quality across our
portfolios. Non-performing loans represented 70 basis points of total loans at the end of the fourth quarter, a
decrease of 14 basis points from the linked quarter. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets
declined to 37 basis points from 46 basis points in the linked quarter. Other real estate decreased to $1.9 million
from $4.7 million in the linked quarter. Delinquency ratio decreased to 7 basis points from 12 basis points in the
linked quarter. Non-pass-rated loans decreased to 7.4%, a decrease of 1.7% for the quarter. Lastly, in the fourth
quarter, we reported a net charge-off position of just over $600,000 or 3 basis points of average loans.
During 2021, we accelerated several of our strategic investments and initiatives to improve the customer
experience. Specifically, we enhanced commercial online account analytics, document management, and form
availability. We completed improvements for customer service agents to access real-time transaction and account
data. This increased first call resolution and improved customer service operational efficiency. We improved loan
document handling and improved loan administration processing time by up to 10%.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2022
We continue to optimize our branch network. In 2021, we closed, consolidated and sold 12 branches or 8% of our
network. In 2022, we plan to close or sell 13 more branches or another 10%. We had elevated expenses in the
fourth quarter as we began executing the consolidation of our separate bank charters into a single charter to drive
long-term efficiency, improve agility, reduce expenses and enhance scalability. Bryan will provide more details on
expenses in his comments. We intend to charter HTLF Bank in Colorado, subject to regulatory approval. We plan
to consolidate our 11 member banks onto this charter over the next year and a half with Citywide Banks being the
first in mid-2022.
As I've previously said, our 11 banks will maintain their brands, local leadership, and local decision-making. HTLF
will maintain its strong and sizeable presence in Dubuque, Iowa. Current HTLF operational and administrative
functions will continue to be largely staffed and run from Dubuque. We expect charter consolidation to be
complete by late 2023.
As I look back on 2021, it's been a year of tremendous growth and accomplishment across HTLF. We are
executing on our growth strategy by investing in talent, expanding our capabilities, extending our footprint into
high growth markets and implementing new technologies. We added HTLF's first Chief Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion Officer to lead our DEI efforts and reinforce our company values. And we refreshed our branding to
better reflect the company we are today and reinforce the strength, insight, and growth we bring to our
employees, customers, communities, and investors. Together, we are HTLF.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing our earnings release, which details another
solid quarter for HTLF with earnings per share reported at $1.12, loan growth of $309 million excluding PPP,
significantly improved credit metrics and continued deposit growth of $395 million. There were several significant
items that impacted the quarter including a $3.1 million decline in income on PPP loans as PPP forgiveness
slowed in Q4.
A spike in mortgage prepayment speeds in the fourth quarter caused premium amortizations on our MBS portfolio
to accelerate, reducing income by approximately $1.9 million this quarter. Restructuring charges of $1.9 million
were recorded relating to the commencement of the charter consolidation project, and write-downs totaling
$424,000 were booked related to branch facilities identified to be consolidated or downsized in 2022. Some of
these items lowered EPS by $0.13 per share.
Before we go into more detail, I would remind everybody that you can find additional information on the quarter in
the fourth quarter investor presentation which is available in the IR section of Heartland's website. I'll start my
comments with the provision for loan losses, which was a $5.3 million benefit this quarter as underlying credit
trends continue to improve, highlighted by loan upgrades exceeding downgrades again this quarter, non-
performing loans falling $13.3 million, loan delinquencies declining again to a new record low to 7 basis points of
total loans, and net charge-offs of only $637,000. The economic outlook factors used to develop the allowance
were largely unchanged from last quarter and still retain a measured level of caution and uncertainty that
management deems appropriate for lingering economic headwinds that are yet to be resolved.
So, at quarter-end, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for
credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments, stood at $125.6 million or 1.26% of total loans. When the PPP

loan balances are excluded, the total allowance stands at 1.29% compared to 1.39% at September 30, 2021. In
addition, at quarter-end, unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet stood at $18.5 million or 19
basis points of total loans excluding PPP.
Moving on to other balance sheet items, investments grew $79 million this quarter and comprised 40% of assets
with a tax equivalent yield of 1.94%, a duration of just over five years and generate about $75 million of average
monthly cash flow. Borrowings decreased $134 million to end the quarter at $504 million or just 2.61% of assets.
Tangible common equity ratio decreased 5 basis points to 7.84% at quarter-end and reflects a 14 basis points
decline due to the decrease in market value of investments, another 12 basis point decline due to the significant
balance sheet growth this quarter. These are partially offset by a 21 basis point increase from retained earnings.
Heartland's regulatory capital ratios also remain strong with Common Equity Tier 1 at just over 11.5% and total
risk based at just under 16%. So, the balance sheet continues to be very strong and well positioned.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $137.2 million this quarter, which was $5.3 million
lower than the prior quarter. Three main drivers of the reduction were a $3.1 million decline in PPP interest and
fees recognized this quarter to $8.1 million from $11.2 million in the last quarter. We exited the quarter with $6.5
million of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on our books. Second, accretion of purchased loan valuation
discounts declined $900,000 this quarter to $2.4 million. As previously noted, we have $18.5 million of
unamortized purchase accounting discounts remaining on our books at year-end. And third, due to the spike in
mortgage prepayment speeds in the fourth quarter, premium amortizations on our MBS portfolio were accelerated
by approximately $1.9 million this quarter. Just as an aside, with the rise in interest rates since year-end,
prepayment speeds have already come back down to levels that should result in premium amortizations
normalizing back to pre-fourth quarter levels.
In total, these three drivers resulted in a $5.9 million decrease in net interest income. Excluding these
components, net interest income would have been $600,000 higher than last quarter. The net interest margin on a
tax-equivalent basis this quarter was 3.12% that's down 22 basis points compared to last quarter. Largely due to
the three items I just mentioned, investment yields declined 23 basis points, loan yields fell 16 basis points while
net interest cost remained unchanged. This quarter, the net interest margin improved 5 basis points of purchase
accounting accretion, which was down 3 basis points from the prior quarter.
Shifting to non-interest expense, non-interest expenses totaled $115.4 million this quarter, up $4.8 million from
last quarter. Excluding restructuring, tax credit costs, and asset gains and losses, core expenses increased $3
million to $111 million compared to $108 million last quarter. The increase is primarily attributed to a $2.3 million
increase in salary and benefits costs that were related to completing the build-out of our food and agribusiness
division, continuing wage inflation pressure, and higher temporary worker costs related to several in-flight IT
projects that we have been pushing to get completed before we began consolidating charters in mid-2022.
Looking ahead to 2022, we believe HTLF will continue to deliver strong results, highlighted by loan pipelines that
remain strong, leading to expected loan growth except PPP in the 2% to 3% range per quarter as the economy
normalizes and our new agribusiness finance group ramps up. Non-time deposit growth is likely to slow into the
1% range per quarter. Assuming no Fed rate changes, net interest income, excluding PPP fees, is projected to
grow mid-single digits on a percentage basis year-over-year as earning assets grow and mix improves.
We estimate that two Fed 25 basis point rate hikes in the first half of 2022 would increase net interest income
approximately $16 million in 2022 due to our asset-sensitive balance sheet and assuming much lower than
normal deposit betas. The 2023 full-year impact of these raises would be an additional $11 million over the 2022
increase. Provision for credit losses are expected to remain low for the next quarter or two and then begin to

normalize with continued loan growth and low net charge-off levels as the economy stabilizes and COVID and
supply chain issues subside.
Non-interest income, excluding investment gains or losses, in total is expected to be flat next quarter at about $31
million to $32 million. We expect year-over-year lift in core non-interest income in the 10% range next year.
However, higher interest rates would likely drive mortgage and trust revenues lower. This also assumes no
change to consumer NSF or OD fees which were currently being monitored and assessed.
Core expenses are expected to return back towards Q3 levels or in the $108 million range next quarter. We are
working to manage core expenses to minimal increases year-over-year in 2022 by rationalizing branches, slowing
IT and other spending, and we should begin to realize some costs as we concentrate on charter consolidation –
some cost saves as we concentrate on charter consolidation. However, persistent inflationary pressures,
particularly wage inflation, could be a difficult headwind.
The remaining charter consolidation restructuring costs are estimated at $17 million to $18 million and will be
incurred over the next two years. The consolidation will reduce run rate costs, create operating leverage for future
growth, and presents some treasury revenue opportunities. These benefits will layer in over the next two years,
and we are confident that in total they will reach $20 million on an annualized basis when the consolidations are
completed in late 2023. And finally, we believe a core tax rate in the 22% to 23% range excluding any new tax
credits is a reasonable full-year rate.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a Q&A – question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.

Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
On the spread income, I suppose that I note that headwinds that you'd discussed I was thinking maybe you might
have a better quarter given the loan growth. Was that potentially – was the growth – was that pretty steady
throughout the quarter? Was that pretty back-end loaded in terms of tie-in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. It was in the back half of the quarter. I think if you look at the average loans for the quarter and some of our
tables compared to where we ended the quarter on a period-end basis, we were higher – quite a bit higher at the
end of the quarter. So, yeah, it was back loaded.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. And then you just had one-off on the charter consolidation Colorado, the selection of that or kind of
how's the charter? Is that kind of central to the geography business friendly state? Any kind of ideas of why that
was selected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, I'll take that one. This is Bruce. Several factors went into it. One of them was that Colorado does have
experience with multistate banking operations, so that that was one of the benefits. They also have experience
handling charters of our size not only today, but in a future state. It is centrally located for all of our brands.
Clearly, it emphasizes our growing presence in the West and the Southwest, and Colorado has very favorable
GDP growth. So, there were a lot of factors that went into it.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2022
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. And a last one on the costs associated with the benefits of the consolidation. I guess it's a two-year
process, that $17 million to $18 million in costs. Is there a point where maybe the end of 2022 you start to – it's
kind of a wash in terms of the saves versus the upfront expenses or just kind of looking for the timing of both
expenses, is that front-end loaded in that savings sort of in the second half? If you could comment on just the
timing of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I think there may be a little bit of front-end loading on the cost, obviously, to get the project going in the first
couple. But I think we will get some cost saves also as we work through this and we make some decisions of what
the organization will look like down the road. So, I think it's probably relatively even. Actually, the two amounts are
pretty close as well. So we've kind of viewed this if we can get this done and we can have a run rate that's got a
one-year payback to what it cost us to get this done, we think that's a pretty good consistent save going forward
for the cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
But we do expect to be able to get some of the expenses out during 2022. We won't be able to get all of them out,
but we will be able to start to. It's not like we're going to have all of the expenses incurred in the charter
consolidation and then we don't get any expense relief until the very end. That's not the way it'll be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. So, it sounds like get over the hump at the initial part and then additional expenses seem to be offset by
saves and it would be pretty minimal impact going forward and then you begin to outstrip on savings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And then assuming we can continue to grow, we'll get to a point where we believe we'll be more efficient
given that one charter and not have to do redundancy, so we can leverage future growth when we get towards the
end of this a lot better.

Yeah, so as we did when we did some of our customer compass work, we believe that will add capacity through
this as well. As Bryan was mentioning, since we grow, we won't have to add additional FTEs to support that
growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. Sorry, one last one. Just the – I got the sense, did you call forward some of the tax spend and other
projects that you have going that may have led to – I mean, and maybe just an update on where those costs are if
you look at the checks items on that slide you've got quite a bit complete. So I'm trying to get a sense for where
you sit on the expenses that might be embedded in your guidance, but just kind of wanted to update specifically
on where you are with the projects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're making good progress. We still have some that have not what we call landed yet to get on the
deck before we start consolidating. But those are based on a meeting even as late as this morning are
progressing as planned. And I think you'll see these costs that we have, both the consulting costs and the temp
people we've got in helping us get these done faster. Those costs will come down a little bit. And some of them
will then shift and their focus will be on to the charter consolidation, which will start flowing through the recurring
line. And then when that's done, they should go away. So, that's kind of the thought of how expenses should kind
of work through here.

Maybe a question for you, Bryan. I guess when you think about the outlook for 2022 and I appreciate your
thoughts earlier, do you think you can grow revenue faster than expenses? It sounds like mid-single-digit growth
in net interest income, flat fees. But on the expense side, you seemed a little bit cautious given wage inflation and
just pressure overall.

Yeah. I think ex-PPP, again, because that's pretty much done now, I think when you take that out and you look at
the core revenue growth, it can grow faster than expenses. Again, my biggest worry, as you heard me say it is,
unless we get this inflation that just will not go away, but I think even with that, we can get positive leverage.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just looking at the average balance sheet, C&I yields ex-PPP really came down the 4.33% to
4.02%, and kind of quite a bit of pressure on loan yields overall. Specific to the C&I, is that the ag – kind of
food/ag business that kind of was added to the balance sheet or is that just kind of market pressure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Terry, I think it's a fair amount of market pressure, but also I think that we are bringing on a better quality of
customer. So, the pricing is having – is lower, and we're seeing it reflected in our ALLL funding. So, I think it's
quality of customer, it's market conditions, and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think it's also, Terry, where some of the lower amortization for our purchase accounting discounts are coming
through there as well. I was just trying to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just last question here. 50 basis point increase in rates if I take $16 million plus $11 million, does
that equal $27 million in annualized net interest income? Is my math correct there, Bryan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That would be the annualized amount, and that's what you'll see in 2023, assuming no other changes. It will just –
yes, you're correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q

Perfect. Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks, everyone.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. You've actually covered most of what I wanted to go over, but some
on the loan pipeline and the loan growth. I'm just curious what are your customers telling you and what's driving
some of this growth? Is it market share gains, is there any new borrowing yet from clients? And then, are there
any locations that are doing better than others?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say a lot of our growth this quarter, as well as what's in the pipeline, is coming from our Western
and Southwestern markets. They're growing a little bit faster than here in the Midwest. Also, the agribusiness
group has a fairly significant pipeline, but it's gaining market share, but also our customers are starting to spend.
We're seeing a fair amount of capital expenditures now going on. Some of that is because they see their
increased demand. They feel it will be consistent. It's not just a spike up and then back down. So they're a lot
more confident in capital expenditure spending. We really haven't seen much in the way of line of credit utilization
increases. It was like up 1%, I mean, just a little bit. So it's not really on the utilization side. We haven't seen that
yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then so it would be safe to say like the loans out West with the pricing is more competitive than what
you're getting elsewhere, just after we're looking through – look through and see how far some of these loan
yields fell in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, we touched a little bit on that and Bryan jump in here. But as we are going upmarket a little bit into really
more of a middle market space, whether it's in the West or the Midwest, the pricing is much more competitive. We
are getting a little better pricing out West, but not like it is on the, say, loans $5 million and below.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think what I'm looking at, at least for the last month, so I looked at December, I always look at that right
before the meeting here. And it's interesting, the Midwest, the pricing seems tighter. The West has a wider range,
and I think that these larger, maybe better credit qualities are tending to get pricing at or even slightly below what
we see in the Midwest. But then there are some, the normal stuff that we've always done through years, it seems
to have a little bit higher price. So, there's a wider dispersion that we're seeing in pricing than we maybe had
historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. So, some of these [ph] new ones (00:38:39) are coming out for pricing, are you able to get more like
treasury management and card services along with that to help with the profitability?

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

bit more for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...of our overall strategy to go a little bit upmarket, better quality, and then it will increase our ability to cross-sell
into the products that we have whether it's treasury management, whether it's card, whether it's interest rate
swaps. So, I think, over time, you'll see us improve our fee income from those customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Bryan. Thank you for the update on the 50 basis point impact. Within that guide for your non-interest income,
what type of deposit beta are you assuming and is that deposit betas for your home deposit base or just your
interest-bearing deposits?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2022
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So, it is just for the interest-bearing deposits. Typically our non-maturity deposits will take CDs, which is pretty
small for us anyway. I think our normal is probably 40% to 45% beta as rates go up. So, 40% of the Fed move is
what our rates go up. Because of our strong base and because we're starting at such a low point, we assumed
relatively no betas for first 25 basis points and then we can assume 15% or 15 beta on those deposits. The
reason being, we do have some small portion of index. And so as rates go up, we will – those will have to go up,
but much less than what we normally would model in that 40% to 45% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, with the – talking about the expense side and I think you mentioned you
expected to come back down closer to the third quarter level for the next few quarters and that is exclusive of the
charter consolidation expenses, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. That would be correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Damon DelMonte Q

Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Hope everybody is doing well today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We are, Damon. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Just to kind of continue on the expense topic here, you mentioned that probably another 13 branches or
10% of the footprint looking to consolidate in 2022. Is there any timing around that and any potential financial
impact we could kind of factor in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think the timing for that is probably going to be late in the second quarter into the third quarter just with
regulatory filings and everything else we've got going on. We did, though, some of those branches I mentioned,
one of the things we did is we did move them for – to held for sale. So, what that does is it starts to slow down
some of the depreciation on those buildings. We pulled the mark of the value then at whatever we mark them or

the book value if we didn't have to mark them, so we can get them sold. So, there's a little bit of the expense that
came out relative to what – where run rate was coming in, but the biggest thing will be late second quarter, early
third quarter timeframe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, is there a way – is there a projected cost savings associated with that or those savings be
reallocated to other areas of the operation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No. I think we will – we'll try to hold on to those cost saves. I don't have the exact number here, but typically we
saved probably $300,000 to $ 400,000 per branch, depends on the size, depends on a lot of things, but that's
probably an average. So, you'll start to see some of that come in, like I said, later on in the second quarter, and
hopefully...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...there's more bigger piece in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, that's kind of what's helping you keep that like $30 million or $31 $million level then pretty much?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sorry, $31 million to $32 million level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, that's the fee income. That's on the expense side, Damon. So, that'll help us...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So, we need some of that because obviously the first quarter is $108 million. We've got to get the remaining
quarters to come down to be able to get our year-over-year to be that minimal increase that I talked about. So,
there's some work to be done on the expense side to get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Great. And then with respect to the reserve level, now I think you said it was $129 million ex-PPP at
the end of the quarter. With all this growth that's coming on, how do we think about the provision level going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And Nathan can jump in here, too. I think we are at $129 million, assuming that the economy holds
together and we get kind of past COVID and we get to maybe a little bit more stable place, we think that our
probably normalized run rate is probably in the closer to $120 million, maybe $122 million to $123 million,
somewhere near, between $120 million and $125 million of loans ex-PPP. So, we have, I think probably call it, 8
basis points, 9 basis points to come down. And that would be coming out of what we're holding in the economic
component of the reserve.
So then once you get past midyear assuming that that happens and when the economy holds together, then you'll
start seeing loans have to be provided for because they won't have the coverage at the end. Normalized that's
probably $3 million to $6 million a quarter depending upon – we believe charge-offs stay low. And if we can
continue to grow $200 million to $300 million a quarter, that's probably the range of what normalized would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess just lastly, with the agribusiness, could you just talk a
little bit more about some of the types of loans that they're making and the size of them and just give a little bit
more kind of color on this new business line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, I would say the size is anywhere from $5 million to, say, $25 million. We do have some growers, but we
also have processors. And so, it's not just pure kind of ag. I mean it's truly agribusiness, and it's a combination of
nuts, berries, leafy vegetables. I mean it's sort of what you would expect coming out of the Central Valley of
California. It's a wide range.

Mr. Lee for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Towanda. In closing, HTLF had a solid fourth quarter and a strong year. In 2021, organic loan growth
was $689 million or 7.6%. Organic non-time deposit growth was $1.7 billion or 12.3%. 42% of our deposits are in
non-interest-bearing accounts, positioning us well in a rising rate environment. We strategically invested for
growth through our talent acquisition strategy and we began realigning the organizational structure of the
company through charter consolidation. Our momentum continues into 2022 and we're well positioned to continue
driving growth.
I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late April. Have a good
evening.
