Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, thank you. Good morning. So, thank you very much, Sergio, and good morning to everybody. I will begin by
summing up the year. 2019 was a very good year for us. We have delivered on both growth, profitability and trend
targets. We grew loyal and digital customers again by 9% and 15% respectively year-on-year. And this has
resulted in quality growth in our revenues of 4%. That's again year-on-year.
Profitability. Our underlying return on risk-weighted assets has improved by 5 basis points. We have maintained
an underlying return on tangible equity of 11.8% while increasing by the way our tangible equity by €4.5 billion,
and that puts us well on track to achieve our-medium term goals of 13% to 15%.
We continue to be one of the most efficient and profitable banks among our peers, and a cost-to-income of 47%
remains best-in-class. And the combination has allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet, raising our
fully loaded CET1 to 11.65%, and that is despite regulatory headwinds this year of 62 basis points. So based on
these excellent results, we have announced today that the board will propose to the 2020 AGM in April a total
dividend per share in 2019 results of €0.23. Importantly though, €0.20 will be paid in cash and this represents a
close to 3% increase in our cash EPS this year. Again, we continue growing as we have over the past few years
our cash dividend. And basically, we have more than doubled the total cash dividend per share over the last five
years.
So going now to the next slide, here you can see P&L for the year. It's been a challenging environment especially
in Europe. We have delivered very solid and consistent revenue and profit growth with total revenues increasing
3% year-on-year on a constant currency basis and reaching a record €49.5 billion with underlying attributable
profit for the year also up 3% on a constant currency basis up to €8.3 billion. And very importantly accelerating
again in Q4, it's been an excellent quarter, better than the full year growing underlying profits at 5%.
Going onto the next slide, I would like to cover the three strategic priorities we set for ourselves back in April and
briefly summarized. You can see here how we have made progress this year on all three of them, improving the
operating performance across all regions, continuing to allocate our capital to those regions and businesses with
great discipline by the way that generate highest returns, and of course accelerating the digital transformation
through Santander Global Platform.

And underlying all of this and very important for us and for all the team is continuing to focus on building a
responsible bank, doing a lot of progress on culture across the group, changing the way we're working with very
different initiatives from flexi working, to diversity, to the rollout in many more countries of agile teams working
together across the group in all our core banks.
So, allow me to cover briefly the progress on each one of these pillars. During the year, if you go to the next slide,
we further leverage the diversification and scale of the group. And we have been improving our operational
performance across the regions, but also in our global businesses. We have simplified into a three region
management structure, which is delivering excellent results, we announced this in April.
There is a much more effective collaboration across the regions in parallel, but also converging against a common
group, ultimately building one single platform. Europe is successfully driving a simplification effort and delivering
results on efficiency. We generated about €200 million in net cost savings, that is about 20% of the €1 billion net
cost savings target.
And across Europe, Europe as a region has delivered 10% return on tangible equity. North America, again,
growing double-digit in all the key metrics, benefiting from high operational leverage from the group. With
underlying profit in the US growing by 24% year-on-year, again, after a very good year in 2018 and improving the
return on tangible equity by 111 (sic) [112] basis points. This is adjusted for excess capital.
Mexico, again, excellent performance. We've done major investment in Mexico, increasing customers and
maintaining a 19% year-on-year increase in profits and return on tangible equity of close to 21%. And last but not
the least, South America, which remains the group growth engine led by Brazil, delivering best results ever with
an 18% increase year-on-year in underlying, and at the same time, getting ready for the future increasing
efficiency and return on tangible equity up by 179 basis points to 21%.
If we now cover briefly the global businesses, this is a very, very important priority for all of us, José Antonio,
myself and all the teams to rally build global businesses so we can more and more leverage the group's scale and
strength. And you can see that today, these two global businesses are contributing 26% of the group's profit,
increasingly driving network effects and enhancing the competitiveness of our core banks. Corporate &
Investment Banking continues to grow strongly. Underlying profit was 10% higher and driven by a strong growth
in revenues. With a return on risk-weighted assets of 1.8% continues to improve over the years, one of the best
among peers.
Our Wealth Management division and Insurance which was created recently continues to improve. Total assets
under management grown by 13% in 2019 to very close to €400 billion and underlying profit growing by 11% to
€1 billion.
Last but not least, and I will give you a bit more detail on this later, Santander Global Platform continues to
progress, again working across the group on a horizontal basis and really helping us all the countries and
businesses create efficiencies but also grow revenues and customer experience.
Our digitalization strategy is paying off and you can see this in the positive evolution of digital metrics. We focused
on improving customer experience as the big driver to improve growth in customers. And this especially true in
mobile. We now have 37 million digital customers. As a reminder, we started five years ago with 14 million
subscribers, but just year-on-year, that's a 15% increase. And that now represents more than half our active
customers.

Our digital customers are more and more engaged. Just to give you an idea, digital customers engage online with
us five times per week. This results in 700 million digital touch points per month. But very importantly, this is also
translating into sales, and sales on the mobile channel have grown by two times in 2018. As a result of all of this,
36% of new products across the group sold in 2019 was through digital channels and reaching, by the way, 39%
in December 2019. That's a 7 percentage point year-on-year growth. It's important because customers are
increasingly using digital, so we are using and refocusing the branches more and more on the higher value-added
and more complex products, which of course is adding to strengthen relationships but also profitability.
And you can see some of these numbers in the next slide. The fact that digital sales are growing so strongly is
driving profitability. So our investments in digital are evident in these numbers. We can now deliver products more
efficiently. As you can see, the marginal cost of transaction is going down dramatically. But again, as an example,
in Brazil, we have it here on the slide, the cost for the bank of doing a transfer through digital channels is 99%
less than if the customer does this in the branch. But the UK, which is another great example, the cost of selling a
mortgage online is 50% less if done indeed on a digital basis.
So the improved operating performance and optimization of our capital allocation is enabling us to enhance our
profitability, and we are very, very focused on improving the return on risk-weighted assets performance by
regions. You can see here, we've been very consistent in terms of allocating more capital to the higher growth
and high-opportunity markets.
As a summary, in 2019, 73% of the group's risk-weighted assets generated already returns above the reference
return on risk-weighted assets, RoRWA, of 1.2% which is well above our cost of equity. This is 3 points increase
over last year, and really what it means is that we are bringing – and we've been doing this every year, but in
2019, an additional €20 billion of risk-weighted and €40 billion in nominal term loans were now above the cost of
equity compared to last year and improving the underlying RoRWA as we said by 5 basis points. All of this is
supported of course by improvements across the Americas and across the group.
Just as a reminder also where we are coming from, if we look back five years, 2014, the RoRWA was 1.27%. If
we calculate the capital we have back in 2014 and the RoRWA we have today of 1.61%, we would actually be at
a return on tangible equity of 17%. This is just a way to look at how we have improved the businesses over these
five years.
Of course we continue, as I said, with this accretive capital rebalancing and there is more capital allocated in this
case to South America and North America in a very consistent way. In Europe, the RoRWA allocated to Europe is
minus 1%; in North America, it's plus 4%; and South America, plus 7%. And this is, again, a measure of how we
are maximizing profitability and, at the same time, balancing this with keeping the franchise and investing for the
future. Another example of this rebalancing, of course, is the buyback of the minorities in Mexico, which we did in
2019.
In terms of what happened in 2019 in gross capital generation, as this business model and execution of our
strategy is progressing, we have generated a record 97 basis points gross capital in 2019. That is more than
double the guidance. This was, of course, partially offset by the 62 basis points of regulatory impact, which
resulted in a net plus 35 basis points increase to a CET1 of 11.65%.
It's important we have done this while increasing cash dividends per share and investing in the business. In total,
as you can see in this slide, during 2019, we generated the equivalent of €9.4 billion of capital pre-minorities. We
are, at these levels, very comfortable with our current not just capital levels, but also buffers over regulatory
requirements. And again, this is due to the resilience and diversification of our business.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Considering our 2019 CET1 and also the historical consistency five-year track record, where we've been
generating 40 basis points per year, we expect to be close to 12% by year-end 2020. This would place us ahead
of time at the top end of our 11% to 12% midterm goal. In 2020, we expect some quarterly volatility. We have
agreed to certain acquisitions during this year that will close. This is factor into the numbers and the expectation.
One of the examples is Allianz insurance business which we bought back recently or the acquisition of Ebury.
And, of course, reaching the top end of this capital goal by the end of 2020 means we will not need to continue to
accumulate capital and will provide additional strategic flexibility in terms of capital.
In summary, I would say 2019 has been an excellent year. We've made very significant progress in executing our
strategy. We've generated what I consider and what we consider outstanding results, and we've done this while
investing for the future and transforming the bank. We have also created shareholder value. We have increased
our tangible book value per share of plus cumulative cash dividend by 8%.
And importantly, we have done this while conducting our business in a responsible and sustainable way. That has
been really important for all of us and it's increasingly important to all 200,000 people and teams across the
Santander Group. I am very proud – we are very proud that Santander has been recognized as the most
sustainable bank in the world by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
We have also been named leader again for the second year in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. We are
more and more diverse at the board and at leadership level. And we have been improving and have very high
levels of employee engagement. 86% of our teams are proud to work at Santander. And this is recognized also as
across the countries where we have been recognized one of the top 10 best companies to work for in five of our
markets. And as a group, one of the top 25 best companies in the world to work for.
Again, we are working hard on all these levels, supporting financial inclusion but also supporting our customers in
the transition to a low-carbon economy, and as I said, helping inclusion and the under-served customers in all our
markets.
So I now leave you with José Antonio who will cover in a bit more detail our operating performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thanks, Ana, and good morning to everyone. 2019 P&L reflects, I will say, solid growth in customer revenue.
Good cost management that reflects the synergies obtained in some countries and provisions growing basically in
line with volumes.
I also want to say that we see great sustainability quarter-on-quarter after quarter. In Q4, we generated underlying
profit of around €2.1 billion. That is 5% higher than the fourth quarter in last year, and excluding the deposit
warranty fund contribution in Spain, 5% more than the third quarter in 2019. In addition, we have had this quarter
the positive impact of €711 million, the net capital gains and provisions, which boosted attributable profit in the
quarter to around €2.0 billion. Further – you have the detail of non-recurring items in the appendix in page 47
broken down by quarters.
I will summarize now the main items in Q4 that were the capital gains from custody; for custody, €693 million,
DTA recoveries due to changes in tax regulation in Brazil, €551 million; net capital losses related with disposal of
real estate business in Spain, €225 million; restructuring costs in several countries, €140 million. Those are the
main set items.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
So, as a result, net capital gains and provisions in 2019 amounted to €1.7 billion, of which approximately €1.5
billion do not impact capital.
Going to the revenues. We reached record high revenues of more than €49 billion. While revenue will be
characterized with very high quality, 95% of the revenue comes from the more recurrent and stable lines NII and
fee income. And the total revenue grew 4%, boosted by the Americas and our global business, while Europe
remained flat.
Net interest income grew 4%, very much in line with the business volumes combined with active management of
the spreads. We continue to see – expect further improvement in the cost of deposits. Net fee income grew 5%.
Well, at least it's worth stressing, as Ana said, that our global business are growing significantly faster than that,
and the global business already represent 40% of the total fees generated by the group. We are confident that we
can continue to deliver high-quality revenue going forward.
On the cost side, this reflects very well with the – our execution. In Europe, costs dropped in nominal terms 1.3%,
in real terms 2.4%, reflecting the synergies integration and optimization and simplification process that Ana
referred to previously. The decrease in Spain was €300 million of the cost base. We expect additional strong fall
next year. Portugal is also reducing cost, and UK is probably – we are starting their results in the transformation
program with the second half of the 2019 the cost coming down and a process that will accelerate in 2020.
In North America, both countries are increasing cooperation in order to improve commercial capabilities and
eliminate duplicate costs. Lastly, cost control in South America combined with business growth and strong
improvement in efficiency. So, in short, cost management enabled us to remain leaders in efficiency with cost to
income of 47%. Credit quality, well, [indiscernible] (20:06), the NPL ratio continues to fall, the cost of credit is flat,
coverage is at healthy levels.
Let me do – make a short summary of the group performance in the year. Increase in our underlying profit,
strength in the capital ratio, improving credit quality while maintaining best-in-class efficiency; high profitability,
both in terms of return on tangible equity and RoRWA; and improved tangible net asset value per share plus
dividends.
Going to the business areas, you can see the 53%, remaining very well diversified. 53% of the underlying profit
comes from the Americas and 47% from Europe, while the profit is growing in 9 out of the – our 10 core markets,
particularly growing at double digit in Brazil, US, Mexico, and Poland. Our Global business has also increased at
double-digit rates; enable us to strengthen our local franchise through the Global business.
When it comes to volumes, loan growth was 4%; deposit growth, pretty much the same; mutual funds grew 15%.
And the loan growth, you see different patterns in line with our previous guidance. Still the leverage in Spain and
Brazil being more – Spain, sorry, the leverage in Spain and Portugal being more selective in our lending in those
countries due to the profitability issues, and growing in all the other markets, particularly in South America. And
also, I want to remark the US that is growing pretty well.
Going by countries, 2019 in Spain has been the year in which we complete the Popular integration. This was the
main task for the year. Having said that, we are seeing positive dynamics in individuals, growth in consumer
activity, and in value-generating business such as insurance and mutual funds. Nevertheless, the stock of credit
fell 6% year-on-year due to wholesale banking deleveraging and a slowdown in mortgages. Mainly, some of these
deleverage is because we are, as Ana already mentioned, being more active in our capital allocation.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
In results, profit fell 18% in the quarter. It was through the deposit guarantee scheme grow – grew 14%.
Underlying profit in the year was higher, mainly driven by a strong reduction in costs. Total income was – we
improved the retail customer NII, primarily boosted by the fall of – in cost of funding. The [indiscernible] (22:50)
was offset by the lower contribution from the ALCO portfolio, the negative impact of IFRS 16, and lower wholesale
balances. NPL ratio keep improving.
In 2020, we expect the cost to continue to fall sharply and credit quality indicators should improve. In revenue, we
expect a stable NIM with better funding cost and lower revenue from financial transactions due to the smaller
ALCO portfolio. We expect profitability to remain well above of our cost of equity.
In Consumer Finance, another good year. Our market share against the market, the auto market is now growing
in Europe, we are growing 5%, so market share gains and – while we continue to reach agreements with OEMs
that provide a good starting point for the future to keep growing as we've been doing in the last couple of years. In
2020, we see volume growth, some pressure on margins, the cost growing below business growth, and the cost
of credit remaining at good levels going forward.
In the UK, we face a operating environment characterized by high levels of competition and uncertainty. Good
year in volumes. Revenue was affected by pressure on mortgage margins, particularly SVR attrition and overdraft
regulation. Costs went down 2.7% in real terms, better trend in the second half as I said before, and we
maintained very low cost of credit.
In the quarter, better top line trends in, particularly, NII and cost. Net operating income after provisions increased
8%. By 2020, we expect continued revenue pressure which could be offset with the cost reduction. So we are on
– we expect to be on track to achieve our medium-term profitability targets announced in Investor Day.
When it comes to Mexico, excellent performance both in the year in terms of cost as volume for growth. Our
transactionality is growing at more than 50%, this is a remarkable number while we continued to improve our
profitability with return on tangible equity close to 21% while the year was good, 19% profit growth year-on-year.
In 2020, we expect solid business dynamics to continue which should drive future – further profit growth.
In the States, I will say another good year in the States. Underlying profit grew 24%. Volumes grew significantly.
Credit, 12%; customer funds, 11%. Revenue increased due to greater volumes, offset lower interest rates. Loan
loss provisions increased only by 1%. In Q4, as you well know, we have the usual seasonal impact, particularly in
SCUSA, but by the way is doing very well. Originations grew significantly during the year and credit quality
remains healthy. In 2020, we are confident that this performance will continue, thanks to our commercial and
operative capabilities and the greater cooperation with Mexico.
Finally, we're going to elaborate in Brazil. Positive momentum, we keep gaining market share in key markets. Our
– in Retail, our growth was 16%; Consumer Finance, 17% year-on-year; and demand deposits, 24%. Profitability
improved again. Our return on tangible equity is above 21% and underlying profit grew 16%. Net interest income
was driven by volumes, some margin pressure. Net fee income grew very well based on insurance, market share
gains, payments gains, and securities market share gains.
Efficiency and cost of credit has historic lows, from around 40% five years ago to 33%, cost/income; and cost of
credit from 5% to below 4% that we think is sustainable. In 2020, we expect to maintain high profitability boosted
by market share gains and profit growth, backed by greater volumes that will offset margin pressures. No material
change in the cost of credit we expect in 2020.

Well, to finish, other countries, I'm not going to elaborate in other countries. You have all the information in the
Appendix. You have the information, positive performance in Portugal, Poland, Argentina, Chile and the others
growing well, and with all of them double-digit except Chile at 7%, slightly impacted by the fourth quarter in the
country.
In relation with the Corporate Center, two – only to mention two points, we have – the income was impacted by
greater falling currency hedging in the region of €300 million. The counterpart of this is in the conversion of results
to euros in certain countries. Lower NII due to the higher stock of issuance in – and IFRS 16 impact. Cost
decreased by 12%. You have further detail in the regions and Global business, I already commented. You can
find all these informations in the Appendix.
I'll now hand back to Ana to finish this presentation.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much, José Antonio. So, I would like now just to briefly look at the future and really remind us of
our strategy. Our strategy has not changed. We have a clear vision. We have a clear purpose. We are aiming to
help people and businesses prosper and do this in a way that is simple and personal and fair.
Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting responsibly and also, earning the lasting
loyalty of our stakeholders. I am very proud of the progress we have made since we launched in 2014 and I must
say I am, every time, every year, more excited about the future.
So, we will continue to leverage our unique business model to drive performance and also to make a better place
for the future. We have maintained and built this year again based on our global scale with leading market
positions, in-market positions, in lending in 9 of our 10 core markets. We are relentlessly focusing on customers.
We have improved our loyal customer base by 72% since 2014, and we are very proud that we rank amongst the
top 3 banks in customer satisfaction as measured by NPS in six countries.
Finally, we have a diversified geographical footprint operating in both emerging and mature markets. And it is
precisely this acceleration in execution, which we aimed for at the beginning of 2019, we have done this coupled
with our loyalty strategy and our focus on profitability which has allowed us once more to be more resilient, more
predictable than peers, and also to generate growth.
Since 2014, we've built a very strong foundation for the future. We have significantly reinforced our capital with
the CET1 increasing by €22 billion over the period. That is 338 basis points in five years. At the same time, we've
improved our return on tangible equity by 84 basis points. Our return on risk-weighted assets is 34 basis points
higher, and earnings per share has grown over the period by 22%.
Importantly, this performance has been also targeted – sorry, also supported by additional investments. And that
includes around €5 billion per annum in digital and technology, restructuring our legacy but also investing for the
future and increasing efficiency. We also spent over €2 billion over the period to restructure our banks.
We have grown our capital and invested in our business. We have also delivered value for our shareholders. We
have returned to shareholders over this time €18 billion in dividends. I want to stress this because this is a very
strong signal that the board and management has huge confidence in the future. And we've grown our tangible
net asset value per share by 19%, just note that this includes minorities.

So, again, we are confident that our strategy will allow us to achieve our mid-term targets. We made this public in
April last year. We are today also adding another guidance to the market, which is high single-digit underlying
EPS CAGR over the next three years. And this compares very favorably with our peer group and European
banks, and we believe that this is something we can deliver.
Going back to what I already mentioned and we set out in April of last year, so I would like briefly to cover the
future in terms of the three pillars that we're working across the group which, again, continuing to improve the
operating performance across the regions; continuing and with taking additional organizational incentives in 2019
that we're implementing again in 2020 to make sure that everybody is aligned towards the goal of maximizing
profitability and return on risk-weighted assets; but very importantly, also working to accelerate Santander Global
Platform.
I want to also stress that building a more responsible bank is a huge priority for all of us. And this is not just slides,
this is more and more embedded across the organization at all levels. We're implementing new measures. We
recently announced in November or December that we aim to have our own activity as a bank, carbon footprint by
net zero by reducing emissions and compensating where we are not able to reduce down to zero. And this then is
at the core. It's not just about the carbon footprint, it's much more than that, of course. It's diversity and so on, and
this is at the core of our performance going forward.
You can see here the targets. We maintain all the targets we set out in April. So, you've seen this before. We
reiterate our targets for both Europe, for North America, and South America. And really the goal behind this is, as
I said, to operate as One Santander. We are working across the regions to accelerate this aim and it's working
but, obviously, the goal is to converge.
Europe is going to remain challenging, but I see it on the positive side. If we can succeed in Europe, we'll be
much more successful eventually in the rest of the world because it is the hardest environment by far. We do not
just want to reduce costs, we want to do this in a structural way by having the vision of where banking is going for
the future and then implementing towards that vision.
In North America, we're also working together, leveraging the size of our Mexican bank and grow – and actually
working together with the US with a very ambitious plan that we set out three, four years ago and we, again, will
be focusing here on profitable growth. But in South America, exactly the same, we are not just working on
revenues, we're also working on building common platforms, and you will see more of this during 2020. So, just in
summary, to say that I'm very confident we will achieve the return on tangible equity and efficiency targets that we
set out in April of last year.
So, at the core of our plans for the last five years, we've accelerated the optimization of capital this year. We
needed to do that, and you can see that when we need it, we're able to manage our balance sheet to deliver more
growth in our capital – in organic capital. We continue to [indiscernible] (34:42) to the most profitable geographies.
We are setting minimum profitability thresholds, not just by country but by segments.
We have already, and it's taken us a couple of years, but we have the tools to manage this across the group, and
we're working on faster asset rotation. This – you'll see this again this year. We have a new organization where
our CFOs also have the mandate of CIOs, Chief Investment Officers. This has been implemented or will be
implemented in the next month. And we expect that the combination of all these efforts will enable us to deliver
this mid-term underlying RoRWA of 1.8% to 2%.

So, if we look at now at digitalization and building Santander Global Platform, this is probably the most strategic of
our goals but it's – really, it's working on two levels. We're going to continue the digitalization of our banks and the
group, transforming our core banks to be completely digital front to back. And we can see the progress in some of
the numbers I gave you earlier.
We are leveraging more and more common capabilities. We have many examples of tools that are developed
centrally or in a country and then shared across the group. We have a lot of agile teams working already which
are improving customer experience and helping us on efficiency. Just let me mention one, which is recently, we're
in Mexico, and Mexico as a country, saved about 80% of the cost to develop its SME best-in-class mobile app by
using the Global Services which we had developed together across the group on the individual banking app.
Again, this is happening more and more, sharing across countries. And we are also, and that's the second part of
our strategy, building global digital banking solutions with payments at the core. And this will be not just for our
own banks but for others, so third parties. And this is going to amplify these investments we're making in the
payments platform and the global digital bank.
Just very briefly on SGP, you will be hearing more and more about this over the next few years. We have already
created the segment but it's still work in progress. It's not the end product. It's really a move to become a global
leader in payments and digital banking solutions because these are key drivers, this is not new, it's always been
the case, but the key drivers of customer loyalty, both for SMEs and individuals.
And similar to the way our global businesses of Corporate Banking and Wealth and Insurance, what SGP aims is
to leverage our scale, our footprint, and our expertise in payments and financial services which will enable us – it's
actually already enabling us – to build our own digital assets and fintech solutions just once and then deploy
across the group. And this will dramatically lower development costs and time to market.
As I said, we expect SGP to serve initially our own banks and their customers, but in a second stage, also third
parties, and we're actually beginning already to test this, and to build best-in-class payment and digital banking
solutions. As of today, we are focusing on these four high-growth, large addressable markets in which we can and
are already delivering results, I have briefly covered that.
In the next slide, if we think about SMEs, we're focusing on two verticals. One is merchant acquiring and the other
one is international trade. Global Merchant Services is based on a company we acquired in Brazil, Getnet. Getnet
has doubled market share in Brazil, a very competitive market in the last five years. Very high customer
engagement, about 30% annual transaction growth since 2013. I want to say that Santander is already a top 10
global acquirer by turnover volume in the world, and we are already launching in Mexico this quarter and we have
plans, detailed plans to roll it out in another eight countries over the next couple of years.
Global Trade Services, again, we have 200,000 SME customers, real, very loyal customers across the group that
trade. This is a large and a growth market. To accelerate our progress, we're basically following the footprint,
same footprint or path as we did with Getnet. Ebury, we worked for two, three years really scouring the whole
world what is that kind of team we wanted. And I want to stress, the Ebury team is one of the main reasons that
we've done this acquisition, but they also have a great track record. They're growing 45% the top line year-on-
year and it's a best-in-class trade and foreign exchange facilitator. We're going to build around it, a – again, a
global platform for trade for all our countries and we're expecting to be rolling out to 20 markets very soon.
Finally, for individuals, we were again working on two lines on the affluent segment even though it's also very
interesting for others and the underserved. Superdigital, again, a Brazilian – a small acquisition. It's a simple and
11

flexible way, we call it pre-banking service. It's really a market where, just in Latin America, we estimate 300
million underserved people, customers. We aim to provide them with basic financial products in a way that is also
profitable or, let's say, gives sensible returns for the bank.
To give you also a vision of what we're building around SGP, Superdigital is already working in Brazil with Getnet
GMS. So, really, all of these building blocks can work with each other. We're actually already live with Superdigital
in not just Brazil but Mexico and Chile, and growing customers at about 60% annually and transactions almost
two times faster. And the goal is to reach over 5 million active customers over the next few years.
And, finally, Openbank, which is our global full-service digital bank. What's different from Openbank to other new
banks is that there are real customer relationships. These are not just users. Openbank was either first or second
highest growth bank in Spain in 2019 – 2018, I don't remember the year. And very importantly, and this is a very
important measure, with 115 (sic) [115,000] payroll accounts which means that there is more and more loyal
customers, and as you can see, 4.4 products per customer, but a new product, which is mortgages, end-to-end
mortgages growing at 134%.
This is a business model which should give us, in a steady state, around 20% ROE in Europe, and we are live
already not just in Spain, but Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal and launching in other countries over the
next few years.
So, as a summary, again, 2019 was a very good year, all the regions delivered, solid operating performance. We
grew the top line, record revenue, and we improved profitability. Our capital position is strong. It's been a record
year in terms of organic capital generation, reaching 11.65% CET1. We are very comfortable with our current
capital levels and buffers, and are well-positioned to take advantage of what we see as very significant
opportunities for profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders.
Based on this performance, the board agreed yesterday to propose a close to 3% increase in our 2019 cash
dividend per share. Just to – and I'd say that as we head into 2020 and beyond, we have a clear, we have a
focused strategy in place which gives us a very high degree of confidence that we will deliver on our medium-term
goals, including the high-single-digit earnings per share CAGR over the next three years.
So, thank you very much and we now have time for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes, hello. So, thank you very much for the presentation. I wanted to start with capital. So, first of all, if you can
update on the regulatory impacts on capital ratio suspected for 2020, either negative depending impact from
TRIM or eventually positive. If you can update on where are you on the models in the UK.
And then also on some of the corporate transactions, if you can comment on the impact from the SCUSA tender
offer and if you think that this, together with the sale of Puerto Rico, will be enough to offset the other, the
acquisitions of the Allianz and the Ebury deal? And then also beyond 2020, what other regulatory impacts shall
we expect? And, in particular, if you can update on the guidance for Basel IV and where do you plan to be in
terms of capital in a post-Basel IV world? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, as we said, I mean I want to reiterate, and it's very important that 11.65%, we are very comfortable with the
level and with the buffers vis-à-vis regulatory requirements. Regarding 2020, keeping our mid-term goal of being
between 11% to 12%, what we are doing is we are accelerating, reaching 12%. So we said medium term, close to
12%. We expect, given the business model transformation and profitability and the fact that we generated 40
basis points per year, to be close by 12% by year end.
There will be some inter-quarterly volatility. As you know and as you said, we will have Allianz and Ebury and
some other purchases, we will have some offsetting, partially offsetting sales and there will be some remaining
negative headwinds. With all of that in consideration, we expect to be close to 12% by the end of 2020.
In terms of Basel IV, again, what we are saying here is that we are very confident we can absorb Basel IV and
maintain an attractive dividend policy and finance profitable growth. I want to say that we absorbed 60 basis
points of regulatory headwinds in 2019. At the same time, we grew our loans by 4%. And as I mentioned, we are
proposing to the shareholders' meeting cash DPS growth of close to 3%.
The number that was mentioned in the Q3 call of 100 basis points has several caveats. First, that it is a very
preliminary number and it is pre-mitigation, so there are some mitigation measures that were not considered.
Second is that we do expect other positive regulatory issues would be the capital treatment of intangibles, for
example, that would help us. But last but not least, we still expect the impact to be less than peers. I think I've
answered all of the questions. Thank you.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. My question – two questions. First of all, on the 12% target for this year,
when you think about – obviously, there's been some disappointments for the last couple of years. When you
think about visibility of those headwinds that you've outlined and that 12% target, are you much more confident on
the visibility now of the regulatory headwinds, in particular TRIM or EBA guidelines or all the long list? Is the – has
the visibility of those impacts improved and are you in a position as a result to sort of get rid of the scrip dividend
for 2020?
And the second question is on your high single-digit EPS growth consensus, I think it's more – probably half of
that. When you think of the last year, since you gave your target, obviously, margin pressure is worse, certainly in
developed markets than you probably thought. So is cost the offset of that? Is it that once you reach your 12%
target, you're going to be able to deploy more capital to grow the business? Just a bit of color on if it's going to be
front-end loaded, back-end loaded versus consensus expectations as a general commentary. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, please let me be clear that the target is not 12%. The target is to be between 11% and 12%. So, as we said in
April, our target is to be between 11% and 12%. We are going to get close to 12% just by the natural profitability
of improvement of our model. We have delivered every year what we said we would deliver. And it's clear that not
– we're very predictable year-on-year, but it's hard to be very predictable quarter-on-quarter.
And my sense is that when one quarter we're a bit below – again, what matters is not just the levels but the
buffers against the regulatory requirements. And as we said, we are very comfortable. And I have to say over the
last five years, just to give you an example, the UK capital levels, our bank in the UK is now going to be at 14%.
That's 100 basis points more than a year ago. So there have been in some places increases, and we've been
able to absorb that.
And I think what gives us high confidence is that when we need to absorb 60 basis points, we can do that
organically. Obviously, risk-weighted assets grew less in 2019 than we probably could have done, by the way,
profitably. So, what you'll see once we don't have this 60 basis points, like we had this year, is you should expect
higher profitable growth in places like Brazil. I mean Brazil should grow faster next year. And given we still have
some regulatory headwinds next year, we've actually taken some of that already in Q4, something like 9, 10 basis
points, you should see some impact but nothing near what we saw this year.
So, to answer your question, I think we do have higher visibility. The tone is actually different. There are some
positives ahead that will come in play even in 2020 in terms of being able to cover through Pillar 2 some of the
requirements. But I want to stress that our aim is to be between 11% and 12%, get close to 12%, and then be
able to have some volatility there to maximize the opportunities for our shareholders.
The high single-digit EPS, that is for the three years. Again, it might be more one year than another, so it's not a
mathematical, let's say, progression, but what's important is the CAGR for these three years. And the model we
have always means that some countries are going to do a bit better than others. The opportunities because of the
macro, because of the market conditions are better in one market than another, and that is essentially the model
we have where we can rebalance and reallocate capital.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Just to give you an idea of the flexibility we have in terms of capital allocation and what we've done in 2019 very
successfully, is that about a third of our balance sheet gets replaced every year. So, we have a lot of control as to
what assets we put into the books. We are doing more and more originate to distribute because other entities are
more efficient holders of loans, but we want to maintain the relationship with our customers because that's what
give us the strength to build a global platform.
So, I'd say that, again, the earnings per share goal for the next three years is, I think, a very good sign that the
medium-term targets we set for ourself will be reached.

Forgot the scrip. Yes, the scrip, sorry about that. So, the scrip is – we explained this last year and my job and the
job of the board, José Antonio, all of us is to try to make all our shareholders happy. But not all shareholders are
the same, and about 45% of the company is owned by retail shareholders, and they love the scrip. And so –
we've been reducing it. With the proposal we're taking, we're taking it down to 13% of the total will be scrip. And
we have said that depending on how the year progresses, we might actually buy back the scrip. So, that's
something that gives us added flexibility.
We're trying to keep everybody happy, and not everybody is going to be happy as happy all the time but we're
really – I mean the current management is very focused on earnings per share, tangible NAV per share, and we
are very conscious that this is important for many of you on the call but we also have to consider our 45% retail
shareholders. So, depending on the year, we might – I'm saying we might, we have authorization from the
shareholders. We asked for that last year.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrea Unzueta from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Unzueta Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi, thank you. I wanted to get more clarity on your expectations of earnings growth for Brazil and Mexico in
particular. We're seeing a lot increased competition in both regions in fees, in particular, in Brazil and a lot of
margin pressures in Mexico, so a bit of visibility on what your earnings growth expectations are in those regions
would be helpful. And also, if you could, remind me whether the impact of higher taxes in Brazil should have an
impact on our expectations for 2020. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Sure. So let me just give you the sort of my high level view and then I would let José Antonio to complement a bit
more guidance. But I'd say, all in all, the good news for us is that in 2019, across South America and Mexico,
growth was more or less zero. So from Mexico down to all of South America, zero growth.
This year, we're expecting Brazil actually to be between 2% to 3% growth. We're expecting Mexico to grow a bit
more. Chile is the only one we're expecting less growth. So the first message, the first positive is that we expect
volume growth. I always say this, that we make a lot of our profits in South and Latin America but we lend very
little money. We – actually, you can see that, and that's a huge opportunity. There's a lot of profitable growth
ahead. So, especially in Brazil, margins will obviously be much lower with interest rates at 4%, 4.5%, but volumes
and very good quality growth is ahead.
To give you an example, last year, we did already €2 billion in mortgages in Brazil. I mean, a few years ago, that
was like unheard of. So we expect volume growth to compensate margin. But very importantly, and this is
something – in Latin America, we have not waited for things to happen, we started in April of last year working
across the region with very significant – and you can see the numbers already in Brazil with a lot of focus on cost,
a lot of focus on building common platforms. So you are going to see efficiency improvements. We're going to
invest, but we're going to follow in this – the other way, the example of Europe, that we need to become much
more efficient. So those are two things that are important.
Taxes will go up in Brazil by 3, I think, 3 points? 3 points, yeah, and that's considered. So when you consider all of
that, Mexico, Brazil, we're expecting roughly the same profitability this year, roughly. And I think this guidance was
given in October by Brazil. We reiterate the guidance of Mexico, Brazil, somewhere around 20%, 21% return on
tangible equity. I think that's some – so José Antonio says he's fine so...

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, on Poland, can you give us an update on Polish Swiss franc
mortgage mitigation? Did you take a provision in the quarter? And secondly, the ECB hosted a call yesterday on
SREP requirements. In the call, they stated that the average Pillar 2G for G-SIBs and universal banks was 1%. I
know you're not allowed to tell us your Pillar 2G, but is there any reason why Santander wouldn't be in line with
the average G-SIB and universal banks? Could Santander, in fact, be any better than average due to the
relatively strong performances in the stress test? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So I will let José Antonio answer on Poland, but on ECB, the SREP, obviously, we cannot comment on P2G but
it's clear that Santander has delivered through the cycle more predictable, more sustainable growth.
Diversification works across 25, 20, and 5 years. That's all I can say. But, obviously, the GCP is different and so
doesn't necessarily have to be the same SREP requirement. We cannot say anything, right? Good. So we cannot
say more than that, but we do – I mean, I might say we are seeing a bit of a change in the tone and there is a
Pillar 2 change that will come into effect at the beginning of next year, which is obviously a benefit, would be a
benefit for most banks including ourselves. And Poland?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, in relation with the Swiss franc portfolio, we have a portfolio in Poland of around CHF 2.6 billion portfolio,
CHF 2 billion in the bank, CHF 600 million in the Consumer Finance operation. After the ECB court ruling in
September 2019, the final outcome will be decided by – on a case-by-case basis by the courts.
As a matter of fact, the rulings we have had in – now in the courts that are a small number, around 30 cases, we
won around two-thirds of these and one-third were in favor of the customer. So, we took a provision in the fourth
quarter that I think cover us for the current expectations. So it's – but I can – we can say at this time we're going
to see on a case-by-case basis what happens in the courts in the coming years, but we feel comfortable with the
provision we took at the end of the year.

Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. The first one is about the cost to income in Spain excluding
trading income, it seems still very weak. So, a couple of issues related to that. Could you help us understand
17


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
when you expect stabilization in the top line in Spain and, please, could you give more details on cost savings in
Spain next year – well, next year, current year, 2020?
And then finally, in Spain again, could you give us some color on impairments in Spain? I mean your NPL ratio is
still very high, coverage below peers, so there is an obvious trade-off between accelerating the reduction of NPLs
and impairments. Could you give us some clarity on impairments? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Let me just take that and then José Antonio, please, if you can, complement. But I understand Spain this
year, cost/income was 53%, which is actually not that bad if you consider negative rates and where other banks
including the – some of the large American banks are, but we certainly aim to improve that and the cost savings
for next year will continue. I think we're aiming for like, something like mid-single-digit. But remember that the key
numbers are Europe, because we have a number of transversal across the group European initiatives. So that is
what matters now.
I mean that is the great strength of Santander. It's not a Spanish bank, it's not a UK bank, it's a European bank
with about €11 billion, I think, we closed in 2018 and we've said we'd reduce €1 billion, €1.2 billion over the next
few years. So, there are very significant savings coming in of that €1 billion next year, much more than this year. I
mean if this year, it was about €200 million, we did have a change in perimeter this year. We're not expecting that
for next year, I understand but, José Antonio, maybe you can help me there. So, you'd see not just Spain but
Europe coming down significantly in the cost base next year.
Impairments, I mean – and NPLs, all of this, obviously, comes in great measure by Popular. Do you want to
comment on those, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Yeah. Impairments, it's true that we have of the – our peers, in NPLs, it comes from Popular when you say
these impairments. So, what I can tell you is we are reducing quite rapidly these NPLs and we expect to continue
to do so with the cost of credit, cost of risk that is going to be in line, not below the one we have had this year.
So, it's true but we are – I feel comfortable with the coverage we have. But it's true that it's still – is going to take a
little of time to reduce the level to the level we should have that is currently above 6%. As a matter of comparison,
if you were on in Santander business will be around 3% or below 3%, yeah, so – and this is comes basically from
this. But the most important thing from the P&L point of view, the cost of risk is going to remain in line with what
we have or slightly below.
And the cost, probably to elaborate a little bit more on the cost side, we reduced this year cost in Spain €300
million. This is a nominal number. Probably next year, we're going to be aligned with this number again. We are
making a great effort and the Popular integration is going to be reflected – somehow were reflected this year, but
next year it's going to come in the same line. And in Europe, as Ana mentioned, our target was to reduce – or is to
reduce €1 billion nominal cost down. This year, we got €200 million, what you see in the numbers is €130 million.
You – we'll have some changes in perimeter in Poland and some others, but the number is €200 million this year.
Probably next year, probably it should be the double of this or around double of this nominal number. Going down
in Europe is coming from basically Spain and UK.

Thanks, Mario. Next question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jose Abad from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jose Abad Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
[audio gap] . My first question is on capital. In the quarter report, you mentioned that part of the organic
generation in the quarter was due to some risk-weighted asset optimization. So, here, I think I have two questions
which is – one is that you signed a risk sharing agreement with EIB for a €2 billion SME loan portfolio in Spain. I
think that was in late October. So, the question here is whether the full impact from this scheme is already fully
capture by Q4 numbers or that we should expect the impact from this scheme to be accrued gradually over the
next few quarters.
Related to this topic is, if you could, tell us about what's the potential amount of capital CET1 that you plan to
generate through the full implementation of your IRB internal models rollout plan across the group. And if I may,
one quickly on credit quality, it's clear that you are positive based on your last comment but we see divergent
trends within the group, so we see a margin – a sequential increase in the cost of risk in Santander Consumer
Finance, at the same time, a meaningful decline in Spain.
So, I think, I guess here, it would be useful to have your view on what's driving actually better quality, credit quality
trends in your view in a context of a slower growth globally. I mean, particularly, if you could, also comment on
what is the level and your expectations for the cost of risk in the Consumer segment in Spain. Thank you very
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Okay. On capital, again, we generated 97 bps gross in 2019. I mean, as I said before, looking every quarter, I
understand sometimes that you expect more and other times less, but what we have done is delivered across the
year. And this is what I would like to stress, is we are very confident on the model, on the predictability,
sustainability, but it's very difficult to measure quarters, approvals, and markets.
And so we've been very consistent for five years, 40 basis points per year. When we needed to do more, we have
done more and we've done it, I believe, the right way by basically increasing thresholds in terms of assets that
come on the books. We're ready to do that because our focus is on profitable growth, but profitability is very
important.
Securitizations will continue. I mean, I will let José Antonio answer that very technical question, although we're
going to see the impact next year. Internal models, I mean, as you know, that's one of the factors, both pluses and
minuses, for all European banks. But we have higher, much higher visibility now on what's coming and what the
effects are, and so that's why we are giving the guidance we're giving. We expect to be at 12% given the
profitability and given what we know today.
But I will let now José Antonio answer you on the – what happened in Q4, but there was a lot more securitization.
But we are using this as a BAU tool, by the way, because we want to keep the customer relationships. We think
19


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
that is very profitable business for the bank, and we have thresholds and we securitize where it makes more
sense in terms of returns on capital.
Very briefly on credit quality across the group, the cost of credit across the group this year was 100 basis points,
and for next year, I can give you guidance that it should be the same, about 100 basis points but there are some
ups and downs. I'm not sure how much guidance you want to give on that but, José Antonio, maybe you can take
it from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Well, you mentioned that the slower growth globally may affect our cost of risk. I should say that I cannot
agree with this, yeah? Brazil is going to grow faster in 2020 than it grew in 2019. Mexico is going to do the same.
So, our main portfolios somehow were portfolios that have a relatively high cost of risk, and we expect a better
environment.
You referred specifically to Santander Consumer Finance. The gross provisions were pretty much the same in the
fourth quarter than in the third quarter. You saw in the fourth quarter higher provisions because we disposed less
portfolios, but the gross provisions were pretty much the same. And in Spain, I already comment on these.
You mentioned the Consumer segment in Spain. We are not seeing a particular trend in Spain, although I've seen
in the media some numbers ticking up. Remember that our consumer lending in Spain in Consumer is basically
auto lending, is behaving very well, is basically new cars, is good quality. And in the bank, our loyal customers,
we – is pre-granted credits that will have a strong relationship with the customers.
You asked specifically for the EIB. EIB, what shows is our policy vis-à-vis securitizations that – the guide for our
securitizations that is becoming, as Ana said, business-as-usual is we securiticize (sic) [securitize] as long as we
can release capital, free up capital at a cost that is well, well below our cost of equity. So – and this is mainly, it's
happening in our Consumer Finance operations both – in both sides of the Atlantic, in SCUSA in the US and
Consumer Finance in Europe, and will continue to do so. I will qualify these as an asset business-as-usual more
than that we are doing something on our one-on-one basis.
EIB operation was included in Q4 but is meaningless in terms of capital, yeah. It's very small.

Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just have one question, on the strategy in Spain, just a bit to understand, when do you
think the deleveraging of the loan book will finish? We have seen again a year of weak lending growth. I have a
feeling that you are reshaping a lot the balance sheet, focusing on more profitable segments but if you could just
elaborate a bit on that and what would be the impact in NII for 2020? Thanks.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So the deleveraging in Spain has been mainly in the larger corporates. I mean, its sector continues to deleverage
and probably the public sector. As you well said, we're growing very well in consumer lending. And I think our
guidance for next year will be more stable, so not a full, but more stable volumes. And actually we're aiming for
stable margins also on the customer side. But I would like to flag that for next year also, and you can see that
because you can see that in the numbers this year, there will be less of a financial revenues through the ALCO
because we have disposed some portfolio. So, I'd say next year, you should expect higher quality earnings in
Spain, good management of margins, stable volumes overall but less financial income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. As a matter of fact, the deleveraging you are seeing is driven by the – our – we've been selective being
conscious of the good usage of capital in segments where the profitability is very low. So we've been – we're
elaborating the previous quarters around these and that affects, as Ana said, the corporate – the large corporates
and institutions. So, those are the settlements in which we are now seeing a good use of our capital if we deploy
there because profitability is relatively poor because the competition is extremely strong, yeah.

Marta Sánchez Romero Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is a follow-up on capital. Do you
expect the implementation of calendar provisions in all the NPLs to have a negative impact on capital by the end
of 2020?
And the second one is in the UK. You seem to be committing more capital again in this market. We've seen a 2%
growth in the quarter in mortgages, is this something that will continue? Is this a bit of seasonality one-offs? Have
your views on the market generally changed because it looked like you were withdrawing from this market and
now you're committing more capital? And does your guidance on net interest income in the UK incorporate any
potential interest rate cuts? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, we already have begun in 2019, even at the end of 2018 to manage really our capital on a group basis, not
just by countries but by segments. And the return on capital of UK mortgages actually is attractive, and that's the
reason we're growing on mortgages. And so, I'd say that it's consistent with the deployment of capital. But it's also
consistent with the fact that we have a great business and franchise in the UK, and this is – we've grown about €7
billion in mortgages in the year, but we've also grown very well, for example on the business side, the business
123 account has grown really well. So, it's consistent with the discipline in capital allocation across the UK and
across the group.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
In terms of the provisions, NPL for next year, I mean, I mentioned some slight – the answer is no, but there will be
some regulatory effects, and it's difficult to know is this going to be a net zero, it's going to slightly positive, slightly
negative, but we're ready for that.
As I said, we can manage our balance sheet actively, maybe not every quarter as we've seen over the last few
years, but every single year for the last five years, we've delivered the 40 basis points and this year again 35
basis points with very strong generation organically as you've seen.

Fernando Gil De Santivanes Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My question on Spain. So, I understood that you aimed to
continue improving the NPL ratio and the coverage ratio going forward, but I just want to clarify on that. And the
second question would be in the UK, what is the actual balance of the SVR book and what is the impact on that in
the NII? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, I'll answer the UK. I know better than to answer Spain. So, SVR balances will come down much less next
year. I think this year, it came down by about €4 billion and next year will be coming down less than that, I think
somewhere between €2 billion to €3 billion. So, you'll have a lot less impact next year. Again, what we are
working very hard is also on the efficiency side and ensuring we're doing more and more mortgages online with a
much better return in terms of efficiency. I think that is the answer on SVR. NPLs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, NPL ratio, I already elaborate on this. I said that I expect the NPL ratio to keep going down significantly in
Spain. The coverage ratio, you mentioned, depends more on the kind of collateralized or non-collateralized loans
that we have. But normally, and it should happen the same in 2020, the collateralized loan tend to stay longer in
the balance sheet than non-collateralized loans. So very likely, the coverage will remain flat or slightly down
depending on if the NPLs are collateralized or not. That is the main factor returning the coverage ratio. You have
recovered value or you don't have recovered value. Plenty of the NPLs that we inherit from Popular comes from
the SME segment and while those tend to be lower collateralized naturally than the mortgages. And for that
reason, this is what drives the coverage ratios more than a specific policy. [ph] Supply in IFRS 9 suspected
(1:15:58) loss taking into account collateralization of the NPLs, yeah.

Sofie Peterzéns Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah, hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. So I wanted just to follow up on the Core Equity Tier 1. Of the 35 basis
point improvement that we saw quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, is there anything that could potentially
reverse in coming quarters that we should be aware of? And then the second question would be how should we
think about your dividend per share going forward, buybacks, M&A? Should we expect the dividend per share to
remain stable around €0.23? Or do you have the intentions to grow that? And my last question would be on CECL
in the US. Did you see any big impact from the new provisioning requirements in the US? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A

It's in local accounting...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...it's local accounting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A

...local accounting, it's not group accounting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. And it's been reported by Santander Consumer. I believe it's about €2 billion, something like this impact. I
think that has been informed already in Q3, so there's nothing new there and, again, no impact on the group.
In terms of dividend, so, what we are focusing very much is on the cash dividend per share. Our intention is to get
rid of the scrip but it's also important to consider our retail shareholders and, again, that's what we said. Again,
because it's difficult to predict everything that's going to happen during the year, our aim is to, first, 40% to 50%
on the underlying results; second, that the cash dividend per share should be as much as possible aligned with
the underlying growth in our profits and I think that is what we're doing this year.
If we look at underlying profit growth, it's around 3% and that's what we are proposing in terms of the increase in
the cash dividend per share. Total dividend will stay stable, so the scrip is reduced. It's now only 13%. So, again,
we've returned to shareholders over these five years €18 billion, which shows the confidence of management and
the board in the sustainability of our results. And this is something which we expect to be, hopefully, reflected
soon also in the market. So, this is the policy. We are not changing that. It's stable and we'll be proposing this to
the shareholders in April.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
There is nothing – in the quarter, there is some negative regulatory headwinds which we're actually anticipating
for next year because we have information on that. So, at 9 basis points, I believe. There's more securitizations
and less growth in risk-weighted assets than in other quarters.
But again, it's a bit of a seasonal impact in that sense, less growth, but also more securitizations happening in the
fourth quarter. You're going to get volatility inter-quarterly that's for sure. We have some acquisitions coming in.
We also have some divestments. And the timing of that per quarter is difficult to calculate. Again, what is
important is management and the board's confidence that at 11.65%, the level and the buffers against regulatory
requirements are very comfortable.
And by the way, the future – because Basel IV and what happens ahead, I think that the very important signal is
we're able to deliver profitability growth and we're able to manage our balance sheet to accommodate this kind of
instances like we had this year with 60 basis points which we don't anticipate to be, obviously, anywhere near
those levels for the next three years.

Stefan R. Nedialkov Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hi, guys. Good morning. It's Stefan from Citi. A couple of questions on my side, I try not to beat a dead horse
here, but you did mention strategic flexibility on capital when you get closer to 12% CET1. Just wanted to get
more color on what do you mean by strategic? Do you mean M&A or do you mean just generally being able to
face organic growth opportunities, regulatory challenges, et cetera. So, is it M&A that you meant or non-M&A?
And the second question is on the divisions. Mexican fees seem to be down. Mexican loan growth, half of the
yearly growth seem to be bunched up in 4Q. Yes, that is seasonal, but still big skew towards 4Q. What's going on
there? It looks like it's corporate and government lending. Any color for 2020 would be good as well.
And in another division in the US, the cost of deposits seems to be going up quite a bit, while loan repricing is
down, obviously, because of lower rates. How should we think about these quite different dynamics? Why are
deposits going up so much in terms of cost? Thank you.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yes. In terms of what happens when we don't have to accumulate more capital, I mean strategic flexibility means
we can choose to either increase dividends faster. We can buy back shares, of course, but very importantly, we
have a lot of opportunities for profitable growth. So, we will have to find a balance between these options. There is
no plans for M&A.
We've always said M&A would be very disciplined. We – in our core markets when there's – and we've done this
in certain places over the last couple of years, we will be very strict in our criteria. We have seen opportunities, we
have not taken those opportunities over the last few years and in a couple of instances we have because it added
to the franchise and the return was accretive after two, three years which is the benchmark which we have set.
I will answer the US and I'll let José Antonio answer on Mexico, but I think the US is very important. So I'd say, on
the US, we have really made exceptional and I mean exceptional progress over the last couple of years. We've
grown profits double-digit in 2018, 2019 and we can guide to again double-digit growth in 2020.
In the US, we have three important blocks. One is the consumer finance. That's a business that has a huge
excess capital but even with that excess capital is at around 13%, 14% return on tangible equity. Second is that
there are very strong links which we are now capitalizing not just within the US but with the group. Just to give you
an example of how we're improving the profitability and we're going to do more of this, 22% – and by the way I
just joined the US board because I want to make sure we understand that better, how the organic growth is
possible – 22% of the originations in 2019 of Santander Consumer were prime auto loans which are on the
balance sheet of SBNA. It's now 10% of the SBNA loans coming from originations at Santander Consumer. This
also improves the profitability of consumer because it's becoming, it already is, a best-in-class servicer, again,
very high return on that business. So – and there are examples – I don't want to take too long, but there are
examples on the mid-corp segment with SBNA in Mexico, SBNA in the UK which is increasingly integrated. We're
investing together in technology also.
The last point I'd like to make on margins and it's possible that the deposit cost might have risen slightly but
what's important is that the year-on-year, in terms of current accounts of our bank and very importantly on the
experience is one of the best in its peer group. And the overall in the region and for the regional banks, the
margins are much more attractive than they are in Europe. So we're trying to bring our knowledge and what we've
learned in terms of managing the business in Europe at much lower margins – to actually all of the Americas. So
we're guiding again to double-digit growth in the US next year and getting to the targets that we announced in
Investor Day, so I hope. The specific on the quarter, honestly, I don't know if Sergio, José Antonio, the deposit
cost in the quarter and SBNA but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, as a matter of fact, who grew faster in relatively high-cost deposits. We are going the other way around. It
depends on the deposit growth, who grew 11% and who grew faster in kind of institutional deposits that are more
expensive, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sergio Gámez Toro A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. We'll follow-up offline, Stefan. But the cost of the deposit of SBNA went down on a quarterly basis is at the
lowest so consistent with the rating in the US, but we'll follow-up if that's okay with you.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A

Yeah. Sorry, just a follow-up. So, I said the building blocks and I just realized I just commented on two of them. So
we have three building blocks. One is Santander Consumer which is well known, very profitable. The other SBNA.
Clearly, there's work to be done. Might I say that for the last few years, we could not do even launching – I mean,
it was very difficult for us to grow even organically because of our regulatory situation. That's changing. Again,
we're going to be able to do more activities, and you should see that coming in in 2021. But there's a third very
profitable block or also which is Wealth Management which is less known. We are very good at this. We're
growing that really well. It's part of the Global Wealth Management and Asset Insurance Division, and we have
€25 billion under management, okay? And that is the third US highly profitable, scalable business which is in the
US, and we'll have increasing connections to SBNA as we go forward and have more flexibility.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
In Mexico – let me elaborate a little bit. In Mexico – Mexico has – in the quarter a number that are mixed by
accounting issues, so, you have gross income growing 3.5% quarter-on-quarter that is a very growth. And you
have some impact coming from the corporate business, the Corporate & Investment Banking business that
produce capital gains and reduce the net interest income. And it's a translation from one line to another. If you
look at the gross income, we are growing 3.5% quarter-on-quarter, that is at very healthy rate.
Going forward, we are, as I said in the presentation, optimistic about 2020. Mexico [indiscernible] (1:27:42) grew
in 2019. The economy was basically flat, no growth, and we expect better trends in 2020 and growing the
franchise along these lines. It's true that we – while this market consensus is expecting some slowdown in
reduction into rates that may affect something, but we have plenty of room to reduce our deposit cost. So, overall,
I'm optimistic about our capacity to keep growing revenues in Mexico, yeah.

been a lot of discussion around the quarter here. Could you please explain, is that guidance doesn't change or
you just preferred to keep it more flexible which is kind of what I understood?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
And, secondly on – again, sorry, asset quality in Spain. I'd like to understand your point of view. Santander has
always taking a probably more risk here. You retain a larger stake in the JV that you sold with the nonperforming
assets of Popular. And now you seem to be retaining a larger share of nonperforming assets. You are now having
a NPL ratio substantially above the average in Spain. I want to understand why aren't you taking a more
aggressive approach? Is just because you see more value there or because you are trying to protect capital?
And, lastly, if you could just guide us if you weren't able to – if you decide to do so, could you sell a big block as
your other peers have done in Spain? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Okay. On Basel IV, I would like to say that I and we are very confident that Basel IV can be easily, and let me
stress, easily absorbed whilst maintaining both an attractive dividend policy and financing profitable growth. And
why do I say this because for five years, we have a strong track record, five years of 40 basis points annual
organic capital generation and also we are continuously transforming our model.
Again, 2019, we absorbed 60 basis points, actually 62 basis points, exactly on regulatory impacts. We grew loans
at 4%, we are proposing to increase the cash DPS close to 3%.
The 100 basis points guidance that was given in Q3 was very preliminary and it was incomplete, in the sense that
it was pre mitigation. Beyond 2020, there are, of course, other regulatory impacts at play not just the negative,
but, for example, as I mentioned, the capital treatment of intangibles which would have a net positive for
Santander.
And last but not least, Santander should be lower impact than peers. But, again, let me stress that we, as
management, today have precise tools to manage on a quarterly basis and even more on a yearly basis, our, let's
say, the – our risk weighted assets and how much business we put on the books.
We are working on a originate to distribute model, which we're already implementing. So, we have a much, much
bigger flexibility and that is the high confidence we're giving you on capital. But we're keeping the 11% to 12%
because we believe that is the right target. And, again, because we think 11.65% is a comfortable level and gives
us comfortable buffers. I would say even, and I've said, very comfortable buffers against the regulatory
requirements. I hope that answers the question. And there were two more, which maybe José Antonio can take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. I was – asset quality in Spain. If the question if I understood well, if it was – if we are changing our policy
toward disposing the non-performing loans from non-performing assets. The sure answer is no . We've done
plenty of deals, as you know, we incorporate companies, MERLIN, Metrovacesa landmark in 2019, Quasar, we
dispose [indiscernible] (1:32:22). We continue to analyze our portfolios and to analyze the possibility to dispose in
a market at a price. We're price conscious but you're suggesting that we may be slowing down our disposal of the
portfolios because capital issues, I tell you that is more, we'll continue with the same policy. We are conscious of
the pricing and we'll continue to reduce our NPLs, our non-performing assets, in line with our traditional way of
managing these issues, yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. They're follow-ups on capital. Can you please update us on the pending
regulatory hurdles of 2020 with the split? The guidance was 80 basis points to 90 basis points on the Q3 call.
You've taken over 60 basis points in 2019. Can you just confirm there is 20 basis points to 30 basis points left for
2020?
And also following up on the developments on the regulatory front, the approval of CRD V and in particular of
Article 104a, do you intend to use it? How and when? And what needs to happen for you to use it in your view?
And does the progress of CET1 that you've made, your positive capital outlook, and the more constructive
regulatory environment allow you to implement a more visible dividend policy for the future? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So again, the guidance for 2020 on regulatory effect is we have taken some in Q4 actually because we had a very
strong performance. So we've taken about a third of that. So I think the 20 basis points, 30 basis points could be
more like 10 basis points, 20 basis points next year. But again there some inorganic also, positives and negatives.
Again, we have said we expect to be close to 12% which is the upper end of the range that we set and which
we're not changing that guidance.
In terms of CRD V, my understanding, if this gets approved in January of 2020, we haven't really looked at the –
at what this means so we're not counting on that in our guidance. But, obviously, it could provide flexibility
because you could cover some of the CET1 with Pillar II and the approval is expected in January. That could be
an upside which again we're not counting but could come into force in maybe 2022, 2023 or after that.
And in terms of the dividend policy, well, we believe we have a very clear dividend policy but I'm not sure what
more we can say. We can say that 40 to 50 on an underlying I think I'd mentioned before that the cash DPS, we
would like that it increases. Our aim is that it increases in line with the underlying profit growth. The aim is to
reduce the strip but we believe that for now, the flexibility is good, not because of institutions which we know
you're not that keen but because our retail investors like it and the reason we got to approval to repurchase
shares is that because as the year goes by, to ensure that we do what we commit, we like to have that extra
flexibility.
To be very honest because there's been less visibility on regulatory issues and that gave us some extra flexibility.
But we're reducing that again this year to 13%. So, that is the dividend policy that we have set and approved. And
I think I answered both questions. Thank you.

Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, Caixabank BPI
Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, the first question would actually be on the fees,
particularly in Spain. This quarter wasn't particularly strong. I've seen the explanation regarding investment
banking fees. I was wondering if you could shed some light on how you see it evolving over the next quarters or
over the next years. Basically, this is the line that some of your peers have flagged not particularly a positive
stance on. I was wondering what's your view on that?
Secondly, on NII in Brazil, if you could give us also some views on how you see it evolving? You mentioned that
you're expecting to compensate some of the pressure in margin with volume growth. But I was wondering how do
you see the NII figure itself evolving? But what's the net-net of these two, basically?
And then as a follow-up question on capital, just basically into – in the next years. So, you have this guidance of
12% on the – considering the transitional arrangement of IFRS 16. Could you remind us what will be the impact
from the phasing in of these transitional arrangements in 2020? Thank you very much.

So, there's still – I think there's 19 basis points left on IFRS, that's in – 20 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
23 basis points now and I think up to next year, it will be 18 basis points or 17 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. And that factors – obviously that's factor in on a year-by-year basis. So, 24 basis points, right? So, do you
want to answer the other questions? Thank you.

Well the other question were fees in Spain and how do we see this evolving in coming quarters. We have had
some impacts from CIB businesses here, in the fee income. We've been sharing with you this. Ex-CIB, we have
some translation. We expect lower funding cost that impacts [indiscernible] (1:38:31) you show the changes in
123 account. You can elaborate your numbers. In relation with this, probably positive in NIM. Some negative in
fee income and CIB, well, depends on the year, the activity we see on the year. As you know, we are the market
leader in CIB in Spain and well, how the market evolves affect us significantly.
The second question was NII in Brazil. Well, I said in the presentation that we expect in Brazil with a GDP growing
north of 2%, a healthy growth in volumes and with some margin pressure. Some of those, you already know. The
main one was the cap on overdraft that has a significant impact.
For that reason, we expect some margin pressure. We expect to be in clearly in positive territory in Brazil in net
interest income with pressures coming from regulatory side. The most important one you already know is the cap
on overdraft that went down from 12% to 8% on a monthly basis.

Basically, that's it. We are fairly positive in fee income in Brazil where we expect to keep growing given the market
share gains that we are getting on the level of current seasonality. We are having the insurance payments and
private banking business should support a healthy growth probably into double digit in Brazil in 2020.
