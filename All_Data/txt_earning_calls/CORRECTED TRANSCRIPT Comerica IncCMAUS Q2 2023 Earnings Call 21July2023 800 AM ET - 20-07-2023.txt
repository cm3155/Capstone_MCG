Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $273
million or $2.01 per share. Average loans grew to $55.4 billion and the continued focus on fee income helped
drive our second highest noninterest income quarter in our history. Expenses declined and our disciplined
approach to credit produced a third consecutive quarter of net recovery.
Beyond our compelling financial results, we have launched a transformational expansion and support for small
businesses. In the second quarter, we introduced tailored products designed to improve access to capital and
enhance cash management capabilities for these important customers, while also providing access to valuable
business insights and resources.
Coupled with our recognized SBA achievement, we believe we are well-positioned to be a leading bank for small
business, providing the tools they need to achieve their goals. Our emphasis on supporting small business is an
important part of our overall commitment to communities. You can read more about our other community and
sustainability efforts in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report that was recently published on comerica.com.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Our Southeast and Mountain West expansionary investments continue to perform well, as our bankers were
active in the market, adding new relationships and building the pipeline. Strong relative economic trends in these
regions, coupled with the prevalence of target customer base, could create opportunity for continued growth over
time.
Moving to a summary of our results on slide 4, average loans grew $1.9 billion. Average deposits decreased $3.5
billion due to customer diversification efforts related to industry disruption in the first quarter and the ongoing
impact of Fed monetary actions. We saw increased stabilization in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits in the second half of the quarter, and we believe diversification efforts are largely behind us.
As we expected, net interest income declined as we saw the full impact of first quarter deposit flows and funding
activity. Credit quality outperformed with another quarter of net recoveries, and our criticized loan percentage
remained below our historical average. Noninterest income was near record levels and expenses declined.
Profitability improved [indiscernible] (00:04:27) capital position, as we generated an estimated CET1 ratio of
10.31%, above our strategic target. In all, it was a strong quarter for Comerica.
And I will now turn the call over to Jim, who will review our results in more detail.

James J. Herzog
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, loan growth came in just above expectations, as
average balances increased 4% from the first quarter. Increased selectivity drove a slight decline in commitments,
and utilization increased almost 1%, but remained below historical averages.
Growth in our Commercial Real Estate business of over $520 million continued to be driven largely by
construction of multi-family and industrial projects originated over the last two years, in addition to the slower pace
of payoffs. Recent origination activity and pipeline have significantly declined.
Our Commercial Real Estate strategy remains highly selective, with a focus on Class A projects, and our office
exposure is intentionally limited. Large corporate loans grew $447 million, as we won new customer relationships
and financed acquisitions for existing customers. National Dealer Services benefited from new customer
acquisition, and while floor plan inventories continue to grow, they remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Typical second quarter seasonality resulted in a $325 million increase in average Mortgage Banker Finance
loans. However, consistent with our strategic exit of that business, we expect most of our Mortgage Banker
balances to be paid off by the end of 2023.
Slide 6 provides an overview of our deposit activity for the quarter. Average deposit balances declined 5%, in line
with expectations. Conversations pivoted away from banking industry stability, as customers refocused on
broader macroeconomic issues such as risk of recession and elevated rates. Throughout the quarter, customer
deposit balances continued to normalize, and we observed relatively stable trends since mid-May. Industry
funding pressures drove deposit competition, and interest-bearing deposit costs increased to 237 basis points.
However, we feel our dynamic pricing strategy and relationship approach allowed us to maintain our forecasted
deposit betas and protect balances.
While the rate environment further pressured noninterest-bearing deposits, we continue to view our deposit mix
as a competitive advantage, providing a more stable and cost-effective funding source than our peers. With
strategic investments underway to enhance payments and other treasury management products, in addition to

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
our national small business banking strategy, we see opportunities to further improve our attractive deposit profile
over time.
As shown on slide 7, our strong liquidity position provided flexibility. We maintained excess cash, repaid maturing
FHLB advances, and our remaining liquidity capacity increased. Our quarter-end loan-to-deposit ratio was 84%,
still below our 15-year average, and strategic actions announced in the second quarter are expected to keep that
ratio in the mid-80s at year-end 2023.
Cash balances at the holding company position us to repay our $850 million debt due this summer, and very light
remaining unsecured funding maturities create flexibility to manage funding needs and cash levels over time.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on slide 8 declined almost $900 million, with paydowns, maturities,
and a $212 million negative mark-to-market adjustment. Our securities strategy remains unchanged as we start
reinvesting in the third quarter of 2022 and we maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale, providing full
transparency and management flexibility.
Although we have modest treasury maturities through the end of the year, larger scheduled repayments in 2024
and 2025 are projected to benefit liquidity, profitability, and our unrealized losses within AOCI. Altogether, we
expect a 34% improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years. As our portfolio is pledged to
enhance our liquidity position, we do not anticipate any need to sell securities, and therefore unrealized losses
should not impact income.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income decreased $87 million to $621 million, in line with expectations, as the
benefit of loan volume and one more day were offset by the impact of wholesale funding, lower deposit balances,
a shift in deposit mix, and deposit pricing. A significant portion of the funding and deposit activity occurred late in
the first quarter, so results reflect a full quarter impact of those actions. With our strategic management of our
asset sensitivity position, the impact of rates was nominal.
As shown on slide 10, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the current composition of our
balance sheet favorably position us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual 100 basis points, or 50 basis
points on average, decline in interest rates. By strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios, while
considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to maintain our insulated position over time. Our proven discipline
produced another quarter of excellent credit quality, as highlighted on slide 11. Once again, we posted net
recoveries, although we do not project this trend to continue.
Modest migration drove an increase in criticized loans. However, at under 4% of total loans, they remain well
below historical averages. Nonaccrual loans declined and inflows to not accruals remained low at $17 million.
Migration, loan growth and a continued weak economic outlook drove the $33 million provision expense, and the
allowance for credit losses increased to 1.31%. Given the environment, we increased oversight in portfolios with
greater relative exposure to elevated rates such as leveraged loans in our Commercial Real Estate business.
However, we remain very comfortable with these portfolio metrics and expect continued migration to be
manageable.
Noninterest income on slide 12 continued to outperform, growing $21 million from an already strong first quarter.
Non-customer income contributed to results with increases in FHLB dividends and BOLI, in addition to customer-
related growth in fiduciary and card. Although not shown as a variance to prior quarter, capital markets exceeded
expectations as we repeated strong first quarter results. Risk management income related to our hedging strategy
saw a modest decrease and should continue to vary based on the rate environment. While non-customer income

can be hard to predict, we expect our strategic investments in products and services to drive further growth in
capital efficiency income over time. We remain excited about the results of these efforts to-date.
Expenses on slide 13 declined $16 million, in line with expectations. Quarter-over-quarter expenses benefited
from several large first quarter items that did not recur, netting $2 million related to the Ameriprise transition, a
favorable state tax refund and a real estate asset write-down. Seasonally lower salaries and benefits expense and
other noninterest expenses were partially offset by increased outside processing, FDIC insurance and software
costs.
Modernization efforts remained on track as we incurred a total of $7 million in expenses advancing our wealth
management, corporate facilities, technology and retail strategies. We continue to selectively prioritize strategic
investments designed to further enhance our financial results while remaining committed to prudently managing
expenses commensurate with our earnings power.
Slide 14 highlights our strong capital position. With share buybacks paused, capital generation from profitability
outpaced loan growth, driving our estimated CET1 further above our target to 10.31%. Strategic actions, including
the exit of Mortgage Banker Finance and increased selectivity across the rest of the portfolio, are expected to
elevate capital ratios through the end of this year.
Higher rates increased unrealized losses in our securities and swap portfolios, reducing our tangible common
equity ratio to 5.06%. Adjusting for the impact of AOCI, our tangible common equity ratio of would have been
9.22%. Although potential regulatory changes have not yet been proposed, considering our size, portfolio and
projections, we feel very good about our ability to support our customers and comply with anticipated capital
requirements.
Our outlook for 2023 is on slide 15 and assumes no significant change in the economic environment. We continue
to project full year 2023 average loan growth of 8%. The strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance and increased
selectivity is expected to keep loan balances relatively flat into the third quarter. Our projected full year average
deposit decline of 14% to 15% is attributable to quantitative tightening that began last year and the impact of the
first quarter 2023 industry events. Assuming continued normalization of deposit trends and additional FOMC
actions, we expect only a modest deposit decline through the second half of the year.
We expect our highest year of net interest income in 2023, growing 1% to 2% over last year's record results.
Although we anticipate short-term rates will remain high through the remainder of the year, our asset sensitivity
position is designed to protect our strong profitability by minimizing the negative impact of rates when they
decline. Credit quality remained excellent, and we expect continued migration to remain manageable. Given the
strong performance through the first two quarters, we forecast full year 2023 net charge-offs to remain below our
normal 20 to 40 basis points range.
Noninterest income exceeded expectations for the first half of the year, and we expect full year to grow 7% to 9%
over 2022. Benefits from non-customer income related to FHLB dividends and risk management income are
expected to continue, but likely at declining rates as we repay maturing advances and rates normalize. While we
expect strong foreign exchange income and derivative income, we anticipate levels to moderate from the
incredible performance to-date.
Even with potential headwinds in the second half of the year relative to the first half, the overall noninterest
income run rate remains compelling. Noninterest expenses are expected to increase approximately 9% year-over-
year, and 3% of that growth is the result of higher pension expense for 2023. Talent acquisition, investments

benefiting our deposit strategy, and the enhanced regulatory and compliance focus given our size and business
model are expected to create some expense pressure compared to prior guidance.
As we look into the third quarter, the cost of filling open positions and other expenses pressure should largely be
offset by an expected credit to modernization expense driven by corporate facilities, although the precise timing
for this type of credit can be challenging to predict. Prudent expense management remains a priority as we
balance expense pressures with the need to invest for the future. Strong profitability is expected to further grow
our capital position in excess of our target, and we believe that trend will continue until we resume share
repurchases.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Thank you, Jim. Slide 16 summarizes our competitive advantage. With the local delivery of sophisticated,
comprehensive product and industry expertise by tenured bankers, we feel we encapsulate the best features of
the largest and smallest competitors. Diversification remains an important tenet of our core strategy and exporting
our business model to expansion markets has further enhanced our attractive geographic profile.
By accelerating certain investments already underway such as payments, small business, wealth management
and capital markets, we are elevating the products and capabilities tailored to meet our customers' needs, while
enhancing our funding profile, revenue mix and overall return on capital. Optimizing our portfolio through the
strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance and increasing selectivity across the rest of our business lines
prioritizes capital and funding for our target customers.
Throughout our 174-year history, we have successfully navigated a number of economic events, and once again,
our business model was tested and proved to be sound. As a leading bank for business with strong retail and
wealth management capability, we play a unique role supporting our customers as a trusted long-term banking
partner.
Thanks for your time this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take some questions.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please
go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Good morning. On the deposit growth outlook, I know you lowered your deposit growth
expectation despite the end of period deposits actually increasing and coming in a little bit better than expected. I
know you indicated you expect only a modest deposit decline in the back half. Can you maybe just give us some
of the color around the rationale for the lowered growth expectation and what type of trends that you expect to
develop as you look at the back half? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, John. It's Jim. Thanks for the question. Yeah, the relatively stable or modest decrease was
relative to the second quarter average of $64 billion. We do expect to stay very close to that on average through
the end of the year. There are some dynamics turning on below that. Core deposits will probably take a small
step-down from the average of Q2 just because in the first half of the second quarter, we did have just some very
modest runoff. But then, again, we added some brokered deposits also that roughly offset that during the quarter.
That on an average basis will carry through.
And so, we do think, by the end of the year, we'll still be hovering around that $63 billion to $64 billion number. We
were a little bit elevated on 6/30, as you see in the bar on the right. And so, I would not expect all of those
balances to stick around. We had $800 million of card that was elevated relative to its typical average, and then
we did have some elevated customer balances on 6/30 that I would not expect to stick around either. So, that is a
little bit of an inflated number. I would maybe stick more to the average guidance of gravitating down to $63 billion
to $64 billion by the end of the year on average.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then separately, also on the deposit front, in terms of the noninterest-
bearing mix, I know it's 48% current. Where do you see that bottoming? Already, I think you're at your pre-
pandemic level. You were running at around 48% of the total deposit. So where do you think that could bottom?
And then separately, sorry if I missed it, but if you can give us your updated through-cycle deposit beta
expectation. I believe you were thinking mid-50s and you're currently at 47% now. Thanks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Yes. We are, on average, as well as June 30, hovering in that 47% to 48% area. It's consistent with what I said
early in June in a major investor conference. We still think we are going to dip just slightly below 45%. So think
about maybe 44% to 45%. The average ratio was a little bit elevated because it doesn't consider a little bit of the
runoff that occurred early in the second quarter. The June 30 ratio of 47% is a little elevated due to the elevated
noninterest-bearing balances that I'd referred to before.
And so I kind of think of us being – on a kind of a spot basis, if you ignore the elevated balances, I really think of
us today as being 45% to 46%, and I see that dipping down to maybe 44% to 45% by the end of the year.
Keep in mind that there are a number of variables involved here. Noninterest-bearing flows will be the most
important variable. But to the extent we're successful in bringing back interest-bearing deposits, that could push
that ratio down, too. And we would, of course, welcome back those interest-bearing deposits.
In terms of the beta question, yeah, we still think we're going to end up on an accumulated basis in the mid-50s. I
mean, right now, I have 56% implied in the guidance, but pretty consistent with what we've been saying for the
last few months. So, we're still right around that mid-50% area.

Good morning, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, everyone. Jim, I just want to drill down on your answer to John's question. So, the stability or modest decline
in deposits through the rest of the year, you're saying that's coming from outflows slowing. It's not – because you
had strong outflows this quarter, but you plugged the hole with brokered deposits. So you're not saying you need
to use brokered for the second half to remain fairly stable, down a bit as outflows are slowing, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. To be clear, we have really no plans to add brokered deposits between now and the end of the year. I
think we're at a pretty good resting spot. We do think the customer core deposits have very much stabilized. We
do see – whether we define it by what we were in the second quarter average, or if you look at June 30 with some
elevated balances and you normalize for that number for those elevated balances, from there we see just some
very modest decline between now and the end of the year.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Now we have not really factored in a material amount of seasonal deposits, which, in the past, have come in. But
seasonal patterns have gone out the window over the last year. We're not exactly sure what to expect there. So
there could be some opportunity there. But overall, if you adjust that $66 billion on June 30 for card and maybe a
modest amount of elevated balances, we would see just a modest decline from that level on, assuming we don't
get a large inflow of seasonal deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks. And if we think about margin with the outflow of noninterest-bearing, right, replacing those with
basically time deposits, that's really pressured the NIM. So if that was the ninth inning, are we at a bottom for the
NIM right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
If you look at our guidance, Steven, we do have just a little bit more pressure to go there. You see the net interest
income guidance that we imply. We do see a small step-down in Q3 and then a smaller step-down in Q4. Now, as
a partial offset to that, I never like to talk about NIM percentage, because our NIM percentage can bounce around
for reasons that don't correlate with income, whether it'd be the level of securities, whether it'd be the level of cash
that we carry and the reasons for carrying that cash.
If we do see cash balances go down, [ph] at least (00:25:26) that is putting a bit of a drag on the NIM, if they go
down to normal levels, I would see the NIM being very close to where it's at now. You might see another 3 bps or
4 bps downward pressure in the NIM as the deposit mix is roughly offset by the smaller balance sheet as we
deflate for that excess cash.
If we don't reduce cash balances – and my forecast assumes we do – but if we hold at these cash levels that
we're currently at, you could see another 9 bps, 10 bps of NIM. But again, I'm not expecting that at this point. I'm
more focused on getting the cash down as things continue to stabilize. So we're very near the bottom, just maybe
a few bps depending on what we do with our cash position.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah. Thanks. And maybe a final question, I know we're going to get the new capital rules fairly soon, but
you guys have $91 billion of assets. Curt, how do you think about crossing that $100 billion asset threshold
organically? I know this is not a great environment to be, considering M&A transactions. But when you think about
just the capital burden, the cost burden [indiscernible] (00:26:32) potentially, does it make sense to cross that
organically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, this is Curt. I'll take that question. And you're right. We are within a certain range of that $100 billion
mark at around $91 billion in assets. And assuming that with just the organic growth that we would eventually
cross that number, we've been planning now for the last two years and have a little bit more work to do just to be
prepared for whatever regulatory increased oversight going back in to the stress test, capital planning, et cetera, if
we became a Category IV bank.

We think, just through organic growth, that would probably be a few years out. And our view has continued to be
that we're going to focus on doing the right thing for the shareholders, growing the company, growing the assets
of the company, as we have over our 174-year history. And if that means crossing that $100 billion mark, it would
mean crossing that $100 billion mark. But we think that we're trying to think about it from a long-term perspective,
and just trying to be prepared for whatever [ph] cost or (00:27:45) regulatory oversight might be associated with
that, if it is crossing it from an organic perspective.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I guess just following up on Steve's last question on these capital changes, even if you don't
cross $100 billion, what are the changes you expect to make in terms of just balance sheet management, either
loan-to-deposit ratio, liquidity, et cetera, once these rules are out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
You know, the rules – this is Curt, Ebrahim. The most anticipated ruling is really around the treatment of AOCI in
regulatory ratios. And while all the conversation thus far has been focused on banks north of $100 billion, we do
anticipate that there might be some eventual phase in below $100 billion. Nothing official on that right now, but
we're just trying to be prepared if that comes to pass. If you look at sort of where we are from a CET1 perspective
at 10.31%, if you factor in AOCI, we would be slightly south of 7%, like 6.93%.
And so, we would have a little bit of work to do to raise capital. But we believe it would be phased in, and just
through normal earnings of the company, we could get back to an appropriate CET1 level. We do not believe that
we'd have to go to the external market to raise capital to get back to that level. So, we think we're well-positioned
with whatever ruling might come out. And again, given that we're below the $100 billion mark, we think we would
have some more time if it got applied to banks below that level.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I believe, Ebrahim, you're asking about the stabilization of the loan-to-deposit ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We do expect to stay in the mid-80s – or we do think it was again just slightly elevated on June 30. But we
do have a plan to stay in the mid-80s, and certainly some of the asset optimization things we're doing will help
ensure of that. So, we're right around that area that we're comfortable in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
And it also is below our sort of historical averages as well where we've normally operated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just one separate question, if I may. Given your customer base, give us a sense of your outlook
in terms of credit, health of the customer. There's not a lot of like corporate bonds that have yet repriced to the
higher rates over the last 12 months. What's your expectation in terms of the next year and the likelihood of a
recession, soft landing, et cetera?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Ebrahim, this is Melinda.

Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Obviously, the credit performance continues to be really strong. It was a really nice quarter for us. Obviously, third
quarter of net recoveries, kind of unprecedented. Nonperforming assets, again, modest decline and very low
inflow. But we did see an increase in the criticized category, which is exactly what we've been expecting to see
over the last couple of quarters. The preponderance of the increase that we saw is in our, what I call, core middle-
market C&I portfolio, which would include a number of leveraged loans in that automotive supplier sector.
So, again, we have expected that we would begin to see normalization. It's taken a couple of extra quarters to
actually get there. We've been bouncing around the bottom for a long time. Our current economic forecast that we
use in our CECL process does call for a mild recession. And I think whether it's a mild recession or we end up
with a soft landing, I think we're prepared for a mild recession as it relates to the reserve build, and the reserve
build this quarter really reflects kind of the portfolio growth, as Jim said, as well as that migration. But as of now,

we don't see a lot of loss content, and as Jim guided, we think that for the remainder of this year, we'll be below
that average that we've typically guided.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Melinda, just a follow-up on that one. How do you expect – do you expect more
normalization and how do you generally expect those numbers to progress on criticized?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think we expect that we'll continue to have some migration in the portfolio. There is no doubt that
the – the customer base has been incredibly resilient. Obviously, came into the last couple of years challenges,
very low levered, lots of liquidity, lots of availability. But inflationary pressures over the last 18 months are starting
to show up in the portfolio in terms of pressure around growth in net margin. So, cash flows are a little more
stretched, and I would expect that we'll continue to see some additional migration. I think we're very well reserved
and all of that is taken into sort of the process that we go through each quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, maybe this somewhat ties into it, but maybe to repeat. But you talked about increased selectivity
in lending. Can you talk a little bit more about that, kind of where you've been a little bit more cautious? And then,
the CRE number, it sounds like that was more construction projects funding up. I think you said things are slowing
there, but can you just confirm that?

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think when we talk about it, it's really around, quite candidly, pricing expectations across the loan portfolio,
and we continue to be really selective about it. I've said in the past, we're more focused on sort of credit than we
are maybe trying to earn business on pricing over time. And right now, between those two options, we want to
make sure that we're earning for the company. And so, our selectivity and expectations on pricing, and I think
you're seeing that across the industry just as capital is kind of being contained here, that we're being very careful
about where we deploy it. We're taking care of existing customers. Our expectations on profitability are higher,
relationship are higher.
That's kind of across the portfolio. I think in Commercial Real Estate specifically, we'd actually kind of started
dialing back a little bit on that even in the beginning of this year or maybe end of last year, just starting to be very
careful and taking care of our existing sponsors. We've got great sponsors, and we feel really good about the
portfolio, very limited office exposure, watching what's happening in multi-family. We expect though our projects to
kind of carry Commercial Real Estate balances really into next year. So, we feel good about it, where we are. We
feel good about it from a credit standpoint, our sponsor standpoint. But our expectations on pricing have definitely
gone up this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. Thank you for that. And then, just one for you, Ralph (sic) [Curt] (00:35:23), maybe kind of an odd
question, but you've dealt with COVID, you've dealt with the funding crisis as CEO. So, it's been a hell of a run for
you. But do you feel like it's largely business as usual for Comerica right now or are you still fighting some of
these questions from depositors and this funding crisis that's happened over the last four months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
And he's doing great and remains very engaged...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. I was asking you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
... [indiscernible] (00:36:13) just a minute about the comment to your question that you asked me. The last 30 to
60 days, a number of us have been out in the markets visiting with both employees in town hall formats, but also
with customers in Michigan, California, the Carolinas, Texas, Florida, et cetera. And I would say the conversations
really have shifted for the most part back to more business as usual, as you would refer to it. I mean, customers
are asking us about things that customers normally ask us about, the economy, about interest rates, about
availability to capital and credit, what we're seeing in terms of M&A activity in various industries, et cetera,
industry outlooks.
And so, I feel like that things have definitely stabilized in terms of customer communication and customer
conversations. And we're focused, as Peter said, on taking care of our existing customers. And that's something
that I think we do very well. We've got really great long-standing relationships. And I might just remind you and the
other listeners that right throughout the crisis, we did not lose customers. We saw some customers diversify our
deposits, and we hope over time and seeing some signs – early signs of that, that customers will bring some of
those deposits back [indiscernible] (00:37:47) moved out.
As you alluded to earlier, it has been an interesting time. I became the CEO in April of 2019, and you know all the
events that have occurred since then. But I think our company is so resilient to manage through 174 years of all
the disruptions that have occurred in the economy in the world during that time. And we just do, I think, a great job
of rallying together. And it really pretty much is business as usual.
I referred to, in my comments earlier, a lot of the things that we're focused on and we remain focused on those
beyond just taking care of our employees and our customers, expanding into new markets, focusing on product
capabilities, focusing on small business, growing the Commercial Bank, growing Wealth Management, growing
the Retail Bank. And we feel like the future for us remains very bright as an organization.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brody Preston from UBS. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hello, Brody. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, everyone. Hey, I just wanted to – I wanted to ask on the Tech and Life Sciences deposits, I
noticed that those continue to move down a little bit. But it looked like the rate of change kind of slowed there. I
was wondering kind of what drove that decline, if it's kind of back to normal cash burn for those clients. And kind
of what the – I guess, is there a growth outlook kind of for that business line, now that there's been this disruption
with the largest competitor there no longer or failing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Brody. This is Peter. Yeah. The decline in deposits in TLS, we really started actually seeing that back middle
of last year. So I think that cash started being consumed in that space with all the things that you've kind of seen
happening with tech. I think what happened earlier this year probably accelerated that a little bit further.
But as far as where we go from here, we're being very cautious about our relationships. We're watching what's
going on in the VC community, raising capital, NewCos that are being formed. We've been in that business a
long, long time. We plan to stay in it. We're looking at – we're very careful about where we're adding people,
where we're adding relationships.
And so, I think that we will be in the business. I think, probably at some point, you're going to – you'll start to see
cash build again across the industry and certainly at Comerica. I don't know that it's necessarily in the next six
months. I think we've probably got a little more cash burn going on in this space.
That said, we are bringing on new relationships, and as I said, we're adding people. We feel really good about the
industry and the opportunity over the long term. But we probably got some time to go here of cash burn. And I
think a number of these companies are going to need to raise some capital, and we'll see what happens in the
industry going forward.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then I was hoping just within the AOCI walk, if you could give us some indication as to what the
conditional prepayment rate you're assuming within your effective duration calculation is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Brody, it's Jim. I mean, that prepayment rate varies somewhat widely depending on the type of security. Of
course, we have some bullets in there on the commercial side that generally don't have much in the way of
prepayment. And then we have a number of various tranches of MBS securities that have some variance to them.
So I don't think there's any one number that would likely answer your question, but we certainly have prepayment
rates factored into that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Is it reflective of kind of what the market is bearing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, Jim?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. That's something we prudently do every quarter is monitor the market prepayment rate. So,
very much in line with the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Great. And then I wanted to ask just on the fixed rate loan portfolio, the portion of the portfolio that's fixed
rate, more purely fixed rate, not so much the swap portion. I wanted to get a sense for kind of what the quarterly
repricing cadence looks like on that and kind of what the existing yield on that book is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. That book is a relatively small part of our portfolio, less than 8% of our loans. It does yield well below our
current portfolio. We haven't disclosed the exact rate. But I would say it is materially blown, which isn't surprising
given how fast interest rates have gone up. Contractual life on that is about eight years. So, remaining life would
be about four years. We do see it amortizing along a pretty straight line path amongst that four-year remaining
life.
And we see the – I would say that fixed rate portfolio price is up probably 15 bps a quarter. We kind of parlay that
along its percentage of the overall loan book. You're looking at maybe [indiscernible] (00:43:18) of loan yields
going up because of the repricing in the fixed rate book. So that will be a very small tailwind for us. But it just
depends on where the curve goes, where they're repriced at, and how prepayment patterns kind of follow through
there.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
It's really one of the strengths of our model is the floating rate. Most of our loans are floating rate across our
portfolio. So, we're able to benefit on the actual loan book when the interest rates are going up like this, to your
question there, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. And it gives us a lot more control, too, because we can more synthetically manage our asset/liability
position as opposed to being at the mercy of prepayment rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then last one for me, I just was hoping for a reminder. On the swaps, the yield that you disclosed, the
2.38% for this year, the 2.50% for next year, are those just the received fixed rate or is that a net rate? And if it is
just the received fixed, do you happen to have a sense for what the current kind of pay floating rate is on those
swaps?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. These are fixed received rates, and the pay floating is pretty much aligned with LIBOR – 30-day LIBOR
previously as the quarter progressed, as well as a combination of monthly SOFR and BSBY. Of course, LIBOR is
behind us now, but pretty much aligns with monthly SOFR, monthly BSBY. So that obviously is changing as the
Federal Reserve makes its changes and so on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Is there any spread there over that rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, you know that BSBY, SOFR, depending on where we're at with the FOMC increase coming up
here, obviously, you're looking at kind of a pay rate in the 5%, 5.25% range. So, that would give you the spread
relative to this yield that you see here, the received rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you very much for taking the questions. I appreciate it.

Manan, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the earlier line of questioning on deposit balances. So, you
noted that deposits have stabilized. And if I look at your last update at our conference in June to the end of the
quarter, NIB has actually improved quite nicely even if I strip out the card-related deposits that you mentioned. So,
can you talk about what drove that and what made June just such a strong month? I know you said the
conversations have moved back to business as usual. But maybe you can expand on what changed in those
conversations in the last three weeks of June for deposit customers specifically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I would say – Manan, it's Jim – really nothing changed. We're very much on the trajectory that we had
forecasted. And as I mentioned, beyond card, we did have some elevated customer balances on the noninterest-
bearing side really in the last few days of the month that are no longer with us. Depending on how you think about
how often those types of balances come back, we're anywhere from another $0.5 billion to $1 billion elevated at
the end of the month. But again, we often get these types of deposits too. So, I don't want to fully discount them.
But it is important to understand we were a little bit elevated on June 30.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I might just – this is Curt, Manan – just add what I'd said earlier or expound on what I said earlier. I think
just as things have settled down, the understanding that the concerns were maybe overplayed for the whole
industry and customers are back just to more business as usual. They're talking to us about credit and fee income
products and services and how we can take advantage – or support them from an advisory standpoint. But I think
just getting the banking crisis out of the media and just the noise that was associated with those first couple of
months dying down has really, I think, shifted the conversation quite a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then, just separately, I realized the FDIC special assessment hasn't been finalized. But I
was wondering, once it's finalized, does that come out all in one quarter where there's a reserve or does it come
out over the course of the two years as the proposal suggests?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, we're still waiting, of course, for the rule to be finalized. And there's been a lot of input provided there. So,
we really don't know where it's going to end up. I mean, I think the best speculation is, from a cash basis, we
would probably pay it once the rule is established. But it would be recognized on an expense basis, and therefore,
its impact to capital over a couple of years. But there are a number of variables at play there in terms of all the
input being provided. So, I think we just have to wait and see what the final rule has in it.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Good morning. I was wondering, with deposit closer to stabilization or the outflow slowing, net
interest margin nearing a bottom, do you think net interest income could stabilize in 2024 relative to the fourth
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
We think it's getting very close with the betas. Based on where the curve was on June 30, we think betas will
probably stop rising once you get to around December-January. But of course, you'd have the full quarter effect of
that probably dipping a little bit into 2024. We're bringing loan balances down throughout the year. Most of that
loan balance drop will occur in the fourth quarter. So, you could get a full quarter average of that kind of tripping
into the first quarter of 2024 also.
So, just because of those quarter-to-quarter bleed-ins, I don't know that it'll be 100% stabilized in Q1 of next year,
but I do think it'll stabilize if not Q1, probably in Q2. There are some other variables going on in terms of how
pricing plays out in the industry. That could be a potential tailwind. But yeah, I think as we cross over the year,
you're very close to a bottom there, and I would say by Q2, we're probably at an inflection point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, obviously, there's a lot going on, on the expense side, that non-recurring between
the pensions, the modernization. Can you just remind us what a normal expense growth rate is and is that more
likely next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
We typically – putting aside some abnormal ebbs and flows like those things relating to pension, I mean, we
typically think of expenses as being in the 5% range in terms of what we shoot for. But that's going to vary from
year-to-year depending on what pressure is around us. Things like FDIC can make a difference as that can be
elevated for a year or two at a time. Again, pension can be a big factor. So, I don't think any one year is ever
going to exactly be the average. But over the cycle, I kind of think about it as probably 4.5% to 5%.

Hey. Good morning, Jim. Quick question on the rate outlook. Obviously, the market expects one next week. But if
we stay in a higher for longer for the rest of the year, and next year, you get the forward curve, you get a couple of
cuts, could you talk about how you think your balance sheet will respond in terms of margin performance, given all
the hedges you put on? Thanks.

James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We're pretty neutral right now, Chris, in terms of our interest rate positioning. So, we don't think it would be
an impact regardless of what the Fed does. We are just the slightest bit to the downside for both an up and down
rate scenario. I would say the longer the Fed holds rates at a high level, I do think that's probably – puts a little
more pressure than less pressure on our projections, because I do think you have the potential for a very, very
slow bleed if they're kept high for a very extended period of time in terms of betas and deposit flows. I don't think
it's material. But I don't think it's necessarily helpful to have them elevated for an extended period of time.

Great. And then, my follow-up on capital. I'm interested in your thoughts on what would need to happen to return
to a buyback. Obviously, we know the regulatory is an aspect. But what is it specifically that would be the moment
where you would turn it back on?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Yeah. I would say two things, Chris. One, obviously, stabilization in the overall banking industry. But I think we're
seeing most of it. But I think that we're not, 100% as an industry, out of the woods yet, even though things are
very stable at Comerica. So, certainly stability there would be good. And then, obviously, once we understand –
receive and understand the new capital rules, as soon as we can get comfortable – and we are comfortable right
now. But we'll wait and see how comfortable we are once the rules come out. Once we have some degree of
certainty that we can hit our targets based on the new rules, I think that would put us in a position to really start
thinking about share buyback.
