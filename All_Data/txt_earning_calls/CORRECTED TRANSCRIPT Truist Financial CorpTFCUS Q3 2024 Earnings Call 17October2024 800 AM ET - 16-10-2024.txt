Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we discuss the third
quarter's results, I'd like to begin with purpose on slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company.
We're dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. It's the foundation for everything we do,
and the belief in this mission has never been more important, given the extraordinary start to the fourth quarter
with two devastating hurricanes. In the days since these storms cut a path through the Southeast, Truist's
humanitarian aid team and hundreds of teammate volunteers have been out in force to help our communities.
I've spent time in recent days with teammates in some of the hardest-hit areas. These teammates are doing just
incredible, heroic work helping their neighbors, distributing critical supplies, and making sure Truist facilities were
open to serve our clients, even as their own lives have been upended. In addition to contributions from the
foundation, we've set up several sites where we've distributed supplies. We've also deployed mobile services for
basic needs like showers and laundry facilities, as well as mobile branches, ATMs, and generators to serve
clients in areas without power. This recovery is going to take time, and we're going to play a significant role in
helping these communities recover and rebuild in the days, weeks, months, and even years to come. They can
count on Truist.
Okay, let's turn to discussing our third-quarter results on slide 5. We've made demonstrable progress on our
strategic priorities during the quarter, and I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid
underlying earnings, improved momentum, and sound asset quality metrics. On a GAAP basis, we reported net
income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share. Adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share,
which excluded a few small, discrete items that Mike will discuss later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our
solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 2.4% on a linked-quarter
basis due to another strong quarter of investment banking and trading income and a full quarter's impact of the
balance sheet reposition we completed during the second quarter.
Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these
efforts, our efficiency ratio improved on both a linked- and like-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses increased by less
than 1% linked quarter and declined for the third consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Expenses are
now projected to decline in 2024 compared to 2023, which is an improvement from our original commitment to
keep expenses flat for the year.
Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable while net charge-offs were better than our expectations. We did
record a $25 million loan loss provision during the quarter specifically related to Hurricane Helene, which Mike will
discuss in more detail later. We also returned $1.2 billion worth of capital to our shareholders through our
common dividend and repurchased a $500 million worth of common stock as part of the $5 billion repurchase
plan our board approved in late June. We anticipate repurchasing another $500 million of our common stock in
the fourth quarter. Our CET1 capital ratio remained relatively stable, leaving us well positioned to grow our
balance sheet and to continue to return significant amount of capital to shareholders.
Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core Consumer & Small Business and
Wholesale Banking businesses. Although average loans declined during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the
underlying momentum in terms of increased loan production, greater wallet share within certain businesses, and
the talent we're attracting to our company, all while continuing to maintain our expense discipline and investing in
important areas like technology and our risk infrastructure. Maintaining this momentum and continuing to execute
against our strategic growth priorities will be key to reaching our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target, which
we also announced during the quarter.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I want to spend a little time reviewing the
positive momentum we're seeing within business segments and within our digital initiatives on slides 6, and 7. In
Consumer & Small Business Banking, I'm encouraged by the momentum as we experienced an increase in loan
production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio, and we continued to acquire new clients and
households through both digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balance remained relatively
stable linked-quarter as growth in other consumer, which includes our specialty consumer lending verticals, was
offset by lower residential mortgage and home equity loans. We did experience a 3% linked-quarter increase in
consumer loan production driven by non-real estate lending, which drove period-end indirect auto and other
consumer balances each higher by 2% on a linked-quarter basis. Importantly, we're not sacrificing our credit
standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remained relatively stable, and new consumer loan
production spreads are accretive to the portfolio.
Although overall deposit growth remains muted, we're continuing to add new clients and households. We opened
nearly 200,000 new digital loan and deposit accounts during the quarter, including over 75,000 new-to-bank
clients through our digital channels, which represents a 35% increase over the third quarter of last year. Net new
checking account growth was once again positive in the third quarter as we grew 40,000 new consumer and
business accounts, bringing our total to 108,000 year-to-date. Not only are we adding new households, but
primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience as we
rolled out more than 130 enhancements to our digital experience during the quarter.
In Wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet
share within certain businesses, and the talent we're attracting to our company. During the quarter, we saw 1%
growth in commercial deposits and a 4% increase in wholesale lending production, which was offset by lower line
utilization and higher pay-downs due in part to greater capital markets activity, which is an area where we have
invested consistently. The third quarter represents the strongest capital markets quarter we've reported since
2021, as investment banking revenues increased 79% year-over-year and 43% year-to-date. We experienced
record quarterly performance in equity capital markets, investment-grade issuance, public finance, and asset
securitization. The growth is tied to our focus on gaining greater mindshare with our clients across our industry
verticals, which has led to an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines.
We're continuing to invest in our wholesale platform as we've made several key new hires this quarter in
commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth, and payments, and plan to add additional
talent in the fourth quarter and beyond. These new teammates complement our great existing teams and have
significant experience, in many cases, from larger institutions and are attracted to our results-oriented culture. As I
mentioned last quarter, we have a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending
segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional businesses. We'll primarily
focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise where we've
gained significant share.
We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the
quarter, we launched several significant enhancements to the Truist One View platform, including the ability for
clients to securely chat directly with treasury management specialists. Enhancing the client experience and
growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on slide 7.
We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 6%, and
digital transactions increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to migrate clients towards
self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 36% year-over-year.

In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital
account openings with balances up significantly over the third quarter of last year. A recently enhanced digital
deposit application experience has helped drive a 49% increase in mobile device applications, which now account
for 72% of total digital applications. These improvements also drove a 500-basis-point linked-quarter increase in
the conversion rate on new digital applications, driving productivity and leading strong digital client satisfaction
scores. We're not only better serving and growing with our clients, but we're also doing that more efficiently.
So, now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results, and I'll come back after that and close us out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a high-level summary, we reported third quarter 2024 GAAP net
income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.97 per
share, which included a $36 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per share after-tax increase to the gain on sale of Truist
Insurance Holdings, and a $16 million pre-tax, or another $0.01 per share after-tax reduction on the FDIC special
assessment. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities that were sold
in the second quarter increased by 2.4% linked quarter due to a 2.2% increase in net interest income and 3.1%
growth in noninterest income, driven primarily by growth in investment banking and trading revenue. Adjusted
expenses increased 0.9% linked quarter, but were down approximately 2.3% on a like-quarter basis, reflecting
lower personnel costs.
Moving on to capital, our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked quarter at 11.6% as current-period earnings
and a smaller balance sheet were offset by the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases
completed during the quarter. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs declined by 3 basis points on a linked-
quarter basis, and our nonperforming loans remained relatively stable both on a like-, and linked-quarter basis.
Next, getting into additional detail, I'll cover loans and leases on slide 9. Average loans decreased $3 billion or 1%
on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker commercial client demand and line utilization, partially offset by
modest growth in consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased by $3.2 billion, or 1.7%, primarily due to
a decline in C&I balances, driven again by lower line utilization and at least in part by greater capital markets
activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans remained relatively stable linked quarter as growth in indirect
auto and Service Finance was offset with lower residential mortgage loans. As Bill mentioned, production
improved in both consumer and wholesale lending, but pay-downs and runoff in certain categories like
commercial and residential real estate will likely result in continued pressure on an average balance basis in the
fourth quarter likely similar to the rate of decline that we experienced in the third quarter.
Moving to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1% sequentially, or $3.7 billion, with
approximately $1.7 billion of the decline due to lowered brokered deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits
decreased 1.4%, and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged versus the second quarter of 2024.
The $1.7 billion decline in average brokered deposits reduced our total and interest-bearing deposit costs by 1
basis point sequentially to 2.08%, and 2.88% respectively. Overall, we expect deposit balances to remain
relatively stable in the fourth quarter.
Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide 12 (sic) [11]. Taxable equivalent net interest
income increased 2.2% linked quarter, or $77 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning we
completed during the second quarter, a reduction in higher-cost wholesale funding, and the impact of one
additional day in the third quarter. These tailwinds were partially offset by the impact of additional receive fixed
interest rate swaps that became effective during the quarter and by lower commercial loan balances. Reported

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
net interest margin increased 10 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.12% due primarily to the securities
repositioning I just mentioned and a reduction in higher-cost wholesale funding.
Returning to noninterest income on slide 12. Adjusted noninterest income increased $45 million or 3.1% relative
to the second quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher other income and higher
investment banking and trading income, which improved $46 million due to higher M&A, equity capital markets,
and investment-grade fees. Adjusted noninterest income increased 11% on a like-quarter basis due to higher
investment banking and trading income and higher service charge on deposit income.
Next, I'll cover noninterest expense on slide 13. GAAP expenses of $2.9 billion decreased $167 million linked
quarter primarily due to lower other expenses as the second quarter included a $150 million charitable donation.
Regulatory costs decreased by $34 million partially due to a $16 million reduction on the FDIC special
assessment, which was recognized in 3Q 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 0.9% sequentially due to
higher professional fees, other, and marketing expense partially offset by lower personnel expense. On a like-
quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined by $67 million or 2.3%, reflecting lower personnel and other expenses.
Now, moving to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality remains stable on both a like- and linked-quarter basis,
reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the
quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 55 basis points due primarily to lower losses in our
CRE portfolio. Our loan loss provision remained relatively stable, linked quarter, and includes a $25 million
provision related to Hurricane Helene. The provision exceeded net charge-offs to the fourth quarter, which, along
with lower loan balances, resulted in a 3 basis point increase in our ALLL ratio to 1.60%. Nonperforming loans as
a percentage of total loans remained relatively stable for the fourth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies
were also flat on a linked-quarter basis. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is
down $232 million linked quarter to 1.5% of total loans.
Our office reserve increased from 9.7% to 10.4%, driven by continued expected stress in the office sector.
Approximately 5.1% of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming compared with 6.3% at June 30.
Approximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably,
approximately 21% of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth
segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall loss is
lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and
well reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio.
Turning to capital on slide 15. Truist's CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked quarter at 11.6% as current-
period earnings were offset by the return of $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders via our common stock dividend
and the repurchase of $500 million of our shares. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, increased
from 9.6% to 9.9%, reflecting a $1.6 billion linked-quarter improvement in AOCI due to the decline in longer-term
interest rates experienced during the quarter. Although we await the final proposal for the Basel III Endgame
rules, we believe that our current strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings
and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders.
I will now review our updated guidance on slide 16. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to
decrease 1.5% from the third quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to
decrease 1.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances and some pressure to
our net interest margin due to the temporary lag in our deposit beta. Our net interest income outlook assumes two
25-basis-point reductions in the federal funds rate over the remainder of 2024; one cut in November and another
cut in December. We expect noninterest income to decline by 2%, driven primarily by lower investment banking

and trading revenue as the third quarter performance was helped by some pull-forward of capital markets activity
from the fourth into the third quarter. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the third quarter are expected to
increase 4% in the third quarter, driven by investments in areas such as talent, our digital platforms, marketing,
and risk infrastructure.
For the full year 2024, consistent with our previous guidance, we expect revenues to be down 0.5% to down 1%,
which reflects our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted
expenses to be slightly lower than 2023 adjusted expenses versus our previous expectation for expenses to
remain approximately flat. In terms of asset quality, we previously expected net charge-offs of about 65 basis
points for full year 2024. We would now expect net charge-offs to be closer to 60 basis points in 2024. As it
relates to buybacks, similar to the third quarter, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases
in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable
equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2024.
I will now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.

William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, Mike. So, in conclusion, I'm really pleased with the progress we've made as a company this
year, and I'm confident that we've got tremendous momentum within our company, with our clients and with our
teammates, as our value proposition has never been stronger. First, we've got an incredible franchise with leading
share in high-growth markets. We've got highly motivated and energized teammates. We have a fulsome set of
specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. Our relative capital advantage is a
differentiating factor that gives us a unique ability to grow our core banking businesses by serving existing and
new clients, invest in our infrastructure, and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form
of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years.
As we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve
our profitability over the medium term. Our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client
and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the
profitability improvement potential we're working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client
relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. The good news is we see multiple paths
and initiatives that, with proper execution, will result in improved performance while we don't have to experiment
with new products or expand into new markets to achieve our goals. We plan to accomplish all of this while
maintaining our expense discipline and focus on generating positive long-term operating leverage while also
continue to invest in talent, technology, and our infrastructure.
Although it's too early to provide specific earnings guidance for 2025, based on the current momentum, the
confidence in our teams and our franchise, where we are in the planning cycle, we do expect to achieve positive
operating leverage next year. Finally, we'll never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we
continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist's future,
especially in light of the success I see every day inside our company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and all
of our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. Again, thank
you for your interest and investment in Truist.
And with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.

Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session?
As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up
in order that we may accommodate as many of you on the call today as possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first
question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, was hoping you could please maybe unpack
the fourth-quarter margin guidance a bit more. For overall NII, I certainly understand the ongoing pressure on
loans, but was hoping you might be able to sort of walk through thoughts on how quickly deposit betas might be
able to catch up to help support or ideally enhance the margin and then just make some top-level thoughts about
the company's overall rate sensitivity at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good morning, Scott. Happy to do that. From a NIM perspective, maybe just to sort of start with the third
quarter and give you the trends into the fourth and maybe even give you a sense for kind of where we go from
there, and I'll link that to the beta, the bulk of the improvement that we saw in the third quarter was really driven by
the repositioning, so the 10 basis points from 3.02% to 3.12%. As you look into the fourth quarter, we mentioned
the temporary beta lag. We do expect two cuts in the fourth. We did see some improvement in the third. You'll
recall we were better by 1 basis point on, call it, an average funds rate that was better by 7 basis points for the
quarter. So, it started at, call it a 15% beta.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that, while we'll accelerate significantly, call it, into the mid, maybe even high
30% from a beta perspective, that'll still lag a touch relative to how quickly the assets are repricing. So, we see
some margin compression there. Maybe it's to the same tune as we guided NII, so call it 1.5% or so of net interest
margin down into the sort of low 3.05%, 3.06% area. We would expect that to catch up very, very early probably
in the first quarter of 2025 and would expect to see the margin stabilize, I'd say, in the first quarter and then begin
to improve as we have further cuts as we get into 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. Perfect. That's great color. And thank you. And then just wanted to ask separately, so you did the really
large balance sheet repositioning earlier this year. I've gotten the impression that that was sort of all you planned
there, but you have so much capital flexibility relative to so many banks out there. Any thoughts on further
opportunities to do so, or is it sort of stand pat on that front?

Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, look, I think you're right. We feel like we took a pretty big swing at this in May; have now fully
realized at least the benefit into the run rate in the third quarter. We do think that our capital position is an
advantage. We're trying to be patient, very focused on growing the business. Bill's talked a lot about the various
initiatives in both of our business segments, where we do think we're going to have an opportunity to grow
footings and leverage capital. Obviously, as that's been a little slower to develop, we're buying back shares at an
elevated level. I think we would expect to continue buying back shares at an elevated level. I think the
repositioning incrementally, I don't think we want to ever put the tool back in the toolbox necessarily, but I think it's
a lower priority for us based on what else we see in front of us.

Bill, you mentioned, with proper execution, deliver on the goals here, the targets that you have, could you help us
understand what do you mean by proper execution? Is that just hitting the goals, or is there a change in how
you're operating that delivers proper execution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Betsy, there's a real strong focus on expanding our relationships with our existing clients. I'm really
pleased with the momentum we've created in the execution. Coming out of the merger, there was a lot of
diversion and a lot of focus on activities of getting clients converted and getting teammates onboarded and all
those type things. And that's just way behind us. And now the team's really focused on executing against our
priorities. We've got a really strong focus and clarity about what we want to accomplish. So, when I say proper
execution, maybe I should better have said continuation of the execution momentum that we've started. And you
see some of that in this quarter. You see increase in primacy rates. You see that continuation of net new. So, all
these things that are demonstrable evidence of the fact that we're continuing to expand and grow our
9

relationships with our clients. So, proper probably ought to be continuation and improved momentum against
existing execution.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then as we're thinking about the positive operating leverage into 2025, how much of that is being
driven by deposit beta lags, catching up here with Fed funds. I mean, is that the major driver of how we're thinking
about operating leverage as we roll into 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, you've got all the factors that come into it. So, first is the momentum of the business that we have. So, take
investment banking. Let's use that as one example, the momentum we have in this quarter, continuing that type of
momentum into next year, as an example. The loan growth activity is going to – I think we're confident it's going to
return. We saw production increases this quarter, particularly on the Consumer side. We saw loan production up
around 3%. We saw real increases in the areas that we can lean into. Think about the things you know about like
Service Finance and Sheffield, so we saw really good momentum there. Increase in production on the Wholesale
side, but the utilization was the lowest this quarter. It's been in the last five quarters, so – but we expect to see
some of that return.
So, we've got some loan dependencies. We've got some executional dependencies, some fee dependencies.
And then as you mentioned, the deposit beta. And I'm really pleased with the team. I mean, Mike and team have
provided really great leadership, working really closely with Kristin and Dontá on the businesses to really be on
top of where we are from deposit betas. And Mike indicated we've already had a little bit of movement. We expect
a little bit of lag, but sort of see that transitioning in the first quarter of next year and then continuing from there.
And then the final factor is the expense side. So, the other side of that is controlling expenses, and hopefully we're
giving good evidence to the fact that we've got a good handle on our expenses. We're going to be down this year
versus last year. And I think we've got a really good capacity to correlate our expense growth with our revenue
growth opportunities. So, it's a lot of things, maybe it's a long answer to a short question, but all of those things I
think have the requisite amount of focus and attention, and we don't have a single dependency. We're going to
manage them all really tightly and really well with a focus on achieving that positive operating leverage.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Morning. My first question is a follow-up, Mike. You mentioned a little bit of guidance on the fourth quarter. As we
think about the trajectory from here and fully appreciate we're not getting specific 2025 color today, as we think
about the structure of your asset side versus your liability side, should we assume that from that 3.05%, 3.06%
level, your assets can start repricing faster than liabilities in 1Q, but then there's a day-count impact on NII that's
negative, or will the assets repricing faster than liabilities go – come later? And to that end, you mentioned the
swaps. If you could give us a little bit more color on the swaps, what the notional active is, what the weighted
receive fixed rate is, so we can factor that into our modeling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure. Good morning, Erika. As it relates to the – I call it just maybe the NIM trajectory, I think you've got it
right. Well, actually, let me say this. So, we do expect in the fourth quarter for the beta to accelerate, I mentioned,
call it, mid/high 30s. We would expect that to continue and essentially catch up in the first quarter. So, at that
point, we would expect to actually have the balance sheet behaving a touch liability sensitive, again, after an
asset-sensitive fourth quarter. And so, really as we move deeper into 2025, again, a lot of variables here, we
would expect the net interest margin to begin to expand a touch, so that's a good guide.
And I think you mentioned day count. I'm glad you brought that up. There are two fewer days in the first quarter.
So, as you think about actual NII dollars, while we might see a more stable earning asset base in the first, we
might see a more stable net interest margin. You might still feel a touch of pressure from the dollars of NII
perspective. I think I got most of your questions, 1A and 1B.
On the swaps, let's see, we did – as you know well, we have two programs that we use to manage our rate
position. We've got our receive fixed program, which we primarily rely on to manage our NII sensitivity and risks
and opportunities, and we have our pay fixed program to manage our asset values, manage our capital volatility
risk in the future, AOCI, etcetera. We did have some activity in the positions during the quarter. We added about
15, give or take, billion dollars of forward starting receivers during the third quarter. That takes notional up into
the, call it, 60-or-so-billion-dollar area. We also added about $5 billion of pay fixed swaps. We added to the
investment portfolio during the quarter as well, so had some accompanied activity there.
In terms of active versus sort of forward starting, we did have – I mentioned in our NII results sort of description,
we had a touch of a headwind in the third versus the second quarter based on about $12 billion of incremental
receive fixed swaps becoming active during the quarter. That was a manageable headwind. As we look at the
fourth quarter, we really don't have much else coming on throughout the course of the year. We will have more
active in 2025, but that's going to come on – frankly, who knows? The curve could change, but based on the
curve that we see today, that's going to come on and actually be less of a headwind each quarter into 2025. Our
receive fixed rate, you asked, Erika, is around 3.40% on that notional.

Got it. And my follow-up question, and thanks for all the detail, is for Bill. Based on what Mike just said, you
should have NII growth next year. If everything is supposed to come true that the market's thinking in terms of
capital market strength in 2025, you'll benefit from that as you did this quarter. If the market is good volatile, as it
could be after an election and a change in administration, that could be good for your wealth management
business as well. So, as we think about Truist on offense and fully appreciate that you're aiming for positive
11

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
operating leverage, are you thinking about your expense base really just more relative to that potential revenue
strength in 2025? In other words, should we think about Truist as Truist on offense rather than, oh, because of
this and that, we have to think about managing expenses because of all the issues with the merger integration?
So, I wanted to get your thoughts there.
And additionally, some longer-term investors have asked me: why will Truist operate in the mid-teens in terms of
ROATCE if their two super regional peers are aiming to earn in the high teens or the mid to high teens? And I
suspect that might be a capital adjustment. I know that's a compound question, but I wanted to get your thoughts
on both. Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the comprehensive questions. I think you've characterized the first part of that question exactly
right in the sense that we are on offense, and you can feel it in our company, you can feel it in the results, you can
see it in the things that we talked about in terms of this third quarter, and you outlined many of those in terms of
momentum. We think about the expense side, and this is the concept that I talked about, our commitment to long-
term operating leverage, is the expenses are correlate to that opportunity. And I think today we've got the
calibration correlated. I think, as you noted, it was sort of uncorrelated as we were coming out of the merger, and
today I think we've got a really good handle on the capacity to invest and win and grow and be on offense and
have those be correlated. Again, you saw good evidence of that in this quarter.
So, there isn't a merger hangover or other activity related to the expenses. We've been investing, we're going to
continue to invest, and we see the results of that in our top line revenue growth and opportunity. So, again, higher
correlated and commitment to have an efficient company. So, we're operating today at a really much stronger
efficiency ratio, so we didn't talk about that. So, this commitment to have positive operating leverage on the
platform of a really efficient company, so let's put that in one category.
And then on the ROATCE side, I think you highlighted sort of the starting point is a little bit different, right,
because of the sale of the insurance business and the creation of a lot of capital. Should we start sort of from a
different framework? I think about it as the speed in increase in terms of return. So, our speed of increase and
return, I think, is unparalleled. So, where we start from our ability to deploy capital, both in growing our business
and returning capital to our shareholders, I think has us the capacity to grow our ROATCE faster than anybody
else. And then once we get to that mid-teens sort of level, then – and our business model starts to reflect more of
what we talked about in the first part of my answer, then I think we sort of catapult from there. But the key is we
have the most ability to grow our return over the medium term. Hope that answers it.

Operator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just the first question, and apologies if I missed it. I think you mentioned pace
of buybacks relative to $0.5 billion this quarter. Should we – is there room or are you thinking about increasing the
pace of those buybacks in the near term if loan growth is muted, or should we assume that the $500 million is
relatively locked in for the next several quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Bill. So, I think we ought to think about it as it's going to stay at an elevated level for some period of
time. We've been very clear that we see opportunities to grow our business, so we're going to make sure that
we've got ample capital to do that and invest in the growth. If we see that as being much longer than sort of our
current view, we have the opportunity to recalibrate or to stay at elevated levels longer or to increase those
elevated levels. But for now, I think – and so we talked about the fourth quarter and how we would enter the first
part of next year, we're entering that with a lot of confidence in the ability to grow our business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just on that, I think you responded slightly to Betsy's question earlier. If you think – from an
outside standpoint, and you mentioned that Truist is now all like done with the overhang with the deal, just remind
us, Bill, when we think about the momentum and growth, where across the businesses do you expect to grow
market share? And do you feel like you're at a point where the bank will stop bleeding market share to smaller or
out-of-market competitors who've been aggressive in terms of hiring across the Southeast? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, let's talk about market share in terms of all of our businesses. So, starting with the investment
banking side, we've increased market share consistently through this year in virtually every discipline. So, on the
margin increase share in every discipline. And then when I think about share, I think about the things that we
talked about in terms of, for example, net new. We've really had a really strong focus on net new growth. So,
when I think about share, it's growing share with clients, so increasing the number of net new clients, and that's
sort of an incredible hallmark. And then when I think about share, it's primacy within our existing client base. So,
are we growing our primacy in terms of our share? And this quarter particularly, both on the Wholesale side in
terms of treasury penetration and on the Consumer side in terms of product penetration, we grew primacy with all
of our clients. So, yes, we have a lot of new clients coming into our markets. I mean, a lot of new competitors
coming into our markets because we have great markets. But our primacy and our net new and our capacity to
serve our clients and grow in our share as we look at the important parts of share, I feel really, really comfortable
with. And that's going to continue. So, that pace is – granted, started slower out of the merger, but now is at a
really good pace, and I expect that to continue.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps A
Head-Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corp.
Hi, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Bill, can we get more meat on the bones for the financial expectations in 2025 and beyond such as the definition
of long term when you talk about operating leverage in 2025, are you talking about more than $1? Give some kind
of level. The term, medium term, when you talk about returns, what year are you thinking? And the reason I ask is
I'm trying to better understand the accountability of management to shareholders. And I've written about this, but
in the third quarter, you lowered the return targets from 2019 when it was low 20s to mid-teens. At the same time,
you granted a special extra leadership bonus award to some executive officers. And that was on top of awards
they already get – PSUs, RSUs, LTIP, annual incentive awards – and for what looks like fixing a problem that
Truist caused, the asset liability management, pre the current CFO.
And then there's the question about morale for those who didn't get the award. I mean, two of the five named
executive officers. I recognize, Bill, you did not get that award, but there's others in the 24-member operating
committee who I assume did not get that. So, aside from the morale and reconciling pay with performance, I'm
just looking at today's slides, and I don't see the word shareholders when you say on the slide that says mission,
on the slide that says why Truist. And you have taken some steps, you restructured the board, the balance sheet,
you reordered the company, you sold TIH, you cut expenses, but still shareholders, the stock's underperformed is
the bottom line. Stock's underperformed over most time frames since you announced the merger. So, again,
that's my big tee-up. Can you give us more detail on financial expectations after the fourth quarter and the key
metrics that you think should drive a higher stock price? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure. Thanks, Mike. And thanks for acknowledging the efforts that have been underway. Let me first say, as it
relates to the deck, every slide's about shareholders. So, I just want to be really, really clear about that.
Everything we do is about shareholders. So, that is all in context. As it relates to the ROTCE specifically, I would
say what we do, we did as reset sort of post the sale of TIH. So, it was appropriate to sort of reset the return post-
TIH because we generate a lot of capital, and we change the construct of our business in terms of return. We
created a significant amount of capital, so that actually lowers the return to create that capital, but as we deploy
that capital, we increase that return. And I think as I said earlier to an answer, I think our capacity to increase that
return is – we're in the best position of anybody because we've got that capital and that capacity to deploy it
quickly, both in our business and as a return to our shareholders. So, we raised it efficiently, and I think we have a
chance to deploy it and return it efficiently.
In terms of the elements that are part of that return, hopefully, those are many things that I've talked about and
focused on things that are critical to expanding relationships with existing clients in markets and places where we
14


Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
already have committed capital and resources. So, these are things that have higher returns and faster paybacks.
So, if you think about our strategy, it's not focused on these long-term paybacks and going to markets and trying
new things. This is about really executing against the opportunities that we have in our existing franchise and
increasing that return faster with higher paybacks. When I talk about medium term, the definition of that is
somewhere in that three-year kind of range, but that also depends on sort of where the economy is and what we
see in terms of growth and what we see in terms of rates. So, that could go faster, that could go slower, but the
key is we'll have momentum against that.
And, again, I think you see that in this quarter. I think you'll continue to see that. We'll use the capital – as an
answer to the earlier question, we'll use the capital as a lever so we can return that capital in many ways to the
shareholders, all of which will increase returns, I think, faster than others are capable of doing. I have tremendous
confidence in our team. Again, I think you see evidence of many of that. And then as it relates to the operating
leverage, we said, let us get into the year a little bit more, let us sort of see where things are coming in terms of
where rates are going and where we see asset growth. But that commitment to positive operating leverage is a
continuous one. So, I think we'll make that transition next year, as I said earlier, and then we'll continue to improve
on that transition year-over-year as the returns improve to the earlier part of my answer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just a follow-up to the incentives for management. I think you changed – I cut off with the page 67 of the
proxy last night. That's what you do if you're a bank analyst for a long time. And I'm just trying – and I also saw the
release that you had this quarter or in third quarter, and it looks like there's like 12 financial metrics and then five
nonfinancial metrics, and there's so many different metrics that driving compensation. If you had to pick one or
two key metrics that we on the outside can monitor and focus on that should drive shareholder value, what should
they be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, appreciate you diving into the proxy. I think as you dive into that proxy, you'll see compensation
based on performance. So, I think you'll see that actually quite clearly. So, don't assume that we don't have that
mentality at this company. And I think the primary measures that we look at are ROTCE and growth in our
business. So, you have to have really good return, and you have to have growth. So, we're looking at total book
value per share plus dividends plus ROTCE. So, total absolute growth and total relative return growth.

Mike Mayo Q

All right, thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
All right. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned about increasing in the fourth quarter
investments related to risk infrastructure. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what that is and the
drivers of, I guess, why now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Matt, that's a continuation of the investments that we have in the risk infrastructure. So, that's
everything you can think of in terms of how we build a more enduring consistent infrastructure. So, think about the
investments in cyber, think about the investments in data, all the type things that go along with that investment.
They're bumpy by quarter, but they are increasing and part of our overall guidance. And so, in the fourth quarter,
we just had some specific items that were more unique to that quarter, but they're also factored into the guidance
that we've given on positive operating leverage for next year. We're going to continue to invest in infrastructure.
This isn't a onetime unusual thing. This is a continuous investment for a company our size with the responsibilities
and the obligations we have to our clients, regulators, and our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And I know when you combined the two companies, you guys made a lot of investments in, call it, the [ph] guts to
(00:52:39) the company, taking the best of both and creating some new platforms. Maybe just, like, give us a
quick snapshot of, like, what is there still to do? Like, is it catching up on something? Is it just kind of business as
usual, staying up-to-date, like all the other banks are doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think in terms of basically the risk infrastructure, I mean, we've seen the elevation of expectations of how
we manage data. We've seen elevated expectations in AI and the investments that we want to make there. We've
seen elevated expectations in terms of cyber. So, there are many more not things that were left out of the merger,
but things that are just continuous improvement of what we want to do and be responsive to the opportunities and
challenges that exist in financial services.

Hi, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys share with us – Bill, in your prepared remarks when you talked about market share in response to a
question, but you were talking about wallet share, how in some of your businesses you're gaining wallet share.
Can you share with us how can we as outsiders measure that success, growing that wallet share? And second,
what are you doing to grow that wallet share that's showing up that maybe you didn't see three or four years ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, the best way to see the wallet share gain is see it in the overall returns of our business. So, if you
think about the return expectations and increasing ROTCE, think about that for us as increasing ROA. Think
about that as the focus. So, we have assets deployed, we have resources deployed, and we increase the
penetration. This time we talked about checking primacy up 1%. We talked about treasury management,
penetration of our commercial base up 1%. So, hopefully we're giving you that kind of information that's consistent
to demonstrate that primacy, but you primarily see it in the returns. So, that's the focus. I mean, that's the big way
we drive returns for this business; is improving our primacy with our clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And following up on that primacy comment, Bill, how do you guys intersect or interlock your pursuit of the digital
channel with primacy? It seems like the industry, you guys included, the optimal kind of mix is having physical
branches as well as the digital channel. Do most of the primacy relationships still come through the brick-and-
mortar, or are you seeing some success in building it through the digital channel?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, you're really on it, and the answer is both. We have this concept called T3, so this concept of that touch and
technology equals trust. So, what we want to do and the capability that we've built, for example, our clients in
Truist Assist, so our digital clients can have a virtual assistant to sort of help them in their transactions, but what
we believe is that they also have the opportunity to then transition to a human interaction with that. So, you've got
to sort of supply both of those opportunities. When a client is interacting with us digitally and shows up in our
branch, we want to be able to follow up on that transaction and continue that process. So, I think they're actually
both really important as part of the overall process. It never becomes more clear in something like we've
experienced in the last few weeks in the storms.
So, those economies go to cash during that particular time. So, our branches and our ATMs are the most
important thing that those communities need at that time. They don't have access to digital, Internet's down,
power's down, so being able to toggle between both of those and making sure that we serve our clients in the way
that they can be best be served. That's why I led with that and this particular commentary is just to show how
important both of those things are because the goal is to create an enduring relationship with a community and
with a client, and we do that by investing in the channels that are most important to them when they're most
important to them.
