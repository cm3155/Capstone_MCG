Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Let me begin on slide 3. 2021
was a transformational year for Huntington. We continue to live our purpose and remain focused on our vision to
become the country's leading People-First, Digitally-Powered bank. We executed on our organic growth initiatives
along with the timely closing of the TCF acquisition. In the fourth quarter, we began by successfully completing
conversion activities, and by the time we exited the quarter, we had refocused our teams on driving growth. We
delivered record new loan production and continued to build on revenue initiatives. We entered 2022 with added
scale, density, new markets and specialty businesses. We are intently focused on driving growth and delivering
top-tier financial performance.
On slide 4, we're pleased to report our excellent fourth quarter results centered on four key areas. First, we
finished 2021 with record full year revenue growth and broad-based loan production. We delivered strong
performance across the board in our commercial businesses. Second, our targeted cost savings are on track for
full realization. This includes both the synergies resulting from TCF, as well as the additional expense actions we
announced last quarter. Third, we are executing on key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. Pipelines are
robust entering 2022 and our teams are focused on driving revenue growth, including the revenue synergy
initiatives related to our new markets and capabilities. Finally, we are very confident in our outlook for 2022 and
beyond.

Slide 5 recaps our year-end review. Our financial results reflect the hard work of our teams over the course of
2021. Return on tangible common equity came in at 19%, excluding notable items. Credit performed very well and
we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We delivered robust organic growth in both consumer and
business checking households, with year-over-year growth of 4.5% and 7%, respectively. We continued to invest
in revenue-producing colleagues and initiatives, including new and expanded commercial banking verticals,
capital markets, cards and payments, and wealth management.
In the commercial bank, we launched EDGE, an innovative analytics tool that supports our bankers' deepening
efforts, incorporating advanced data and insights tailored to each customer. In consumer banking, we built upon
our Fair Play approach and launched new and compelling products and services such as Standby Cash and Early
Pay. We expanded our leading SBA lending program to new states, as well as added to our practice finance
capabilities. We were honored to be recognized for our expertise, evidenced by being ranked number one by J.D.
Power for both customer satisfaction within our region, as well as the top consumer mobile app amongst regional
banks for the third consecutive year. Impressively, this was all achieved while our team successfully completed
the closing and conversion of TCF. On the capital front, we were pleased to accelerate our share repurchase
program as well as increase the common stock dividend.
In closing, our teams accomplished a tremendous amount of work over the course of the year, and I want to thank
all of our colleagues and our management team who supported these efforts. I am increasingly bullish on the year
ahead. The level of excitement is building across the organization and our colleagues are energized and focused.
We look forward to sharing our successes with all of you as we move throughout the year.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.26. Adjusted for notable items, earnings per common share were $0.36.
Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 13.2% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items,
ROTCE was 18.2%. We were pleased to see loan balances rebound substantially during the quarter, driven by
robust new production activity, as total loans increased by $1.4 billion and excluding PPP runoff, loans increased
by $2.4 billion.
Consistent with our plan, we reduced core expenses, excluding notable items, by $21 million from last quarter,
driven by the realization of cost synergies and ongoing highly disciplined expense management. We managed
absolute core expense dollars lower while continuing to grow investments in strategic areas across the bank,
such as digital capabilities, marketing to drive new customer acquisition and relationship deepening, and select
new personnel additions to support our revenue growth initiatives.
Within fee income categories, we saw continued momentum in our capital markets, as well as wealth and
investment businesses. Strong credit performance continued to be a hallmark, with net charge-offs of 12 basis
points and non-performing assets declining by 16% from the prior quarter. We actively managed our capital base,
repurchasing $150 million of common stock in the fourth quarter. To-date, we have completed $650 million of our
$800 million share repurchase program.
Turning to slide 7, period-end loan balances increased by 1.2% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $111.9 billion. Total
loan balances, excluding PPP, increased $2.4 billion, or 2.2% during the quarter, driven by commercial loans.
Within commercial, excluding PPP, loans increased by $2.5 billion, or 4.4% compared to the prior quarter. This

growth was broad based across all major portfolios and was driven by record new commercial loan production.
Growth was led by middle market, corporate and specialty banking, which increased by $1 billion and represented
40% of total commercial loan growth this quarter.
Inventory finance increased by $597 million, auto dealer floor plan increased by $276 million, asset finance
increased by $160 million and commercial real estate increased by $267 million. Within corporate and specialty
banking, each of our commercial verticals contributed to growth this quarter, including corporate banking, tech
and telecom, healthcare and franchise. Inventory finance growth was driven by a combination of seasonally
higher balances due to inventory shipments in the quarter, as well as expansion of existing customer programs.
Higher utilization levels drove approximately two-thirds of the increased balances.
In auto floor plan, we are continuing to add new dealer relationships and growing our overall commitment levels.
In addition, balances benefited from improved utilization rates, which increased from the mid-20s to approximately
30% in the quarter. Even as we delivered record loan production, calling activities across the business continued
at a rapid pace. We ended the quarter with commercial loan pipelines of 34% higher versus the prior quarter and
49% higher than prior year, supporting our outlook for continued loan growth ex-PPP throughout 2022. On the
consumer side, residential mortgage increased by $334 million and auto increased by $129 million. This was
offset by home equity, which declined by $369 million.
Turning to slide 8, deposit balances increased by $1.4 billion, as we continue to experience elevated customer
liquidity and optimize our funding, reducing CD balances by over $700 million. Consumer deposit balances
increased by $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. Commercial balances increased by $300 million from the prior
quarter.
On slide 9, reported net interest income declined modestly from the prior quarter as a result of lower PPP
revenue. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, was stable at $1.085
billion. With ending loan balances well above average balances for the quarter, we entered the first quarter of
2022 with a solid launch point from which to grow core net interest income going forward. Additionally, we
continued to manage excess liquidity by funding loan growth and adding to the securities portfolio, reducing
excess cash at the Fed to $3.7 billion from $8.1 billion at prior-quarter end. On an average basis for the quarter,
excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately 14 basis points.
Turning to slide 10, we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to increase asset sensitivity and provide
downside protection. During the fourth quarter, we added $2.8 billion of securities, and we continued to optimize
our hedging program. We terminated $3.9 billion of receive fixed swaps and floors, and we entered into new pay
fixed swaps in order to bolster our asset sensitivity. As rates move higher, we opportunistically added $5 billion of
receive fixed swaps in order to manage downside risks. At year-end, our modeled net interest income asset
sensitivity in an up 100 basis points scenario was 4.6%. We have steadily increased this metric over the past 18
months, supporting our ability to continue to capture upside opportunity as interest rates increase.
Moving to slide 11, non-interest income was $515 million, up $106 million year-over-year and down $20 million
from last quarter. Lower fee revenues in the fourth quarter were driven by a decline in mortgage banking, primarily
as a result of lower saleable spreads. Our targeted focus on growing strategic fee revenue streams continue to
bear fruit, with capital market fees up $7 million or 18% from the prior quarter.
Wealth and investments and insurance also performed quite well. Card and payments revenues, which are
typically seasonally flat from Q3 to Q4, declined slightly from the prior quarter [ph] impacted at (00:12:14) the
margin by ATM volumes and the debit card conversion for TCF customers during the month of October. The

underlying core business activity in cards and payments continues to be very solid, and we saw a restoration of
ongoing growth in that business as the quarter progressed after conversion. Deposit service charges declined $13
million compared to the prior quarter as a result of TCF customers transitioning onto the Huntington's Fair Play
product set.
Moving on to slide 12, non-interest expense declined $68 million from the prior quarter. And excluding notable
items, core expenses declined by $21 million to $1.034 billion, as we captured cost savings from the acquisition
and exercised disciplined expense management. As we shared previously, we expect our core expenses to trend
down in the first and second quarters, fairly ratably over that period to approximately $1 billion by the second
quarter.
Even as we work to bring down expense levels, we're continuing to invest in initiatives that will drive sustainable
revenue growth while being disciplined in managing our overall expense base. As you saw last quarter, we took
additional actions in order to free up capacity to support these investments while remaining committed to the [ph]
absolute (00:13:36) core expense declines in the near term. Over the longer term, we expect expense growth to
be a function of revenue growth, as we manage within our commitment to positive operating leverage.
Slide 13 highlights our capital position. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.3%, consistent with our prior
guidance to operate within the lower half of our 9% to 10% operating guideline. We have $150 million remaining
of our current share repurchase program.
As you can see on slide 14, credit quality continues to perform well. Net charge-offs declined for the fourth
consecutive quarter. Our non-performing assets declined 15% from the previous quarter. Our ending allowance
for credit losses represented 1.88% of total loans, down from 1.99% at prior-quarter end. The improving economic
outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of $98 million in the fourth quarter.
Slide 15 covers our medium-term financial goals. We are focused on driving sustained revenue growth while
managing expenses within our long term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 17%-plus
return on tangible common equity. We expect to begin seeing this performance in the second half of 2022.
Finally, turning to slide 16, let me share a couple of thoughts on our expectations for 2022. Our outlook is based
on the starting point of our most recent quarterly results with expectations for year-over-year comparisons for the
fourth quarter of 2022. It also assumes continued economic expansion aligned to market consensus, as well as
interest rate yield curve expectations as of early January. We expect average loan growth, ex-PPP, to be up high-
single digits based on our starting point of $107.9 billion. As a result of loan growth and modestly higher net
interest margin, we expect core net interest income on a dollar basis, excluding PPP and purchase accounting
accretion, to grow in the high-single digit to low-double digits range.
Fee revenues are expected to be up low-single digits, driven by robust growth in key categories aligned to our
strategies, including capital markets, our card and treasury management payments businesses, and wealth and
advisory, with offsetting impact from lower year-over-year revenues in mortgage banking and the continued
evolution of our Fair Play products.
As mentioned, we expect to continue to drive sequential reduction in core expenses for the next several quarters,
as we fully realize the TCF cost synergies and benefit from broader expense management. At the same time, we
are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives and new revenue synergy opportunities. We expect the
quarterly run rate of core expenses to be approximately $1 billion by the second quarter and then remaining
relatively stable over the second half of the year from that level.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
In closing, we're keenly focused on the revenue opportunities ahead of us. We have the teams directed toward
these key initiatives, and we're confident in our 2022 outlook to deliver on this plan. We believe these drivers of
our outlook are aligned with our goals for sustained revenue growth, a 17%-plus return on tangible common
equity, and our commitment to annual positive operating leverage.
Now, let me pass it back to Steve for a couple of closing comments before we open up for Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Zach. Slide 17 summarizes what we believe is a compelling opportunity. Huntington stands as a
powerful top 10 regional bank with scale and leading market density, as well as a compelling set of capabilities
both in footprint and nationally. We're focused on driving sustainable revenue growth, which is bolstered by new
markets and new businesses. This growth opportunity augments our underlying businesses, in many cases,
where we have top 10 market positions.
As a result of these factors, we've demonstrated robust financial performance that we expect to further improve as
we move throughout 2022. We believe our return on capital will be in the top tier versus peers, which results in
substantial value creation for shareholders.
Tim, let's open up the call for Q&A.

our first question today is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, maybe just wanted to follow up around the expense guidance, Zach. You mentioned about $1 billion flat-
lining in the back half, but just give us a little bit of puts and takes in terms of where the savings are coming right
now. I'm sure much like everyone else, you're investing in the franchise. So, if you don't mind giving us a lens of
like how we should think about little bit of a medium-term expense growth outlook, or are there saving
opportunities at the bank where expenses could be around these levels for more than just 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think it's an area of important focus for us as well. [indiscernible] (00:19:32) really
pleased with the trajectory that we're on here. And we've talked about it for a while we're committed to take our
expenses from the high-water mark in Q3 of 2021 of $1.055 billion down to that $1 billion over a three-quarter
period, and we saw the first step down in Q4 of $21 million. We expect to see the remaining fairly ratably in Q1
and Q2 and then fairly steady for the balance of 2022.
I think as you get beyond 2022 and on to the future, the way we're looking at it is to manage within the confines of
our commitment to positive operating leverage, just as we have for the eight of the last nine years. Given our
revenue growth trajectory and what we expect to be pretty solid and sustained revenue growth, that'll provide the
capacity to maintain expenses within that level and still invest back in the business. And clearly, there will be
plenty of opportunities as we go forward to continue to drive scale, efficiencies, process improvement, automation
and lots of ways to drive efficiencies that'll allow us to plough back investments into the key initiatives while still
achieving that positive operating leverage.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Got it. And just as a follow-up, as part of the loan growth guidance, if you could remind us, I mean, TCF obviously
had a bunch of businesses that are levered towards CapEx and inventory rebuild, both in auto dealer and outside
of that. How much of that is baked into this loan growth guidance and what's the potential for loan growth actually
exceeding expectations that you've outlined?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, the guidance, as we talked about, was high-single digits for loan growth overall. It'll be driven by
production. I think, it will look pretty similar to what we saw in Q4, that is commercial led, driven by production and
really supported by what we're seeing from our customers and just really robust pipeline and calling activities at
this point. And it's across all the commercial sectors, including those that we've now incorporated from TCF,
middle market, corporate banking, specialty verticals, but also really important contributors from the inventory
finance business, the vendor and asset finance business that we picked up from TCF as well. In addition, I would
point out, continued contribution from the consumer side as well. We are expecting sustained growth in resi [ph]
on sheet (00:22:00), auto, RV and marine and also likely benefiting there from lower prepays as we go forward.
We have assumed a modest contribution from utilization improvement during the year and that will contribute to
some degree. But I would note that that $5 billion of line utilization below pre-pandemic levels is just a massive
coiled spring that will enable us to fuel growth likely some in the back half of 2022, much more as we go out to the
future into 2023 and beyond.

Hey. I wanted to start by maybe drilling down a little into the margin. Zach, maybe sort of your best thoughts on
how you see the margin trajecting throughout the year. I guess, maybe the best starting point is probably the
adjusted 2.78% margin. And to the extent that you're comfortable, any thoughts on sort of your best estimate for
how much benefit you would get from each Fed rate hike?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Yeah, it's a great question. The guidance implies stable to slightly higher, and that's my expectation to continue to
kind of trend ratably higher as we go forward. And I think the dynamic that we'll see is very similar to what we've
been talking about for a while. We'll see a slow roll-off of our previous – pre-existing hedging program, but that'll
be offset by benefits in reductions in the level of excess liquidity and the drag on margin that, that represents, we
talked about 14 basis point drag in Q4. [indiscernible] (00:23:47) we do expect a lot of that to run off, if not all of it
to run off during 2022, which will be a benefit. And then the rate environment, which to the point of your question
is, somewhat uncertain just given where the expectations for rate hikes are at this point in the forward yield curve,
but I do expect that to be a positive contributor as we go forward here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And just sort of to be clear, I think in your prepared remarks, you noted that the NII guide was
based on early January market expectations. So, does that embed then three Fed rate hikes into the guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, correct. So, the planning and budgeting that we've completed was based on the early January rate curve
that had three rate hikes in it. Over the last few weeks, clearly the curve has moved and sort of roughly pulled
about a month forward what had previously been a trajectory around the forward yield curve [ph] such that now
there's (00:24:44) I think a fourth hike now forecasted in the very last period in the year, that should be helpful for
our Q4 guidance. But I would point you back to the guidance as likely being the key range there inclusive of that.

I wanted to start – so the net interest income outlook for 2022 has a pretty wide range, high-single digit to low-
double digit. Can you walk through – because you're basing it on the forward curve, so what is the swing factor
that will take you either to the low end of that range or high end of that range?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I'd say it's mainly driven by where we end on asset growth. The more asset growth we have, the
more kind of incremental NII lift we'll have on a growth basis just given the fact that the yield will be stable to up.
That's the big driver there. I think as well just further to the last question, where the rate curve ends up going
throughout the course of the year, it's clearly been somewhat volatile here over the last several months. At [ph]
where it is now, (00:26:02) I think our guidance stands and – but those are the dynamics that [ph] drives the range
of that (00:26:09).

Got it. So, if the average loans come out of high-single digits, you'd be somewhere on the midpoint, is that safe to

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then on expenses, you guys seem to be one of the few banks not lifting the expense outlook
given all this lockdown inflation. Are you just not seeing as much wage pressure and inflation in your footprint, or
are you just finding more offsets that others aren't finding? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think we're clearly seeing some indicators of inflation within the business. I would – most notably
hiring new talent and [ph] we started (00:26:47) with the compensation expectations from our top talent. And I
would note, when we talk to our clients, particularly those that are commodity-intensive businesses or labor-
intensive businesses, their feeling is having to adjust to manage it. At this point, the direct impacts on our expense
base have been relatively limited. And we anticipate some wage inflation as we're going into the year and try to
get ahead of it. We took a series of actions around compensation. We announced an increase to our minimum
wage across the company to $19 an hour from what had previously been $17. We made a number of other
priority adjustments. And so, we think we've got it boxed now in the 2022 plan and included in our guidance.
Lastly, I guess I would – I'd call it – I think there's a unique point in time that we have that perhaps some others
don't, where we've got the benefits of scale coming from the TCF acquisition, both the cost synergies that we've
already defined and are executing against. But over the long term, we see more opportunities to continue to refine

growth [ph] plus some (00:27:51) revenues.

Steven, just to add on, we took some actions in the third quarter and that includes 62 branch consolidations that
will happen in early February. And we took some other management what we stylize as organization issues as
well. So, we anticipated some level of inflation coming into the year, we'll try to get ahead of it with those actions
taken in the third quarter.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. I was wondering, Zach, in the outlook for NII, you talked about
the loan growth side. I was just wondering if you could fill that in and tell us how you're thinking about both the
growth and mix on the deposit side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I do expect to see deposit growth begin to accelerate here, and I think it will be a pretty balanced mix
between consumer and commercial as we go forward. For the last several quarters, we've been putting sort of
smaller emphasis on that just given how strong liquidity has been throughout the system, and the teams are re-
pivoting back to drive that growth. And so, that'll be a good balance to [ph] fund what (00:29:13) we expect to be,
as I noted, accelerated loan growth throughout the year.

Right. And that's what I was wondering, like are you expecting earning assets to still grow or is it more about
remixing the left side of the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Look, I think we'll see a bit of incremental growth in the securities portfolio. We're watching the elevated liquidity
situation pretty closely, and same playbook we've been operating with the last several quarters, just taking an
incremental view month-by-month, looking at where that trend is and optimizing to see if it's appropriate to add
additional securities. But I do think there's [ph] going to be some remixing (00:29:47) as we see loan growth start
to accelerate to hit the high-single digit guidance that we've given.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. Okay. And the – just can you tell us in your fee guide what you're using in terms of the Fair Play impact and
outlook on overdrafts and related fees? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, let's talk about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Okay, let me start. We introduced Fair Play 12 years ago. So, brought out 24-Hour Grace and Asterisk-Free
Checking. We've been doing I think almost every year the – in 2014 we noted all the deposits, but more recently
in 2020, we put the safety zone in $50 minimum and we took 24-Hour Grace to our business customers because
of the pandemic and the impact on small businesses, and we felt that was the right time and thing to do to help
those businesses at that point in time. And last year, we came forward with Standby Cash in Early Pay. And
obviously, we've rolled all that out effective with the conversion to the TCF customers. So, we pointed out an
expected drag off that.
We've gotten ourselves into a leadership position I think for more than the last decade in this area, it's added to
our brand value, our customer household growth, our relationship retention and expansion and significant
deepening across products. So, that has added to our brand and our loyalty. And I think as we go forward, we'll
still retain this leadership role. There are plans we have in place of going back number of months to do some
more looking out for our customers with Fair Play. Obviously with what the industry is doing and pivot in the last
month or so, we're watching that closely and we would expect to react to that and we'll communicate more going
forward. But that guidance range includes what we're contemplating as we move forward this year in Fair Play
and [ph] other piece (00:31:52).
Maybe, Zach, you could embellish the guidance, [ph] if you will. (00:31:55)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, let me tack on to what – the comment Steve just made. When we construct these product changes, we
think about the economics holistically. There are fees that we see on a gross basis, like overdraft, but there are
also a lot of other levers in the consumer checking product economics, like other related account fees, other
product features and, over time, really importantly, the impact that that market leadership position has on elevated

acquisition, the kind of retention and the relationship deepening that we can drive. And so, to be clear, included in
my guidance on the overall fee line is the assumption of a net fee reduction of approximately $16 million in Q4
from these changes. I would expect them to be in place by the middle of the year.
I would highlight that notwithstanding that impact, we do expect to see continued growth on the overall fee line as
indicated by my guidance in the low-single digits driven by those strategic categories, capital markets, payments,
wealth and advisory.
In addition to the fee impacts from the changes we're anticipating in our consumer products, we also expect to
see a reduction of between $3 million and $5 million per quarter in charge-offs, as the lower overdraft fees that we
charge on a gross basis create just fewer incidences of uncollectible fees and it has lower charge-offs.
Just taking a step back, maybe kind of concluding on this discussion, we really believe that the positioning of our
products is critical and as we maintain that market leadership – this is a play we've run many times before, and
the benefits we see in acquisition, retention and deepening as we maintain that leadership, we would expect to
earn back that run rate fee loss in approximately 18 to 24 months, very much consistent with what we've seen in
the past.

A question for you guys. Obviously, the expense guidance and the revenue guidance looks pretty good. And

risk, you still have fairly high reserves relative to peers. I know some of that's accounting, but with the [ph] lower

(00:34:21) loss expectations, and Zach, what you just said as [ph] loan (00:34:23) charge-offs, can you help us
think through the provision expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, I mean – this is Rich. Let me take that. We feel very good about the condition of the portfolio right now. The
charge-offs for the year and the reduction in the NPAs both notable and both very positive. As it relates to the
provision and the allowance, we have always been on the conservative side of the allowance, and we started
CECL day one on the high end. And we've been very conservative on the way up and I think very prudent on the
way down, and we'll continue that way.
And there are things that we're looking at in the economy as it relates to supply chain and labor, that type of thing,
and just the continuing impacts of the COVID that are just giving us pause as it relates to where we set the
allowance. But it's a very disciplined process that we go through every quarter. We've had five consecutive
reductions in the ACL ratio since we peaked in the third quarter of 2020. And we'll look at it every quarter, as we
always do, with a very disciplined approach and if the supply chain ease – conditions ease and labor conditions
start to improve, I would expect that we'll have continued reductions over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Jon, our outlook is for reductions during 2022 and charge-offs below the historic range. And we ended the year
with very good credit quality and very pleased with the performance of the portfolio that came over with TCF. So,
loans have been re- [ph] rated, (00:36:03) so there's consistency now as of the end of year and the economic
outlook, plus what we see in the customer bases, is – gives us a lot of optimism as we go forward on the provision
line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That helps. And then just as a follow-up, Steve, maybe more of a medium-term view on credit, it seems like
– you obviously have strong growth and I know you're a risk person by nature, but the entire industry has strong
growth expectations as well. Curious how long you think this all lasts without any real concerns on credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
My current belief, Jon, is that we're going to go through 2024 with a fairly robust GDP growth and performance on
credit. And there's just an enormous amount of stimulus that's been enacted thus far and some of it is multiyear.
We're [ph] – look, (00:37:00) the economy has performed well, but there's been labor constraint. As that sorts out,
I think that puts longer legs into the growth. The supply chain issues that we face that are constraining production
– did constrain in 2021 will do so for much of 2022, if not all year, will get abated over time. We think things will
get better a bit in the second half, but in some of these industries, 2023 will become a more normal year.
So, those factors and others give us confidence that we've got a multiyear positive slope on loan growth and GDP
and underlying credit quality. [indiscernible] (00:37:43) remain disciplined. And we published the quarterly results
for consumer, and there's literally no variance over the last decade-plus. So, we're quite confident of our
capabilities to manage the risks at these levels. We're very pleased with the additional talent we've gathered from
TCF, both in the origination side and in the credit areas as we think about the future. So, 2025 or beyond would
be where we're a little more concerned than we will be over the next few years.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please proceed with your
questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Zach, I wanted to follow up on Ken's questions just with regards to the outlook for service charges
on deposit with the Fair Play. So, it was down $13 million this quarter. Can you just go through what the outlook is
from fourth quarter levels just with the puts and takes that you talked about, again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Absolutely. Good question. We converted the TCF customers on the second week of October, so we have
almost the entire quarter's worth of run rate of the TCF customers on to the Fair Play product in Q4. There might
be a very marginal incremental impact into Q1, but for the most part, we're kind of at the new level trending. And
as we said, we are continuing to roll out new product changes, frankly of the same kind of nature that we were
doing across the last 10 years, but we do expect to respond to what's happening and to do that by the middle of
this year and that will drive the roughly $16 million incremental quarterly run rate reduction in fees on a net basis
by Q4, just to be clear, in the guidance. So, those are I think the puts and takes, kind of a relatively flat level and
then we'll see a – that those new changes come into place at mid-year with that roughly $16 million quarterly
reduction in Q4.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And – that's helpful. And then just I was wondering, could you just give an update on revenue
synergies from TCF, where you're seeing the biggest opportunities and what's happening in some of the newer
markets. And I think back to the FirstMerit deal, I think it was about $100 million in revenue synergies. I'm just
wondering if maybe you could quantify what the impact could be with TCF.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We're really, really pleased with where they're going. We've talked about this a little bit in multiple
conferences [ph] but there are (00:40:30) four – or five big buckets of them. The – expanding our corporate
business in the middle market, the corporate space, our specialty businesses into the major commercial hubs
within the formerly TCF geographic footprint. Like, what should – expanding in Chicago, expanding in Detroit,
Denver is brand new, Minneapolis and St. Paul brand new to Huntington. So, that's a big one. Bringing the
consumer product set to TCF customers, we're seeing – is the second major bucket, and we're seeing terrific
early signs of engagement in how folks are reacting to not only the product set, but the digital channels and

capabilities. Third is expanding our business banking and market leading SBA production into the TCF
geographies, and we're well underway hiring out those teams and beginning to get early traction.
Wealth management and private banking is an enormous fourth opportunity for us. And we've already begun to
build out very significant teams, for example, in Minneapolis Twin Cities and in Denver. And then lastly, just
leveraging the – really now quite sizeable scale, equipment and inventory finance business, combining what we
had before and then the great businesses that we brought over from TCF. So, those are the five big buckets. And
we're seeing traction and wins already. We haven't given precise guidance on that in the past. I'm not ready to do
that today. But it's already contributing to the growth outlook and helping us to drive the kind of acceleration that
we expect to see in both fees and loans in 2022. And as we go forward, we could even provide more and more
color on that as those continues to develop.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Zach, if I could add, the capital markets fee income lift in the fourth quarter was at least in part related to the
combination of TCF. So, middle market banking didn't exist in Chicago or the Twin Cities or Denver. For TCF, the
broker/dealer was outsourced. When we talk about wealth, there's just a – there are a number of product
categories and capabilities that we have that we'll be bringing into these expanded markets. And then in the
context of the things that TCF did incredibly well, asset finance, inventory finance, et cetera, we have now the
ability to cross-sell into that customer base, which historically was not done. So, on the consumer side, 1.5 million
consumers that – we have a much more robust product menu set that we'll be offering and we're a multiple on
home equity, and – again, which was not offered in the [ph] abridged (00:43:15) delivery system by TCF, as well
as mortgage, so we're excited across the board. We think we have a lot of consumer end-business opportunities
on the cross-sell side.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. I just had a few cleanup questions on NII sensitivity. But Steve, I thought it was very interesting
when a large bank kicked off earnings saying 24-Hour Grace, and something you kicked off 12 years ago. My first
question is for Zach. Zach, could you tell us in the 4.6% NII sensitivity, what you're assuming for deposit repricing
in that analysis, and what do you expect to actually happen as you think about the first few rate hikes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, it's a good question, Erika. Thank you. As it relates to deposit betas, I think it's a little too early to tell. We're
expecting similar dynamics to the last major rate cycle. We do believe there'll be competing forces here

[indiscernible] (00:44:28) the extremely low level of starting rates we're at right now would tend to indicate a
higher beta. With that being said, the level of – extraordinary levels of excess liquidity across the system would
tend to mute that and indicate a lower beta. So, I'd say, we're watching the situation very carefully on liquidity and
the pace of loan growth, we will be disciplined and dynamic as we go forward.
In the actual modeling of the asset sensitivity, those models are intended to be stable on average over time, and
irrespective of the current level of interest rates to model the ramp. And so the assumptions in that are around
25% to 30% beta, which has been the long term average we've seen. I would tell you, I believe there's an
opportunity that it will be lower than that in the initial rate moves. And that's my general expectation. But again, I
think we'll be – we'll have to be dynamic and we'll watch it really carefully.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And my follow-up question to that is, yesterday – and this kind of follows up to what Ken Usdin was asking about
earlier, a few regional banks were now expecting negative deposit growth. To your earlier point, Zach, the system
is awash with liquidity. And a few big banks kicked off earnings season saying that deposit growth won't be
negative and a few regional banks mentioned yesterday that they expect deposit growth to be negative. And I'm
wondering, Huntington has always been known for its core operational deposit base, plus you added TCF. I'm
wondering how you're thinking about deposit growth. You mentioned it's going to be positive this year, but as we
have more maturity in the rate cycle, how do you expect deposit growth to behave on an overall basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I do think – our current expectation and the trend we're seeing in the business would indicate we'll continue
to see deposit growth in 2022. I think there's sort of two factors we've been watching that are slightly offsetting
each other. On one hand, we are observing, particularly in the consumer space, some degree of normalization of
the elevated liquidity that we saw build up at the tail end of 2020 and certainly into 2021, largely influenced by
stimulus and other factors like that and the [ph] stay-at-homes (00:46:54) behavior around COVID. So, that is a
sort of a gradual normalization. With that being said, our customer acquisition and the ongoing work we're doing
to deepen relationships, certainly augmented by the TCF synergy opportunities, are offsetting that and we expect
to drive net growth in consumer offsetting that [indiscernible] (00:47:21) pandemic deposit normalization trend that
I noted.
On the commercial side, we're seeing just continued robust liquidity in our clients and that's driving solid deposit
growth. And as we focus on that even more going forward to continue to fund this accelerating loan growth, we'll
see that contribute as well. So, overall, I'm expecting pretty balanced deposit growth between the two, and I think
those are the kind of underlying drivers of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Zach, if I could add to Erika's question. We've put a liquidity portal in play for our commercial customers a year
and a half ago to try and take excess deposits and move them off balance sheet, Erika. So, we're not sitting with a
cumulative superjumbo set of commercial depositors in the portfolio. We just didn't want that risk profile plus we
felt we could do a better job looking at the customers by putting them into [indiscernible] (00:48:17). So, that will
help cushion ourselves as wherever normalization, if there is any, [ph] out of the customer base occurs
(00:48:26).

Secondly, we've introduced a digital tool, an analytics tool, that has great promise for us. We've got roughly
500,000 business customers and we're now able to get at the data in a much more real-time way in terms of

your questions.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. You guys are the number one SBA lender, and I was wondering if you could talk about what
you're seeing in terms of demand there, now that PPP is kind of mostly done or winding down. I would imagine
when PPP was going on, there was kind of little to no demand, and I'm wondering how that's been trending more
recently.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Matt, we had a cumulative with TCF 12 – over $12 billion of PPP lending. And notwithstanding that, we had robust
SBA lending almost in parallel through the last two years. As we entered the fourth quarter, we continued to see
demand for that product and we expect it will actually increase this year in part because of the new markets that
we're going to be able to expose our capabilities to: Twin Cities, great business market; Denver on fire, really
terrific; Colorado is a terrific state to be doing business in. And now, we're at – roughly at scale in Chicago with
150-plus points of distribution versus 30. That will help those three regions drive our lending activity overall,
including SBA.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Interesting. And then separately, credit quality question, you're a very big auto underwriter on the consumer side
and commercial, but I'm focused on the consumer side. We've had this massive increase in used car prices. Any
thoughts in terms of tightening standards as we think about LTVs, you've had a little bit of a trend down there
what you disclose in the appendix. But just how do you think about underwriting for these used cars that have
increased 40%, 45% versus a year ago?

Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, it's Rich. I'll take that. And as you noted in the slides, the LTVs have come down. We peaked in 2019
at 90% and at the end of 2021 at 85%, so we have reacted to the increase in auto prices by bringing the LTVs
down. But first and foremost for us, the auto business is really based on client selection. We are a super prime
lender, and we've developed a custom scorecard over many, many years in this business that very effectively
predicts those customers that are not going to have a payment issue. And so, for us, it's really avoiding the
situation where you have to get the car back in the first place, and we've done a phenomenal job of doing that
over time.
We also feel that – we've been in this business a long time and we have to be a consistent provider of capital to
our dealers. And so, we've, over the course of many cycles, worked through high prices, low prices, high demand,
low demand, and we've had learnings from all of that as we've been one of the leading auto dealer – or auto
financers in the country going back in time. So, I feel that we've got a good handle on the risk here,
notwithstanding the increase in car prices. We've adjusted our custom scorecards appropriately and feel that
we're going to come through this in really good shape as we always have.

Matt, and we haven't had a delinquency on the floor plan side of this business in, I'm going to say, decades,
certainly more than a decade since I've been around. And we really like the underlying credit quality performance
that the dealers were able to generate the last couple of years. So, the fundamentals of the business with a low
expected default rate in the indirect side and an incredibly low risk on the dealer side continue to keep us very
bullish on the business.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hi, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hi, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I guess back to that auto question, I know in the – in your loan growth outlook for high-single digits for 2022, you
did mention auto growth as a driver. I mean, on the growth side, can you just talk about what – how you're
thinking about the portfolio growth as you look [ph] at the year, (00:53:41) particularly if we get some moderation
in used auto demand as the, let's call it, the reopening continues and everything? So, wanted to get your updated
thoughts on that portfolio, specifically in terms of growth. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, John, we would expect that portfolio will continue to grow, we're going to open up in another five or so states
this year. We've had this gradual rollout now for a number of years, and that'll complete [ph] us. (00:54:09)
Eventually, we will be in the Lower 48 with this business. But we have a fundamental expectation of – that the
new car market's going to come back off of last year's production probably by 1.5 million, 2 million cars to get 15
million, 15.5 million total on the new side. So, that will pick up a bit.
The mix will slightly shift again back to where it has historically or closer to that on the mix side of the equation. As
you know, we like the business. We think of it as low risk. It's a 2.75 year average durated asset. And we're highly
now automated. We have almost half our apps coming through on a digital basis and its end to end digital for us.
So, we're very, very efficient with it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, great. And then also related to that, I believe the utilization comment you gave earlier in terms of increasing
from the mid-20s to the 30%, that's for the floor plan business I believe, which is – correct me if I'm wrong. And
then if it is, what is your utilization trend for the non-floor plan commercial revolvers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach, I'll take that. We saw nice upticks, modest upticks in utilization in every one of our three major
line utilization categories. Auto, just to your point, rose from 23% to 30% in the quarter. Inventory finance rose
from 25% to 32%, to some degree, seasonally. That's typical in the fourth quarter of that business. And then the
general middle market revolvers went from 40% to 41% in the quarter. So, we saw good early signs here,
encouraging signs of that utilization recovery. And we saw, as I said in my earlier remarks, $5 million of additional
line utilization [ph] to when (00:56:11) we expect to recover back to pre-pandemic levels over the longer term.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Got it. Got it. If I could ask just one more high level one, just [ph] off some (00:56:19) news this morning about
Intel looking to build a pretty sizable chip facility there near Columbus, and just wanted to get your thoughts on the
implications of something like that. Do you think there's follow-on benefits to the – to loan demand there in your
markets? And do you think there's a start of something where more of these tech companies could be building
operations there in your markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
John, just for the benefit of everybody, what you're referencing is Intel's announcing a large chip plant, the CEO of
Intel called it the largest chip plant in the world, it'll be about 1 million square feet. It is initially a land set aside of
1,000 acres to accommodate this. It's expected that there 'll be follow-ons and that there'll be other businesses,
large businesses, suppliers to that plant that will co-locate as part of that 1,000 acre site.
And this will be enormously impactful. I think the CEO, Pat Gelsinger, referenced this as a Silicon Heartland
because typically, these plants with the supplier base creates some level of "co-location" that we would – that
you've seen in Arizona and certain other markets. So, this is incredibly impactful. It's a great move by the DeWine
administration. I think it'll benefit certainly all of Ohio and much of the Midwest.
And I think it's a bit of a game changer for us. We're going to have more than 10,000 construction jobs on that site
and – roadway and water expansion. And then ultimately, there'll be 3,000 very high paying jobs in the plant itself
just with Intel. Again, there's an expectation of other businesses coming in for co-location, significant other
businesses. All of that will feed and fuel, I think, what's already a very robust real estate market where there's
going to be housing needs, there'll be additional transportation needs, the small business around – small
businesses around these areas will do very, very well. So, it's a huge moment for us here in all of Ohio, certainly
Central Ohio. But I think this has the potential to be enormous.
If I reflect back in 2009 when I joined Huntington, this was termed the Rust Belt, and that term has receded
significantly over the years. And I think Intel's going to be a game changer in terms of technology in the region,
and I'm very excited about what's going on. So, again, kudos to Governor DeWine and his administration.
Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted was enormously important here as well. But this came together in an incredibly
efficient and quick fashion, and there's insight about it on both the local paper, Columbus Dispatch, as well as – I
think TIME has a lead article featuring it. We're really, really pleased and I believe this is, again, a huge moment
for us and a game-changing moment for Ohio.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Hi. Thanks. I was hoping to get your thoughts on capital management and just appetite for share repurchase in
the first half of 2022 with capital at about 9.3% at the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. Thanks for presenting the chance to close on this one. We are really pleased with
what we've done so far in the $800 million share repurchase authorization that we had [ph] as we noted
(01:00:16) consistent with our guidance, front loaded $650 million of that through the end of 2021. I think as we go
forward, our capital priorities have not changed. We're still very much focused on funding asset growth first,
supporting our dividend and then sort of all other uses, including this. So, as we see loan growth accelerating,
we're pleased to be able to put the capital back toward that. And as it relates to share repurchases – sorry for the
background noise there -- we intend to be dynamic here and also to think about it in the context of our ongoing
work around our next capital budget submission, which is – which will reset the balance of 2022 as well with a
submission in early April. So, dynamic seizing opportunities here in the next couple of quarters I think is where
we're going to go.
