Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start with a few remarks on the quarter,
and then Dermot will take you through the financials in greater detail. In short, BNY reported strong third quarter
results, reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities.
Stepping back on the macro-side for a moment. At the beginning of the year, markets had priced in significant
monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns. Despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic
outlook since then, we've now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world, including a
50-basis point reduction in policy rates in the US as the Federal Reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance
employment, inflation, and growth. Following increased market volatility and a sell-off in equities in early August,
markets recovered and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher.
A little more micro, but relevant for markets – around the most recent quarter-end, the market saw simultaneous
flows into the Fed's Reverse Repo Facility, alongside the first meaningful usage of the Standing Repo Facility –
both of which we administer. At the same time, sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher
repo rates, possibly signaling a transition from "abundant" to "ample" reserves in the system with potential
implication for the pace of QT going forward.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
More broadly, while markets have been constructive, there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead. And so, we
constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist – from geopolitical tensions and conflicts, to fiscal
deficits, and the impact of impending regulations and elections.
Now referring to page 2 of the financial highlights presentation. As I said earlier, BNY delivered a strong financial
performance in the third quarter with strong EPS growth on the back of broad-based revenue growth and positive
operating leverage.
Reported earnings per share of $1.50 were up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per
share of $1.52 were up 20%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased by 5% year-over-year and reported expenses
of $3.1 billion were flat.
Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 1% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in our
people and technology, while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better
ways.
Pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved year-over-year to 33% and 23%, respectively. For
the first time in our history, we reported over $50 trillion of assets under custody and/or administration at the end
of the quarter.
Now custody is not something we are, but it is something important that we do. This number one market position
improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company, and it provides opportunity to drive
value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of BNY to our clients.
We increasingly see that the true power of BNY's client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across
our leading Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services, and Investments and Wealth businesses. We have
the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new, innovative solutions to the market
from across the seams of these businesses.
As an example, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Archer, a leading technology-enabled service
provider of managed account solutions to the asset and wealth management industry. Archer provides
comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the
fastest-growing investment vehicles in the industry – managed accounts – at scale – expanding distribution,
streamlining operations, launching new investment products, and delivering personalized outcomes for their
clients.
The integration of Archer should produce a positive impact across several of our lines of business. In addition to
augmenting our Asset Servicing capabilities for managed accounts, Archer will provide our Investments business,
as well as our Wove wealth advisor platform in Pershing, with expanded distribution of model portfolios and
access to Archer's multi-custodial network. Buy it once, use it many, if you will.
The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, and we look forward to welcoming the Archer
team to BNY.
Another one of the fastest-growing areas in financial services – Alternatives – also presents a promising
opportunity for us to deliver new client solutions across one-BNY. We already have relationships with hundreds of
alternatives managers, as well as roughly $3 trillion of wealth assets on our platforms. We believe there is more

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast-
growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries, advisors, and the investors they serve.
Last month, we introduced Alts Bridge – a comprehensive data, software, and services solution built for wealth
advisors. Alts Bridge aims to make investing in Alternatives easier for advisors through a streamlined end-to-end
experience, and direct integration into advisors' existing desktops, starting with our Pershing NetX360+ and Wove
platforms.
As we continue to deliver new, innovative products, we are also addressing the significant opportunity from
enhancing our commercial model, making it easier for clients to navigate BNY. In order to accomplish this, we are
promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage, and we are operationalizing our new commercial model.
For example, over the summer and for the first time in recent memory, we brought together several hundred of
BNY's client-facing commercial leaders from around the world, as well as members of our Executive Committee,
for a two-day event we called Commercial Liftoff. This program enabled our top client coverage people and their
business partners to take a one-BNY view to account planning – creating a shared vision for serving each of our
clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients' objectives, and
developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals.
During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to
a Platforms Operating Model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive
change across the company.
In September, we went live with the next step on our multi-year plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and
elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well. We now have about 13,000 – or about
one-quarter – of our people working in our new operating model.
As we've said before, powering our one-BNY culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company
better requires not just words but action. I want to thank our people around the world for their hard work, and for
collectively pulling together as a team to create the change for our clients, for our shareholders, and for one
another.
To wrap up, the combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together, and the
strength of our balance sheet gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable,
long-term shareholder value.
While our results in the third quarter demonstrate continued execution against our strategic priorities, as well as
progress towards our medium-term financial targets, our team remains focused on the work ahead.
With that, over to you, Dermot.

Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 3 of the presentation, I'll begin with our
consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue
was up 5%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees, reflecting higher market values and net new
business across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up
2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.
Firmwide AUC/A of $52.1 trillion were up 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business,
and client inflows. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting
higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar.
Foreign exchange revenue increased by 14%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $196
million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading. The year-over-year
increase primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of last year, and
improved results from our seed capital investments.
Net interest income increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio
yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix.
Expenses of $3.1 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This
reflects higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for
credit losses was $23 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve builds related to commercial real estate
exposure.
As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year, and excluding
notable items, earnings per share were $1.52, up 20% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on
tangible common equity was 23%.
Turning to Capital and Liquidity on page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%. Tier 1 capital
increased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and improvement in
accumulation of other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned to our shareholders through
common stock repurchases and dividends.
Average assets increased by 1%. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%. CET1 capital increased by
5%, and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the
course of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we returned 103% of earnings through dividends and buybacks.
Moving to Liquidity. The consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 116%, a 1-percentage point increase
sequentially due to a favorable change in our deposit composition. And the consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio
was 132%, unchanged sequentially.
Next, Net Interest Income and the underlying Balance Sheet Trends on page 5. Net interest income of over $1
billion was up 3% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was helped by higher
sponsored cleared repo activity amidst market volatility and increased client demand. Average deposit balances
remained flat sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 2% in the quarter, and interest-bearing
deposits were flat. Average interest-earning assets were up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our investment securities
portfolio balances as well as loan balances increased by 1%, and cash and reverse repo balances remained flat.
Our broader liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high at the end of the quarter of over $1.5 trillion worth of
client cash across deposits, money market funds, securities lending, sponsored cleared repo, and other short-
term investment alternatives.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Turning to our business segments starting on page 6. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up
6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment
services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values. For the third quarter in a row, the impact of
repricing was de minimis.
ETF AUC/A of $2.7 trillion was up more than 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced was up 20%
year-on-year. Inflows into ETFs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes.
As the ETF industry continues to grow, we are dedicated to scaling our best-in-class ETF service offering. For
example, we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution
platform to advance digital adoption.
In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 1%. Net new business and higher client activity in Corporate
Trust was partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts fees, reflecting corporate actions in the prior year. Against
the backdrop of increased issuance activity, we continued to see strength in Corporate Trust, capitalizing on our
investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability. In this segment, foreign exchange
revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of
client activity.
Net interest income for the segment was up 2% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were down 3%
year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher investments
and employee merit increases. Pre-tax income was $642 million – a 38% increase year-over-year – and pre-tax
margin was 29%.
Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion,
up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment
services fees were down 1%, reflecting the impact of lost business in the prior year, partially offset by higher
market values.
Net new assets were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of lost business in
the prior year, which is now largely behind us. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 4% annualized
net new asset growth in the third quarter.
Wove continues to see strong client demand. We signed up 14 additional clients in the third quarter, and we
remain on track for the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in 2024 as we guided in January. Wove is helping us
attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. For example, Pershing provides custody and
clearing solutions for Sanctuary, a large and fast-growing wealth manager servicing the high-net-worth and ultra-
high-net-worth segments. Sanctuary will also leverage Wove portfolio solutions, trading and rebalancing, and
reporting for teams that custody with Pershing as well as those that use another custodian.
In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees increased by 16%, primarily reflecting higher
collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. Against the backdrop of a growing market and active
trading, US securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong. As you may remember, we
created our Global Clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of Pershing Institutional Solutions.
We're pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing,
settlement, execution, and financing solutions in over 100 markets around the world.

In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting net new business. The business
continues to execute well against the growth agenda we presented in January. And we are seeing our
investments in modernizing and digitizing our payments platform pay off in the form of growth in our strategic
target markets.
Net interest income for the segment overall was up 3% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $834 million were
up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency
savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin.
Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total
revenue of $849 million, up 2% year-over-year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 1%,
reflecting higher market values and improved seed capital results, partially offset by lower performance fees and
the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 6%, reflecting higher market values and
net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix.
Segment expenses of $672 million were flat year-over-year, as efficiency savings offset employee merit increases
and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $176 million – up 7% year-over-year – and pre-tax margin was 21%.
As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion increased by 18% year-over-year, primarily
reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar.
In the third quarter, we saw strength in our short-term strategies with $24 billion of net inflows into cash, reflecting
our leading position and strong investment performance in our Dreyfus money market funds. Long-term active
strategies saw $8 billion of net outflows spread across multi-asset, LDI and active equity, partially offset by net
inflows into fixed income. And we saw $16 billion of net outflows from Index strategies.
Wealth Management client assets of $333 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market
values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the Other segment.
Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on the outlook for the year. Starting with net interest income. Remember,
we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for full-year net interest
income to be down 10% in 2024. While we're currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be
slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results, the resilience of our net interest income over the
first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the full-year net interest income
growth rate from January by approximately five percentage points.
Regarding expenses, we continue to work hard to keep core expenses, excluding notable items, for the full-year
2024, roughly flat. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full-year 2024 to be at the lower end of the 23% to
24% range we estimated in January.
And lastly, as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our
shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and we remain on track, having returned 103% of earnings year-
to-date.
In conclusion, our results this past quarter reflect broad-based growth across our three business segments and
continued progress on our strategic priorities. We're pleased with the company's performance year-to-date, and
we're proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our medium-term financial targets while we all
remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged some of the ETF wins that you had on the servicing
side, so curious about that. Number one, how much of that was the BlackRock business that you've won? And
has the revenue from that win, that big win, fully turned on? Or like is the fee rate lower because fees in Asset
Servicing were up about 5%, but AUC, 16%, and I know sometimes the ETF fee rates are a little lower. So
curious to flesh that out a bit. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thanks for the question. I don't really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction, but just to take a
step back on ETFs. Generally, it is a growing market. You may have watched Larry from BlackRock on CNBC this
morning. It is a secular trend. It is a very big and growing market. And we are a key player in that. As I said in my
prepared remarks, we have $2.7 trillion on the platform. That's up 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds
serviced is up 20%. That's on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology, so we can be
best-in-class. So, without going into specifics, we're there to take advantage of the secular trend, and we'll
continue to innovate and solve for our clients' needs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe if I could word it a little differently. The strong ETF growth that you have seen this
quarter, is the revenue fully reflected this quarter? Or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to
come?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I would say it's the latter. It's generally speaking, strong pipeline, we're always adding new clients to the platform.
And because of the size of what's being onboarded, they tend to do it in a phased approach. So, some revenue is
on the platform, some revenue to come.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Excellent. Thanks. Thanks for that, Dermot. Thank you also for the update on NII, encouraging to see things
working better. Could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut? And given that
we're seeing rates coming down now, is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here?

So, the betas, I think we've said on previous calls, we view it as symmetrical. So, for us, the first rate cut was
100% passed on. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of where we are in the Fed easing cycle, I
think it's probably a little bit too early to see how that's going to feed into the deposit balance story.
I think overall, we've held in there. We had a strong Q3 for a variety of different reasons. So, I would say, I expect
where we are to moderate a little bit on balances in Q4, and we will see what happens next with the next Fed
meeting, but no significant change for us as we sit here right here today.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Hey, how are you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Mike, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good. That's a big number, the $50 trillion of AUC, a nice round number. It's factual that you beat expectations for
the quarter and the year so far as you highlighted. I'm just trying to figure out, how much of this is lucky versus
being smart? And I imagine it's a bit of both, but the lucky part is: record stock market, volatility, trading, some
other factors in the market that have gone your way.
And I don't feel like we have enough information on your client growth, the underlying client growth, the most
repeatable part of the company. So, could you give some color on whether it's growth in clients or maybe it's
revenues per client or maybe it's products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about, how
you're managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Mike. It's Robin. I understand the question, and it's obviously a very legit question. We broke through the
$50 trillion. By the way, we ended at $52 trillion. So, the good news is we didn't stop at the round number.
I'd say that it isn't just fashionable. It's actually old-fashioned, traditional, just the way that we want to do it in terms
of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus. And so, we've tried to provide as much visibility as we
reasonably can into the inputs of what it is that's ultimately driving this progress, because we understand we have
benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets. And of course, it's part of our business, to be able to be
well-positioned to take advantage of those backdrops.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
We've got parts of our business which respond to asset values. We've got parts of our business that respond to
the number of accounts. We've got parts of our business that respond to software sales, transaction volumes. And
having that multifaceted set of business response functions, if you want to call it, that is actually a deliberate
strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets.
And so, if you believe that overall debt issued in the world, equity valuations in the world, financial market
activities are going to grow, we're trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends. We think that's good.
Having said that, to the heart of your question, this is the work that we've really done in the early days since this
management team took over, which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to
understand how they could work together, so they could hum together, in order to be able to unlock more
potential.
And so, we rallied to the firm around three strategic pillars. This thing of Being More for Our Clients and that's not
just words. It's been about maturing this one-BNY philosophy that we've talked before about; it's about having a
different type of dialogue; it's about the movement overtime to solutions, as opposed to just products. It's like the
examples that I gave and Dermot gave in our prepared remarks, where clients are coming to us, because we can
do more than one thing for them. And it's not just that we're selling more things to them. It's that they actually want
to take advantage of bundles of things, which actually provide a better solution to their business.
And then, our second pillar of Running the Company Better, that's been about sales rhythms and sales targets
and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is that we're trying to do. And then wrapping
the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture, wanting to push forward, wanting to make BNY
of the future, more than BNY Mellon was of the past. And those things are all quite deliberate, and we believe that
we're starting to see the results of that, although it's still early, in our results. But Dermot can give you a couple of
additional things on this, which I think also would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, Mike, from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective, we're up 5% year-on-year in fee growth.
Constructive markets. And so, we've been able to take advantage of constructive markets, but a couple of
important points that I would draw out, is that, in all three of our business segments, we've seen solid underlying
growth.
And in Robin's prepared remarks, he talked about the fact that we're evolving into a platform company. And when
we have platforms that we're investing in, at scale, so when you have high volume and you have constructive
markets, we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that.
Asset Servicing, we're winning and onboarding new business. We came into the year with a backlog. We
onboarded the business throughout the year, and we're beginning to go into the Q4 with a bigger backlog than we
came into the beginning of the year. So, Asset Servicing, I feel very proud of.
Corporate Trust, Depositary Receipts. Corporate Trust, specifically, a good margin business, but something that
had been devoid of investment over a number of years, and we've put money to work there, in terms of leadership
and scaling our technology, and that's going to be an important business for us in the future. And Treasury
Services and Clearance and Collateral Management have really shown, when you have a scale platform with high
volume, strong markets, lots of issuance, lots of payments, you take advantage of that.

And then on just the client-specific thing, albeit it's a small base, we've highlighted a couple of transactions this
year where we're able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients, and clients are now buying
from us across more than one line of business, in some cases, four lines of business. That was something that we
just could not do a couple of years ago. And Robin's point about bringing the one-BNY to bear on clients is really
beginning to pay dividends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Well, that was very comprehensive. Just last follow-up, are you implying – and by the way, on all the
metrics, again, the client growth numbers are what – and thanks for peeling back the layers of the onion there, but
always like even more layers, never enough for us, but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going
down the line.
But the expenses clearly, Dermot, the flat expenses that's very clear on that part of it. Are you implying even lower
expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, look, the thing I would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we work really hard over the last
couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base, and we guided flat at the
beginning of the year.
And broadly speaking, there's been some pressure, I would say, on expenses that for the most part are revenue-
related. And so, if revenues are higher, there are some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses. So,
while I've guided roughly flat for the full year, there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because
of higher revenues.
And also, as Robin said in his remarks, we've announced the acquisition of Archer, and there will be some
integration costs associated with that. But I feel very good the fact that now we have 53,000 people who
understand the importance of financial discipline, and that goes to pillar number two of being a really well-run
company.

Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just sticking with the revenue
dynamic, talking about the opportunity, the Commercial Liftoff and the enterprise approach. The early traction that
you're getting, I think you referenced some clients now doing multiple services. Can you talk a little bit more about
how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory?

And then, also, if you can reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets. I think it was like 10% equity
market moves can have impact of about 1% revenue. So, I wanted to sort of break apart those two dynamics,
really showing that you're actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, if I take the last question first, hopefully, that was your two questions in one go. So, 5% gradual change in
equity markets is roughly $60 million in fees, annually, and a 5% gradual change in fixed income markets is
roughly $40 million in fees, annually.
So that's a little bit on the sensitivity analysis. And so, on the Commercial Liftoff that Robin talked about in his
remarks, it really is Cathinka Wahlstrom who's with us now for over a year. Spent the first year really on a
listening tour and organizing roughly our 1,200 to 1,500 leading client coverage people around the world in terms
of what we want our ambition to be, what are the products that we have, and how can we educate our total force
to be able to be out there with clients delivering the whole of the firm. I think, and also if you talk about Archer for
a second, I think a couple of years ago, if we were to do that acquisition, one part of the firm would have bought it
for its business.
And I think Robin's point in his remarks are really, really important where you buy it once, you use it multiple
times, and it's an acquisition that's done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business. And that's how
you should think about how our Client Coverage Model is going to work in a strategic way going forward.
We're going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients. Clients have a better understanding of the diversified
nature of our business franchise, and they're just buying more from us. And it's just going to show up in revenue,
and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for Q4 and the
opportunities that are going to come our way in 2025.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee and a bigger
picture question. When you guys think about a number of different growth areas – you outlined some of the
specifics – and obviously, the approach to cross-selling has taken a whole different turn here. So, when you zoom
out and you look at the business holistically, how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise
can generate over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, we don't guide on fees, I haven't done – don't intend to do it here. But what I would say is, and I gave this
answer at an earlier question, we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments. Our
underlying organic growth this year, we feel quite happy about, and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of
the year. And there's no reason to expect that, that momentum won't continue.

And I do feel the way we've set up for the back half of this year and into next year, it's a flywheel of innovation,
and we have a lot of growth initiatives. And we've come together, and we have a group of people who are working
on what we call Integrated Solutions. And so, we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline. Robin talked
about Alts Bridge in his remarks, talked about Archer in his remarks. There are things that we're doing within
specific lines of business coming together. We talked about Pershing being realigned into Clearance and
Collateral Management and that's driving growth as well.
So, the decisions that we've taken over the last couple of years, in terms of realigning certain activities into
different parts of the firm, are showing up in our revenues this year, and we will continue to do that into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And Alex, I'd just add, Dermot really alluded to this in what he just said. But right from the beginning, we've had
two approaches. One is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing BNY's potential as a multi-year endeavor,
and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years.
And North Star, as you know, for us, is operating leverage. And that came about in a slightly different way in 2023
than it did in 2024, and it could be different again in 2025 as we really get into that conversation ultimately when
we talk to you in January. But we've simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the
shorter-term and for the medium-term and for the longer-term.
And so, both Dermot and I have talked about this Platforms Operating Model. That's a great example. There have
been some benefits that come early on in that process. We brought like things together across the company.
There have been benefits on the revenue side. There have been benefits on the expense side from doing it. But
then the value of having done it creates medium term momentum because now we're able to be more dynamic for
clients.
We're able to solve problems more quickly for clients. And so, there's a payoff there. And then over the longer-
term, it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that Dermot was just talking about.
And again, there's a revenue story there. But there's also an expense story. And that's how we're thinking about it,
notwithstanding we haven't given you a specific growth target number. Make no mistake, we're invested in
creating that growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. No, fair enough. I appreciate all that. Smaller kind of tactical question for you guys. So, the repo activity
continued to be quite elevated, and you mentioned that in your prepared remark as well. Is it possible to help size
how much repo contributed across the enterprise? It hits you in a couple of different ways. Obviously, there's the
NII benefit and there's some fee benefit. So, as you think about the more normalized level of repo activity versus
what you saw in the quarter, how big of a contributor was that in totality?
And as you look forward, given changes in monetary policy expectations, but also some of the client behavior that
you mentioned earlier, how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
So, on the repo question, so a cleared repo, for sure, we saw elevated activity, particularly going into the back
end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter. And that in large part contributed to the outperformance for
the Q3 NII. That has now moderated somewhat. And so, in my prepared remarks and in terms of the guidance,
that's why I kind of feel like roughly for NII, we're about a $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In terms of cleared repo
overall as a kind of contributor to the NII over the course of the year, it's roughly about 5% of the number.
As it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity, I think from what we see on our platforms, we see
that continuing to be the case. In the medium term, there's no reason for the slowdown. It's been a very strong
year, very, very active client engagement, product innovation. And particularly on the international side, we said at
the beginning of the year in our strategic call in January that international was going to be a key area of focus on
the platform. And that's been the case. And that's shown up in the results.
So, I think overall, and I said in my prepared remarks as well, in terms of the liquidity ecosystem, in total, hit a
high for us at $1.5 trillion. That's up from $1.2 trillion a couple of years ago, and that's in the backdrop of liquidity
coming out of the system. So, we've grown quite substantially, and that again is coming back to connecting the
dots across the firm, getting teams collaborating more, being more digital, providing innovative solutions to clients,
and that is really powering the growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
If I could just relate that back to a question that Mike had asked earlier on, because I think these things are
relevant. You got to remember that the strategy of us, having roughly the right oars in roughly the right waters, to
be able to participate in things that are happening in the world, that's very important. So, if I just supplement what
Dermot said, with the additional observation that we're the world's largest securities lender that generates repo
activity. We're the world's largest collateral manager, so we get to capture fees associated with people during
repo. We obviously play this role in the US Treasury market, which participates in the growth of US Treasury
repo.
We have all of these different touch points. And so, there are different ways in which we can collect across
software, in some cases, services that we administer in others, and participation in different, both global markets
and also product types, which align in indirect ways to that. So, that's an important part of how we look at the
overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those, and we can
participate in the benefit of that growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

acquisition you accomplished in this quarter. What your outlook is for – you're obviously at very strong capital

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Gerard. First of all, just make a quick comment about Archer, we're looking forward to closing that
transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in. And this relates a little bit to a couple of other things
that we've already talked about on the call. One is participation in markets and the other one earlier on, on ETFs,
if you just think about the way that we view the world construct, once upon a time there were mutual funds. More
recently in the past decade or so, it's really been the explosion of ETFs.
And there's a simultaneous thing going on, which is the growth of separately managed accounts. And so, in the
same way that Dermot described how we've participated in outsized participation of the ETF migration, Archer is a
transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the
transition to separately managed accounts. So, it relates to that strategic question, of growth and participating in
different markets that we talked about.
Now, stepping back to the other part of your question, really, the heart of it on M&A. Now look, our primary focus
is what we have and how we can improve on it. And Dermot and I both talk a lot about the fact that we've looked
very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses. We think we have a great set of businesses. We
think they are great ones to be in and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other. And we think that
the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients and more joined-up way of solutions than
maybe we have before. So, it isn't that we do M&A from a position in any way of needing to do things. It's – we're
able to be very opportunistic, and we obviously like that a lot.
But notwithstanding that we're pleased with what we have, we don't want to be complacent. So, we keep our eyes
open, and we look at things and Archer came about, as a result of a strategic business review that we did
internally, looking at long-term trends, looking at how we might adapt to those trends. And then we went out and
we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that, with the key emphasis being on the word capability
– digestible, bolt-on things that accelerate what we're trying to do or de-risk delivery of what we're trying to do.
And if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves,
with a great team, great technology, ideally like this one, an installed book of business is also helpful. Then we
feel very good about it.
As long as it aligns with those priorities, is a good cultural fit, has a good attractive return. So, that's our M&A
thought process. And then if that fits into the overall waterfall, which we've talked about before, which is if we have
excess capital, we're going to, of course, be prudent, and so we like excess capital. That's not a bad thing in an
uncertain world.
And so that's a very important consideration. Then we look at whether or not we could invest it. Good news, as
you know, we're a pretty capital-light model, we're very capital generative. So, we don't need a ton of capital to
reinvest in our business to keep growing it. Then we look at whether or not we need something – for some type of
additional need, like the Archer, example, and then we distribute the rest.
And this has been obviously a good year to see all of that on display. We've been prudent. We've run at elevated
capital levels and as Dermot has indicated, we intend to return 100% plus of net earnings to shareholders, and
we've been able to make an acquisition. And so, this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the
world.

Very good. Thank you for the answer. And then just as a quick follow-up, Dermot, you gave us that sensitivity
analysis about a gradual 5% change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on
revenue. Was that for up markets, meaning the gradual increase was 5% up? Does that also reflect a down
market, if markets were down 5%, that's the kind of impact we would expect to see?

I had a follow-up to some of your responses. I think, I guess, depending how – maybe starting with this capital
allocation. So, heard your response to Gerard's question around M&A and such. But just talk to us – when we
think about the valuation of the stock on price-to-earnings, price-to-tangible book, at the same time, this year has
been pretty good market backdrop-wise, and as an investor, shareholder, you care about ROE resiliency of these
firms. So, one maybe, Robin, Dermot, talk to us about your comfort around ROE resiliency? If the market
backdrop is unfavorable, what's the flex in the system? And given where things stand today, how do you think
about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100%-plus in buybacks and dividends? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I'll take the second bit first, and then Dermot will reflect on the first part of your question. So, the good news is that
we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock, and we
appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction, we believe in ourselves
as well. And so, while we do, of course, consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return
framework. We don't view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Ebrahim, when I took on the role a couple of years ago, I guess I got a lot of questions about is this just going to
be more of the same or what's different? And now we're several quarters into the new team, and Robin has really
bolstered that team, and through the strategic pillars, communication, the principles, the medium-term financial
targets – has really started to evolve the culture of BNY. And so, it is our commitment to deliver to our
shareholders positive operating leverage through the cycle.
And so, if you just take a step back and look at this quarter's financials, 5% revenue growth, flat expense growth,
33% pre-tax margin, upper end of Tier 1 leverage 6%, 23% return on tangible common equity, and a 22% EPS
growth, and what I would say is a solid beat. So, I don't really think about the valuation of the firm on any given
day. We just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders. And if we do that in a first-class way, the
valuation will take care of itself.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And you asked about the returns and our sort of comfort with them. Look, we've given medium-term targets, as
Dermot just said, that's sort of greater than or equal to 23% for ROTCE. And so, we obviously appreciate touching
that. But doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets.
And, in terms of the resiliency, remember that the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification.
We talked about the equity market and the fixed income markets. I talked about the fact that it is software, it's
services, platforms, and market valuations, and transaction volumes. These are all that we participate in, capital
markets activity has been important to us in 2024.
The fact that we participate through our Corporate Trust business, through our Debt Capital Markets business,
those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally. We participate in the scale of
markets, and things like the Treasury Market is a good example. And so, this diversification of our mix helps us to
be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle.
Now of course, things will move around, and that's why Dermot mentioned the point about our commitment to
positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine, because we recognize that
NII, which is part of our mix, but so too are the fees and then our ability to control our expenses. We could make
expenses less than they are now. We've chosen to manage them at the level that they are, because we believe
that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the
environment. But it wouldn't always have to be so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Appreciate that. And if I can sneak one quick more follow-up. Dermot, I think you mentioned fourth quarter NII
slightly lower than 3Q. We've seen a few rate cuts in Europe, in the US now into September. Is it fair to assume
that absent a dramatic change in rates, this $1 billion in quarterly NII is kind of where we are bouncing around at
the bottom? And then if deposit growth picks up, QT stops, that it should go off that base, or am I missing
something?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, if you look back at our last five quarters, we've kind of toggled between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Q3 was a
stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons, principally, volatility in the market at the beginning of August and
18


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
clients held more cash. And then towards the back end of the quarter, once there was a clearer view on where the
Fed was going to go at rates, clients started to put money into money market funds, which ended up with us.
And so, we kind of benefited from those two principal things. And so, our deposit balances have leveled off here.
We expect maybe NIBs grind down a little bit from here. And so, as I said maybe 10 minutes ago, $1 billion for Q4
is the best guidance I can give you today. And for 2025, I don't see NII being a headwind for us. And we've taken
extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our CIO book to insulate 2025.

Hi. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hi, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Two quick questions. One is on the buyback question, and I know you said, you're very accretive, earnings
accretion, you don't need a lot of capital for the business model, of course, as we know, and you're above your
target CET1 of 11% and Tier 1 leverage, target 5.5% to 6%, you're at the high-end of that range.
And so, when we think about the 100% plus, how should we think about the "plus" part of the 100% plus?
Because it feels like totally 100% makes sense, but there's room to bring these to optimize the capital structure
more. I'm wondering, what kind of timeframe are we talking about to optimize your capital structure do you feel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, thanks for the question, Betsy. Last year, we returned a little north of 120%. This year, in January, we guided
100% or more, given the uncertainty in the markets, geopolitical, the US presidential elections, a wide range of
uncertainty with Fed.
In January, we thought the year was going to be very different to where it's ended up. And I think on previous
calls, we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is the 6% range.
And so when you take that and the Archer transaction, we kind of think we're still on track to do the 100% or
more. Through three quarters, we're at 103%. So, I wouldn't expect that to materially change from here.

Okay. Got it. And then the other question is you mentioned one-third of BNY is now on the Platform Model. And
are you taking 100% of the firm there? And just wondering about implications for a runway for efficiency
improvements as you execute on that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, a quarter of the firm, roughly 13,000 employees are on the platform now. Happened in two waves, March and
September with another wave going live in Q1 of next year. And so, I wouldn't necessarily think about Platforms
Operating Model as a mechanism just for efficiency. It's going to drive top-line growth and is going to run the
company better and it's going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joined-up thinking. So, it really is
the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars.
And so, the answer to the question about 100% is yes. And from here, it's probably another 18-months before the
firm is fully up there. But by the end of Q1 of next year, we expect about half the firm will be live on the model.
And the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive. So, it's really worked well for
us as a firm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And Betsy, remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18-month point because sometimes it's not until
folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that they're really able to examine some of the core
questions that, that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize. So, we expect the benefit that Dermot
was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18-month point.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hello. Just one wrap-up for me. Dermot, I love that you pointed out the 5% revenue growth, flattish expenses lead
to 20% earnings growth. That is the power of the BK model. If you look just – I know it's just one quarter, but if you
look at the sequential numbers, the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little
bit. All I'm asking is, does that inform us in any way, of how we're looking at as we roll into 2025? A lot of your
business metrics and balance and client wins are up. So, my gut is it's no, but I just want to see from that
perspective, how you feel about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, I think your gut is correct. It is no, Glenn, and it's all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put
people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized. So, just in terms of the backlog across all
our businesses, strong pipeline continues to grow. And yeah, so your intuition is correct.

decline? And is it competitive takeaways or something else that's driving that? Thanks.

So, I wouldn't really read too much into that. We've talked about that for several years about the sponsored
program going away and not being around. It's still here. Depositary Receipts is a small business, in the totality of
it, but it is a very, very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients,
and it has got a very good margin to it, and we have very significant market share in that business. So, it's
something that we continue to invest in. We think it's very important for our franchise, and we don't see a secular
decline in that business from where we see it today.

Robin Antony Vince A

We also off-boarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business. So, the headline of total number is a
little bit misleading – if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline,
you'd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on the margins. You're mostly at your 33% target in most
areas. So, as you generate more saves from moving to the Platform Model, and as we move into, say, next year
or beyond, I guess, what's the view on spending some of that in investing in the business versus actually
generating potentially generating margins well above 33%.

Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Committee, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, my answer to that one would be, we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver 33%
margins through the cycle. We gave guidance for the first time in January, and then we just managed to get there
pretty quickly. But we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time.
We're heading into what's going to be quite an interesting budget season for us, because we've done a lot of
great things this year. I know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year. And to offset
that balance, we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. And so, the next eight weeks and how we
set up the firm for next year will inform how we communicate with you in January. But we set out those targets
because we believe we could hit them. The positive is we got there earlier than we thought. And now we want to
show that we can improve and maintain those margins that we've guided to previously.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Antony Vince A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And Brian, the best clue I could give you in terms of how we think about that, in sort of a little bit more detail is if
you actually look at us on a segment-by-segment basis, you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage
journey differently in our three segments. And we told you a year or so ago that, that's what we were going to do.
And so maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment, if you look at Market and Wealth
Services, we aren't trying to grow the margin there. We're very happy with the margin. We just wanted to grow the
total size of the business, which is exactly what we've been doing.
There are the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our medium-term
targets for those segments. There, we are really growing the margin. And so you can see exactly your question at
work in our segments.

Yes. That's great color. Thank you very much.

Hi, with all this talk of the transitioning of the employees, I guess, half the employees to the new platform over the
next one to two years, how much do you see AI playing a role? And can you give any metrics? I mean keeping
expenses flat, I don't know how much you're still investing in AI. When Emily presented at the Boston bank
conference last November, it seemed like BNY was all in for AI. It was one of the most bullish cases made, yet
you've heard out in the broader world, sometimes you have hits, sometimes you have misses. So where – how
does AI relate to the whole platform strategy? And how committed are you to AI? And do you have any numbers
that you can give us, some concrete metrics? Thanks.

Sure. So just to reiterate, we've got a quarter of our people in the Platforms Operating Model. And as Dermot
said, it's sort of an 18-month trajectory from here. That's really, Mike, the way I think about Platforms Operating
Model is this concept of if you take it that we are in fact, more and more a platforms company in terms of these
large at-scale capabilities, often software and services that we deliver, generally in market-leading positions,
number one in a variety of different markets. We've talked about things – the businesses before, I won't repeat
them. Then, it follows to us from that that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a Platforms Operating
Model, which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operate themselves. And so that is a
strategy around how we organize ourselves in being pursuant to our broader strategy.
Now AI – which is, of course, part of that, we have an AI Hub. We have a couple of hundred people in that AI
Hub, and we are absolutely investing in AI and do believe in the power of AI to be able to help our business in
terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and
efficient. And we haven't made a lot of noise about it, but don't misunderstand that for a lack of interest or
investment, because we haven't slowed down. In fact, we've increased our AI investment.
And of course, notwithstanding all of that, you can see that from running the company well on an expense line,
we're not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management. And this is
where, I don't mean to be pithy, but it's very, very important learning for us is that we, as a company, can walk
and chew gum at the same time. We can invest in things that matter, and we can manage the company well. We
make choices, and AI is a choice of something we're leaning into, and we think that's important for the future.
