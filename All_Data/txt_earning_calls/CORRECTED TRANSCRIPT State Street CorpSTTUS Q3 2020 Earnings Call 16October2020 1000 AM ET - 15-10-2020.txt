Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene; and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter and year-to-date
financial results. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our team members worldwide who continue to put our
clients first and deliver strong results for our shareholders in these extraordinary times.
Turning to page 3. Our vision is clear and remains that of becoming the leading services and data insight provider
to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Despite the challenges of the current operating environment,
we continue our strategic pivot in investment services from being primarily a fund servicer to being an enterprise
outsource provider, further enabled by our differentiated State Street Alpha platform. We are forging ahead with
the implementation of our strategy, developing new business opportunities and continuing to drive productivity
improvements.
As we successfully navigate the COVID-19 environment, we are operating against four priorities: One, delivering
growth through deeper client engagement; two, improving our product performance and innovating; three, driving
3

efficiencies to improve productivity and optimization; and four, supporting the financial system and planning ahead
for our team members.
I will provide you a short update on each of these areas before moving onto our results. First, our clients are at
the center of everything we do. This year, we have proven that as a result of our strong operational capabilities,
we are able to effectively and efficiently onboard new clients and install new assets in even the most volatile of
market environments. And we continue to see proof points of our operational excellence.
For example, this quarter, we successfully installed approximately $800 billion of investment servicing assets.
This was accomplished while also driving sales and expanding the pipeline, as demonstrated by the strong level
of new investment servicing wins this quarter, which amounted to $249 billion. Our front-to-back Alpha platform
drove approximately one-third of these wins. Of note, included in these wins was a front-to-back CRD middle
office and core custody mandate with a large European asset manager that was not a pre-existing client
relationship.
Also, despite the challenges we continued to expand in critical growth markets, with the opening of a new office in
Saudi Arabia to support our growing opportunities in the Middle East. Lastly, we continue to win new business
and maintain a strong pipeline at CRD, where this quarter, we more than doubled new bookings, both year-over-
year and quarter-over-quarter.
The institutional investor market is experiencing significant disruption. Our clients are facing increased pressures
to effectively employ data to achieve better investment outcomes and drive efficiencies within their operating
models. We are positioning ourselves strategically to meet our clients' needs and help them with their own
strategic pivot.
Second, product differentiation and innovation are critical elements of how we are driving revenue growth across
the franchise. Clients continue to turn to State Street for our comprehensive and differentiated servicing
capabilities. For example, we recently launched our new NAV Insights product to for our hedge fund clients.
Elsewhere, the open architecture and interoperability of our platform will enable us to expand our capabilities and
attract new clients by partnering with other service providers, such as our recently announced partnership with
SimCorp for the insurance segment in EMEA.
At Global Advisors, where assets under management reached a record level of $3.1 trillion this quarter, we
continue to expand our product offering, including expanding our range of fixed income ETFs.
Third, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen
our operating model and achieve cost efficiencies, even during this challenging period.
Company-wide productivity and efficiency efforts in just the first nine months of 2020 have so far achieved gross
savings of 5% of our 2019 year-to-date total expense base, excluding notable items, as we continue to gain
efficiencies through IT optimization as well as other measures.
The efficiencies we gain from the optimization of our business model to-date are enabling both margin expansion
and further investments to support our operations, client needs and technology innovation, including our ongoing
investments in CRD and our Alpha platform.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Last, throughout this crisis, State Street has supported the financial markets and our employees. Our human
capital is critically important to our success. We have safely reopened most of our office locations across the
world and have brought back critical functions that operate more effectively, full or part time, in office, though most
of our workforce remains work from home.
At the same time, we are planning for the post-pandemic workplace of the future. We believe that enabling better
productivity, innovation and fostering cultural attributes that set us apart are critical to our success.
As many of you know, Global Advisors has long been a leader in its stewardship efforts and its focus on diversity
and good governance with portfolio companies. We are also addressing racial and social injustice by improving
the diversity inclusion within our own organization and advocating for the same in our industry. This is critically
important to our leadership team, and we are taking a number of concrete actions in reducing these injustices,
including 10 specific actions we have committed to executing, which I encourage you to review on our website.
Turning to slide 4, we present our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance highlights. You will see that
as we continue to implement our strategy and improve our productivity, these actions are bearing fruit.
First, looking at our third quarter results relative to the prior-year period, total revenue decreased 4%, largely
driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%,
demonstrating the progress we are making as we work to reignite fee revenue growth as well as the year-over-
year contribution from CRD.
Turning to expenses. Here, again, I am pleased to report that as a result of our continued productivity
improvements, we have reduced both third quarter and year-to-date expenses by 2%, excluding notable items.
Productivity management is now a way of life for us, and we will continue to build on this strong culture of
expense management we have successfully established.
On a year-to-date basis and excluding notable items, we have driven 3 percentage points of positive operating
leverage, improved our pre-tax margin by 1.3 percentage points, and generated 19% of EPS growth, relative to
the year-ago period. We have achieved these improved results in a very challenging operating environment,
particularly the low interest rate environment that I just mentioned.
Lastly, reflective of our business model, our balance sheet and capital position are strong, and we continue to
operate with capital levels well in excess of our regulatory requirements. As we await the outcome of the latest
Federal Reserve stress test in the fourth quarter, given our strong capital levels and unique business model, we
are considering a full range of capital return actions, in line with Federal Reserve instructions and market
conditions.
To conclude, despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we are navigating it well. We are
implementing our differentiated front-to-back Alpha strategy, developing new business opportunities, and
continuing to improve our operating model, thereby driving productivity improvements.
I am pleased that our third quarter and year-to-date performance demonstrate this and how we are making
measurable progress in improving State Street's financial performance.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Eric W. Aboaf
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. To begin my review of our 3Q 2020 results, I'll start on slide 5. As
you can see on the top-left panel, during the third quarter, we recorded good growth in both servicing and
management fees. Our expense discipline continues to bear fruit, too, with total expenses down 4% year-on-year
and 2% ex-notables.
On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see two notable items, including a small legal release this quarter.
Separately, and for comparison purposes only, we have also called out some of the noteworthy impacts within
NII, which I will discuss more – in more detail shortly.
Turning to slide 6. Period-end AUC/A increased 11% year-over-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to a record $36.6
trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period-end market levels, client inflows and net new
business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A also increased, the result of higher equity market levels and net new
business installations.
AUM increased 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter to $3.1 trillion, also a record. Relative to the year-ago
period, the increase was primarily driven by higher period-end market levels coupled with net ETF inflows, offset
by some institutional net outflows. Our SPDR Gold ETF continued to perform strongly, generating $6 billion in net
inflows this quarter and taking in a record $23 billion year-to-date.
Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased mainly due to higher period-end market levels, partially offset by cash net
outflows as very strong inflows during the first half of the year reversed with the recent risk-on sentiment.
Turning to slide 7. Third quarter servicing fees increased 2% year-on-year, including FX, reflecting higher average
market levels, increased amounts of client activity and net new business, only partially offset by pricing
headwinds, which continue to moderate.
Servicing fees were also up 2% relative to the second quarter, including the effects of FX, driven by higher
average market levels, partially offset by a sequential normalization of previously elevated client activity.
As a result of our commitment to clients and our strong operational capabilities, we have continued to close deals
and successfully onboard new client business throughout this pandemic. On the bottom left of the slide, we
summarize the statistics.
On the bottom right panel, we summarize the actions we're taking to further ignite growth. In 2019, you may recall
that we saw servicing fees decline 6% year-over-year, probably as a result of elevated pricing pressure, which is
now moderating.
We quickly intervened by rolling out a client coverage model to our top 50 clients, instilling pricing governance,
launching the new Alpha front-to-back offering, and working more closely with our clients. The result was to not
only stabilize servicing fees, but also begin to drive growth in servicing fee revenues, which are now up 2% year-
on-year and year-to-date.
The next phase is to extend our enhanced sales coverage model to another 150 clients, leveraging both country
and regionally focused segment teams to further develop our pipeline. We think this is worth another couple
percentage points of servicing fee growth over time, as we saw across our top 50 clients.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Turning to slide 8. Let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Beginning with Global
Advisors, third quarter management fees increased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, with the year-
on-year performance largely driven by higher average market levels as well as net ETF and cash inflows, partially
offset by institutional outflows.
For a complete view of our Investment Management segment revenues, we've included a page in the Addendum,
which also includes fees we earn as a marketing agent, as we do for our SPDR Gold ETF, which are booked in
other GAAP lines. All-in, total Investment Management segment fee revenues increased 5% year-on-year and 7%
quarter-on-quarter; and the business segment margin reached 29% this quarter.
With the third quarter complete, we anticipate that the likely impact of money market fee waivers net of distribution
expense will be within the previously announced $10 million to $15 million range for full-year 2020.
Turning to our FX trading services, third quarter results were up 4% year-on-year, but were down 15% quarter-on-
quarter as we saw the second quarter bump recede. Securities finance revenue decreased 28% year-on-year
primarily driven by lower client balances and lower agency reinvestment yields affecting the industry. Securities
finance revenue was down 9% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of those lower yields. Finally, third quarter
software and processing fees increased 21% year-on-year, or 30% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by
CRD, which I'll turn to next, as well as market-related adjustments.
Moving to slide 9, we show a view of CRD's business performance and revenue growth. As you can see, we have
separated CRD revenues into three categories: On-premise; professional services; and software-enabled
revenues. The slide illustrates the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the 606 [ASC 606] revenue recognition
accounting standards for on-prem, and more importantly, demonstrates the consistent growth in the more
predictable streams of software-as-a-service and professional services revenues.
As a reminder, second quarter's CRD's standalone revenue of $145 million was primarily driven by a large wealth
on-prem implementation and several large asset manager renewals. This quarter CRD's standalone revenue was
a more normalized $99 million. Looking over a broader time horizon, you can see that total revenue, as well as
the SaaS and professional fee revenue growth are strong, up 16% and 20%, respectively. As we continue to
invest in and expand the CRD platform, we are seeing good momentum in the business and we now expect full-
year CRD standalone revenue growth to be in the low-double digits.
Turning to slide 10. Third quarter NII declined 26% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the
impact of episodic and true-ups, NII was down 20% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. As a reminder, the
year-ago period included approximately $20 million of episodic market-related benefits related to the FX swap
mark-to-market and hedge effectiveness.
This quarter's NII included a negative true-up as we recognized approximately $20 million from OCI to net interest
expense related to the prior-period transfers of securities from AFS to HTM. Year-on-year, the change in NII was
primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the impact of these two items, partially offset by larger
investment portfolio and loan balances.
Relative to the second quarter, the decline in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the roll
off of MMLF balances and this quarter's true-up, partially offset by a $5 billion expansion of the core investment
portfolio which was worth about $10 million of additional revenues.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
On the right-hand side of the slide, we show our end-of-period and average balance sheet trends. We currently
expect to operate at around $190 billion of average deposits, though that may actually increase, given the Fed's
continued expansion of the money supply. As a result, this puts us in a position to continue to consciously expand
the investment portfolio in the coming quarters to mitigate the effect of the low rate environment.
On slide 11, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex-notables, so that the underlying
trends are readily visible. 3Q 2020 expenses were down 2% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter,
excluding notable items, but including the impact of FX.
As we continue to concentrate on driving productivity improvements and cost management in a challenging
environment, we reduced expenses across four or five GAAP lines: Comp and benefits; transaction processing;
occupancy, and other, relative to the year-ago period. Infosys [information systems] costs remain lumpy, but we
continue to focus on technology optimization and are making good progress.
On a year-to-date basis total expenses are down 2% ex-notables relative to the year-ago period, demonstrating
the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model, as we reduce gross expenses by about 5
percentage points, which is partially offset by natural growth and reinvestment of approximately 3 points.
Moving to slide 12, in the left panel, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio. Investment
portfolio increased to $112 billion, as we thoughtfully put more client deposits to work, even as MMLF securities
continue to run off as anticipated. You will see that we continue to maintain a high percentage of HQLA assets.
And as the short-dated MMLF securities matured, the average duration of portfolio extended to almost three years
at period end.
In the right panel, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to
navigate this challenging operating environment with strong and elevated capital levels. As of quarter end, our
standardized CET1 ratio increased by 10 basis points, quarter-on-quarter, the 12.4%, driven by solid retained
earnings only partially offset by modestly higher risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 leverage ratio was improved by 50
basis points to 6.6% as a result of our higher retained earnings and lower average assets.
Consistent with the restrictions imposed on large banks by the Federal Reserve, we made no common share
repurchases in the third quarter and cannot do any in the fourth. As Ron noted, we are confident in our strong and
elevated capital position. And we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share
repurchases in upcoming quarters when regulatory and market conditions allow.
Turning to slide 13, we've again provided a summary of our 3Q 2020 and year-to-date performance. Our third
quarter results reflect our focus on not only stabilizing but also reigniting fee growth, as well as the obvious
headwinds from the low interest rate environment. Both our third quarter and our year-to-date results show clear
evidence of how we're successfully executing on our strategy to improve State Street's financial performance and
create shareholder value, all the while temporarily holding elevated capital well above our regulatory
requirements.
Turning to the rest of the year outlook. Throughout the pandemic, I've discussed our outlook under a certain set of
assumptions. Now, with three quarters of the year behind us, let me share with you our current thinking, but with
the caveat that the macroeconomic environment could continue to change.
We expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels and long-end rates will stay at current spot
rates through year-end. We also assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of 2020 will
8

be flat to current levels. With that backdrop, we now expect that full-year 2020 fee revenue will be up
approximately 2.5% to 3%, with servicing fees expected to be up approximately 2% for full year, both of which are
up from our previous guide. Regarding NII, given the impact of continued lower long-end rates, we still expect full
year NII to be down approximately 15%, in line with our previous guidance.
Turning to expenses, we have successfully transformed the expense base and remain laser focused on driving
sustainable productivity improvements and operational efficiencies. We therefore still expect that full-year
expenses will be down 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to find ways to reduce
expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving
economic conditions and any credit quality changes. On taxes, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year
to be at the low end of our 11% to 19% range.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.

So, it's good to see the consistent and good new business growth. And I know that we get that on the gross basis
all the time, but it looks good enough to be very positive on a net basis. I don't know if I can get you to comment
on that. But the follow-on question that I have is, it's also good to see the pricing moderation over the last couple
of quarters in your conversation.
The question I have is, how do you know how durable that is, meaning, how much of the growth has gone through
it, the confidence in what the Pricing Committee is doing, the next 150 client? And then, can clients just stick you

up next year or two? I'd love to get just the overall feeling of confidence that we can keep this trend going in the
right direction. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Glenn, it's Eric. Let me start on pricing, and then we can cover the broader topics of pipeline and momentum. I
think, on pricing, we continue to feel that the actions we took, right, literally, centralizing and turning pricing into a
very senior conversation internally here – and management process, for one, have made a real difference in a
practical way.
And so while, you turn back the clock and you see that historically, this industry has always had some pricing
compression, literally, because there's always appreciation in our fees to the markets, right, so there is always a
natural balance that we lay out with client. That history was in the in the range of 2% per year. We saw that
expand to a 3% and 4% headwind last year, which obviously was not something that we want to or expect to
repeat. This year, we thought that it would be down to 3%, and we updated our view that it'll be down at around
2.5% for the year. And I think that the perspective that we have is that, that is largely due to a more heightened
set of actions, governance, education, to be honest, both of our team and clients.
I think what happens next, time will tell. But I think there is not only the continuation of our intensity and actions
here. But I think the other feature is that as our value proposition offering, that kind of front-to-back offering, which
connects the Charles River, the middle office, the custody and accounting, becomes a bigger part of what we
offer.
Those contracts tend to be longer, they tend to be more integrated, they tend to be stickier, and we think that's
going to continue to provide some support to the pricing benefits that we've accrued and at least keep us at this
level. If we can do better, let me tell you, we'll lean hard into that, but I think we're confident where we've gotten to
and operating in this area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. So, I couldn't get you on the net new business. That's cool. Maybe, Ron, last one from me is, you
mentioned, considering the full range of capital return options, which is cool. You've got a lot of capital to consider
options on.
You particularly have had a good long history in consolidation on the asset management side. I'm just curious,
your take or observation in what's going on in the industry, and if there is room for State Street to participate, not
that you're already a huge player? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I mean, your observation is accurate. There's a heightened amount of consolidation going on. We think
about it from two dimensions, not just as an asset manager, but also as a servicer to asset managers. So it's
something that we're looking at carefully. We're always looking at our two businesses, Investment Services (sic)
[Investment Servicing] and Investment Management, and trying to determine how we best optimize them. And we
like what we have, but to the extent to which we could add to it through some kind of a tuck-in, we'll consider that
also.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody. So, Ron, just maybe building on that last point around
pickup in asset management industry M&A. Obviously, Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley, and there's been
speculations that there could be others. How do you think about that from a service provider perspective?
Obviously, on the one hand, I could see how they could be a net positive, given you guys are kind of any sweet
spot, with sort of large global kind of giants as you described them in the past. So, perhaps maybe more volume,
but pricing could come under pressure given kind of the benefits of the larger platforms.
So, how do we think about that? Is that a net positive or net negative for State Street that we see more
consolidation in the asset management space? And then specifically with respect to Eaton Vance and Morgan
Stanley, any risks or opportunities from the revenue side you guys see for you yourself? I don't know to what
extent you provide services to either.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. So, we're not going to – I'm not going to comment on any specific client situations. It's public that we serve
both of them, but I'm not going to comment on that, Alex. But in terms of the impact on us, there's some
negatives, but there's also a fair number of positives. The negative's obviously would be if we lost the client, or if
we consolidated, but ended up at a different spot on the aggregate fee schedule.
The positives are that, in most of the situations, we often are involved in some way, right from the beginning.
Because of our knowledge of asset managers, our ability to help with operating models, the fact that we now have
this front-to-back Alpha platform, so we're often there at the table, or certainly brought to the table quickly
thereafter.
The other thing that we believe, we can stimulate with all this is if you're going to going through all the integration,
you might as well go through a platform upgrade. And so, we think that, in some ways, this is actually going to
spur activity, because oftentimes, the synergies that are being promised or looked for have to do with the back
office and operations. And you're going to get even more synergies if you actually take the opportunity to overhaul
the operation and have a true front-to-back kind of implementation done. So, positives and negatives, but we
think, over time, probably more positives for us.

Great. Thanks. And the follow-up question for Eric, Ron, NIR. So, just to clarify the down 15% NIR for the full
year, again in line with prior, does that include the $20 million true-up in the quarter? Just sort of – you're talking
about this on a reported basis, which I think implies about $480 million for NIR for Q4. So, just double checking
that. And then more importantly, how do you guys think about that run rate developing into 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Alex, it's Eric. Yeah, we did do it on a reported basis, the 15%. So, I think your estimate of what we're looking at
for fourth quarter is in the right area. I think the way I described this is – first, to describe this year, and then
maybe talk a little bit about next year.
We've clearly been in this interesting environment that fell sharply. And what we're finding is that, at this point,
we're starting to really slow the decline – or the pace of decline of NII quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. And so, you
saw in our results, this quarter, adjusted for the true-up – we'll come back there if necessary – we're down 11%
sequentially.
If you actually just open up the lens and say, how much was NII down first quarter to second quarter? It was down
16%, right. So, we started at 16% 1Q to 2Q. This quarter, we're down 11% on a kind of underlying basis from 2Q
to 3Q. And to your point, if you take our full-year guidance and you've done the math like many others, we're
looking down at around 4, maybe 5 percentage points from 3Q to 4Q. So, you can see that pattern consistently
slowing.
And that's really the effect of the kind of grinds with the portfolio coming through, which slows over time, offset by
our actions to expand the asset side, whether it's loans; the investment portfolio which I said was up $5 billion on
average for the quarter. It's actually up $9 billion on an end-of-period basis. And then, some expansion of what
we're doing in that sponsored repo program. So, those are the puts and the takes.
As we look at next year, it's a little early but our view is that, that pace of reduction continues to slow. And so,
we're probably looking at a couple of percentage points from 4Q into 1Q or 2Q. And then we see some
stabilization at that level. And so, I think you've seen us now really intervene and slow the decline. We'll see
stabilization in 1Q or 2Q. And then, I think, at that point we can offset the grind-down from the portfolio.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on that actually, Eric. The couple of
percentage points from 4Q levels, does that utilize the same underlying assumptions that you laid out initially?
Basically keeping spot rates unchanged? And then, also given the level of importance mortgage-backed
securities have on your portfolio, what assumptions are you making for pre-payment rates? Are you just quoting
those steady? Are you assuming that they ease a little bit? What's embedded there, just so we can calibrate as
we move forward?

Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Brennan. Thanks for that question because each of those assumptions are very important, right. We're
looking for and driving towards an inflection here. So first on rates. I think we're looking at current short rates,
which have become a little more normalized. Remember, we had an inversion between the repo and treasuries,
which now is normalized. So that's slightly beneficial. We're hoping that continues, that stays that way. And long-
end rates in the 70 to 80 basis point range, they've been bouncing a good bit over the last week or so. So that's
the broad assumption.
I think as you think about the assumption on MBS premium amortization and prepayment speeds, we are
assuming that third quarter and fourth quarter are at a more elevated level of prepayments. And then, we do
expect some amount of burnout into first quarter, second quarter and going forward. And so, that is an underlying
assumption. We think that's a fair assumption, given a look at the models. And we obviously get models from the
three or four providers and have our own assessment as well, but it is driven by that.
And then, finally, our performance will be dependent on the pieces that we can control. You've seen us expand
our loan book. Our loan book, which is exceedingly high quality for our clients', is up about 10% year-on-year. You
see our investment portfolio is also up about 10% year-on-year. And our sponsored repo program, we've started
to build the balances now that we've had a little more of a normalization.
And what you're seeing us do there is effectively put more deposits to work. Deposits are up, call it, 20% from the
kind of pre-COVID era. The Fed balance sheet continues to expand. And so, our view is that more of those
deposits can be put to work, whether it's in the loan book, in the investment portfolio over the course of a couple
quarters. And you could see even this quarter I gave you a sense for the difference. It makes a real difference and
it lets us kind of lean in and drive this stabilization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Excellent. Thank you for all that color, Eric. That's great. And then, shifting gears to the Servicing revenue. You
referenced some new business installations. We all saw the sort of rapidity of the equity market rally. And in the
past, sometimes that has resulted in some – the way the Street calculates your servicing fee rate to compress just
because of the mix. Not all of your servicing mandates and contracts are purely based on asset levels.
And so, could you maybe help us unpack a little bit how much of the servicing fee, not going up as much as the
AUC/A, was lags from new business installations where the revenue has not yet come on? And how much of it
might be from the market rally, which naturally would only be partially captured due to some of those contract
dynamics?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Let me, Brennan, take that from a couple different angles, right? Equity markets are clearly a tailwind for
our business, and there's always a little bit of timing, but let's – that's kind of – the timing is really rounding. What's
important really here is the average equity markets and the average equity markets across the globe, right? So if
you step back, S&P is up 12%, 13% year-on-year, but the emerging markets are up. The international, EMEA
markets are actually down a smidge year-over-year. So it's the mix of those that matters.
13


State Street Corp.
(STT) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
And then, not only the EOP matters, but the average matters. And so, kind of on average, year-to-date, we've got
equity markets at up around 6%, which is beneficial, right? We've always talked about equity markets up 10%,
fees up 3%, fixed income markets up 10%, fees up 2%. And so, we do have a tailwind of 1 point, maybe 1.5
points of fees that are coming through on a quarterly basis or year-to-date basis, and we'll take that.
Over and above that, I think we've also got some net new business. And so, to the question I came earlier and
that folks were always asking about, our business wins are outpacing some of the bit of turn that you always get
in the portfolio. And then, we've been able to charge more on a – whether it's client activities or flows have been a
little more positive this year, and those are coming through and offsetting some of the fee headwinds. So I think
there's a good mix, in general.
If equity markets stay at this level, that'll help us with the compares on a year-on-year basis. But remember, third
quarter to fourth quarter of 2019, equity markets were up as well, right? And so, that'll help us on a sequential
basis from 3Q to 4Q. But year-on-year, we're also going to have a tougher comparison there as well 4Q to 4Q.
Anyway, there's a lot there which is partly why I gave the overall fee guide for the year on servicing fees up 2%.
Because we think that's a good indication of a bit of tailwind in equity markets around the globe, but also driven by
our ability to drive new business growth, manage pricing, and then take advantage of some of the flows and
activities that we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Appreciate that, Eric. But just the lag in new business billing versus the AUC coming on, just is there a lag
with some of that? Sometimes there is, and so I just wanted to confirm. Appreciate all that – that's great color on
the market dynamics and the beta, just to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
There is a bit of a lag, but I think the EOP and the averages were relatively consistent for the quarter. And so,
we're not expecting a large lag adjustment into the fourth quarter at this point. There'll be a little bit, but because
of the end of period and the quarterly the average, was pretty consistent. I think it'll just play through more
naturally.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, Eric, just coming back to the capital return question, you have an 8% CET1
minimum. Just wondering if you can just level set us again now that SCB is totally done. We have this stress test
ahead of us and limitation through 4Q. What do you guys see as your limiting capital ratio? And when you are
able to get into buybacks, do you go back to 100% capital return? Or how do you think about like what the actual
excess is over just getting back to a more normal buyback plan?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Ken, it's obviously an important topic we've been working through. In a way, we've been forced to defer any
of those decisions. But I'd tell you, it's one that we're anticipating and eager to act upon, given how strongly
capitalized we are. I used the word elevated capital purposely in my prepared remarks just because that's what
we're running at, right? We've got significant headroom.
I think there's a couple kind of parts to the question you asked. I think, first, in terms of our capital ratio, the
binding constraint, it is now CET1. So core risk-weighted assets divided by common equity Tier 1 capital. At this
point the leverage ratio's not really anymore the binding constraint, and you've seen us take advantage of that
we've reduced some of the stack of preferreds on our book.
And then, as you think about the CET1 ratio, we'd like to get that down. I mean there is very little reason that we
should run above 12%. There is little reason we should run above 11%. And so, there is at least 1.5 points, if not
more, we're working through what's appropriate, right, because we've gotten a lot of data over the last couple
quarters that we want to factor in. But there's solid $1.5 billion of capital there that needs to go back to
shareholders over and above what would go back to shareholders just from the earnings that we create each
quarter, right?
And so, we obviously want to see the result. I think as the Fed and market participants do of the new CCAR tests.
We went through all the assumptions, as I think you guys did, too, and we think we'll show well.
We're very comfortable with our SCB. And I think what we'll do is kind of market-dependent and also based on
any Fed guidance for the industry, we'd like to restart capital return and, if we can, do that in the first quarter. The
pace of that – it needs to be a little bit paced. Got to be careful in this environment. And we're careful bankers
after all. But our view is that we need to start and then we need to accelerate that pace of return, so that we return
more than what we earn each quarter, and start putting that back into our shareholders' hands.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Yes. Great, great color. Thanks. And just a follow-up on – an expense question. You've been talking for a
good while now that you think that the company should be able to take expenses down annually. And I know we'll
hear more about this when you get to your formal outlook for the year. You did a good very good job this year, still
being at about down 2%. With the NII still being a headwind but fees looking better, how do you start to just think
about that calibration? And where are you in terms of just the ability to continue to net down the expense base?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Ken. And I appreciate you're letting us answer that now. And then, as you say, in January, we'll give our
annual guidance. I think, I've been clear. I think we've all been clear here from the management team that down in
15


State Street Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
expenses is the right direction of travel. And the direction and the volatility we've seen in market interest rates, just
reaffirm that down is the new up, and that, that's the kind of way we should operate in this environment.
And I think what you've seen is, us being able to do that now for effectively two years in a row, right. We did that
last year, if you adjust for the acquisition costs of CRD. We're doing that again this year. And I tell you we have a
lot of confidence in that momentum, partly because that frame of mind, I think, has really kind of organically
expanded through, not only our management team, but our one-downs and two-downs. So, we have got
hundreds of people, hundreds of senior folks working on productivity and expenses, all the while driving revenue
growth and fees and so forth, as you noted. But we're finding ways to do that across the line items, right. You saw
four out of five, our expense line item's down year-over-year, and many of them were down quarter-on-quarter as
well.
And I'd tell you, in our core operations area, we continue to find ways to automate and reduce manual touches.
And we think that has years of opportunity for us in technology. We're driving a transformation, and we've been
clear there. And I think more broadly, across our corporate functions, our businesses, the notion of productivity,
kind of more outcomes per person, is something we're actually adding measurement tools on, so that, we can, in
a more incisive way find the opportunities. And I think that's why you've seen, even with the pandemic, our comp
and benefit costs were down, 2% year-on-year, even more if you adjust for the currency swing. Our occupancy
costs are down. And every one of those is a result of those pretty broad-based and deep actions.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. So, I think it's fair to say, Betsy, that virtually every active manager is thinking about these, and there is a lot
of work underway at many asset management firms. There's basically five firms have come out and actually
launched them, and I'm not sure what the total is; most firms have launched multiple funds. But of the five firms
that have come out, we're servicing four of them. And I think that you'll find that many others, as I said, are looking
at this, and also many are looking at what's the experience of those that have gone first.
So, I think many firms view this as a potential new revenue opportunity. In that case, and to the extent it grows, it
will be opportunity for us. From a servicing innovation perspective, we've been on this now for a while. We're
familiar with all the different ways of doing it and, in effect, are servicing most of the ways, if not all of the ways, of
doing it. But I think it's too early to tell us whether or not this will be a game changer, but it's certainly something
that we felt like was important enough that we needed to put some innovation against it. We've got great market
share at this point, but on a market that's small and growing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just thinking about how you – the fee rate associated with it, is this something that's going to impact the
overall fee rates? Is it, like, lower than traditional fee rate type of products or not? I'm not sure how it's priced. And
then the other question is just how long does it take from announcement to the loading up into the plant? Is it, like,
a two, three quarter load; or it's just growing with the product itself which is nascent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. So, I mean, the fee rate is higher, but it's rate times volume. And I would say, so far, the volumes are either
growing but off of a very low base. So, I think it's just too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer
for us. But again our view was that it wasn't something we should ignore. Because we spent time on it right from
the beginning. We've actually worked on some of the rulemaking around it with the SEC. We felt like it was
something we should step into, and we'll just see where it develops. Not being evasive; we just don't know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Okay. Since the investment has made, it would be a relatively high margin as these wins come on to
your platform?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I mean, certainly, to the extent to which any of the existing funds grow, yes, high margin. We understand all
the different models, so what it takes for us to install them, I mean, we understand it now. So, it's not like a lot of
new incremental cost.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Just one clarification before I ask a question. The tax rate, Eric, that you
mentioned, that should be 17% to 19% for 2020 at the low end. Do I have those numbers right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
17% to 19% was the guidance, and we've reaffirmed that we're coming in at the low end of that range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. Yeah. I think I misheard the number. Okay, good. Good. And then, the first question is on CRD, the low
double-digit revenue guidance for 2020. I think it implies a little over $100 million for 4Q. Just wanted to make
sure that I'm thinking about that correctly. And then as we move into 2021, given the new wins that you're seeing,
and the momentum you're seeing on the Alpha platform, I guess maybe an early look of what you're thinking for
the core CRD in 2021 in terms of that growth rate potentially even accelerating from that low double-digit or the
around same or lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Brian. On CRD, I don't want to get ahead of myself for 2021. We're still doing the pipeline assessment
growth and so forth. I think what I'll tell you that we're quite pleased with the growth that we've seen here. We've
bought a business that had top line growth of 7% a year. Last year, we nudged that up to 8%. That was our first
year of ownership. And on this year, we're looking at low double-digits with some upside relative to where we
were a couple months back.
And you saw I think some impressive wins in the second quarter in the wealth space and some major renewals,
that kind of give you a sense for the kind of the effect of the State Street backing of software offering has on the
market, and our ability to convert that into some significant adds to revenue.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Now, we'll have to lap ourselves next year. So that's obviously going to be the hard part quarter-by-quarter-by-
quarter. And so, the we're doing all the things you'd expect us to do. We're expanding the sales force. We're
expanding the technical base. We're expanding the implementation engineers. But I think we're real pleased with
the trajectory, and just a double-digit revenue performance two years into an acquisition, I think, gives us the
confidence that not only did we buy the premier property in the space, but under our ownership it's very strong on
a top line basis.
And that's just CRD itself, right. CRD is really part of that front-to-back Alpha offering, and you've seen us expand
that with partnerships, win business in custody and accounting and middle office with Charles River. And so, I
think, that broader effect on our offering and our client discussions is shaping up nicely as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then – yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Brian, I want to underscore that last point that Eric just made, because we've been talking to you all right from
when we acquired Charles River – we closed it in October of 2018 – and we started talking about how the pipeline
was developing for not just what we – Charles River, but also for broader front-to-back kinds of offerings. You'll
note that in our new business wins this quarter, a third of those wins were Alpha related.
So, remember, that means that's it's not just a CRD win, but we're getting out that some form of the middle office
and the back office. And we've said that we were seeing it develop. We said that not only would we drive CRD
wins off of our existing custody platform, but we saw CRD and the Alpha platform as potentially driving back office
wins; and we're starting to see that.
I noted one of the Alpha wins was large European asset management that we had no existing relationship with
before. So, we'll go from zero to having CRD, the middle office, and fund services. So, that's how you – you
should think about CRD both in and of itself as a software provider, but also as part of this Alpha platform and our
pivot to being an enterprise outsourcer.

No, that's great color. And maybe just, Ron, while I have you, on some growth initiatives. ESG, obviously, you
guys are very strong [Technical Difficulty] (00:59:02) of ESG dedicated AUM. Maybe if you can talk about what
the plan might be to launch more products, that sustainably focused product, maybe especially on the ETF side.
Obviously, we've seen BlackRock really advance in the space. And then also on the servicing side, to what extent
within your data analytic offerings are you able to integrate ESG data and analytics services for your clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I mean, you've outlined it well in terms of how we think about it. Much of the visible ESG activity to-date has
been in SSGA, and in addition to all the stewardship work that they do, there has been much new product and
more new product on the drawing board.

analysis, et cetera. So, we've got a series of products that we're working on now that will help support that. So
stay tuned on this. It's something that's very important to us. We're even thinking about it in terms of how we put

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one. Eric, on the 150 clients that you mentioned
you're reviewing and working on, is there any difference with this group versus the prior 50 that could create a
different outcome?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
No, I think what's – the way we think about it, Mike, is that we rolled out a more sophisticated and engaged and,
kind of, action-oriented coverage structure on the top 50 starting at the end of 2018, and that's really took effect
this year. And that's about folks with kind of a sales orientation, with a deep relationship, kind of building
orientation, a sophistication to leverage the whole organization and bring it to bear to our clients. And what I'd tell
you is that actually has created at least several points of additional fee growth for that group over and above what
we're seeing for the rest of our client base, right.
And so, as we step back we're saying, wow, given that, that has created differential amounts of revenue growth –
and we track it, right; we track the top 50, we track the rest of the client base, and then we further subsegment
below. What we've decided to do is take the learnings – now, you don't take them kind of pound-for-pound,
because there's a cost to a coverage of organization, there is productivity and loading that you want to think about
the coverage organization with different size clients. But the client base, the next 150 clients are not dissimilar
from the largest; they just tend to be maybe in the one or two investment areas if they're servicing clients as
opposed to three, four, or five.
They may be $50 billion or $100 billion clients instead of a $1 trillion or a $2 trillion clients. But our clients in the
next 150 are large, they're scaled, they can take advantage of our custody, accounting, middle office, front office
services. And so, I think they're similar in a lot of ways, and that's why we think that in a more intense and
orchestrated coverage organization, which really then has the ability to unleash another several points of revenue
growth there, can then help lift the overall revenue growth of the franchise in a way that we've already seen for the
top 50.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, Eric, wanted to start with a question on the securities portfolio. The duration increased
sequentially. It now sits at about 2.9 years, and admittedly be a little bit of a surprising development just given the
accelerating prepayment activity. Some investors – and admittedly not all – but some are speculating we could
see some steepening in the curve in the event of a blue wave and various inflationary programs are launched.
And I know that outcome is not contemplated in the NII guide. I was hoping you could speak how you're
handicapping extension and AOCI risk. Maybe you could just frame the capital and duration sensitivity if we do
see 50 or 100 bps of steepening?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A

Yeah, Steve, it's Eric. Those are exactly the kind of the balancing drivers that we're quite careful of. To your point,
we model out all the outbreak scenarios; 50, 100, 150, 200 bps. And what you've seen us do is both the – I think
considering how much maturity and duration we've put on, we've historically run at this to 2.5- to 3-year range of
duration. So, I think we're within that band. We added a little more to offset some of the shortening that came on
the MBS prepayments. So, we did that consciously. But you also didn't see us take that up to a four or five-year
duration, and run long on 10-year and 30-year bonds. So, I think it's calibrated.
One of the tools we used here though is not only to think about where we play on the curve, right. This is really
the middle part of the curve. This is five- and six-year maturity paper on average with some a little longer, but
we're careful. But we also use the HTM accounting designation because a lot of what we hold we'd like to hold for
to maturity, and you've seen us put $40 billion, $45 billion of securities in held to maturity which insulates it from
the OCI pressure, and we do that very consciously.
And we also are purposeful in what we put in held to maturity because we think that's got to be pristine, it's
government paper, it's government guaranteed paper. And so, that's how we balance the up-rate scenarios is
through a mix of kind of just carefulness on duration and then the HTM accounting.
And I think, in a lot of ways, that lets us feel comfortable that we always need a volatility buffer in capital, but we
don't want to have one that's enormously large, because then we couldn't return capital to shareholders. And
that's way earlier in some of my remarks, I described that there's a solid amount of capital to give back, we need
to keep some for the OCI volatility, but we think we can manage that to reasonable levels given, given the
portfolio design and some of the accounting designation.

Great. Thanks for the color, Eric. And maybe just as my follow-up, just want to ask on the Investment
Management strategy. Now, the segment did see a nice lift in pre-tax margin this quarter, but the profitability has
consistently lagged some of the traditional asset management peers. And just with the latest wave of
consolidation, how you're thinking about skill adequacy of the platform, especially on the active side? And just
given more subdued profitability as well as the significant capital cushion, Eric, that you cited, just how might you
look to reposition the segment to compete more effectively? And I guess, more specifically, how does inorganic
growth fit into that strategy?

Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. So it's Ron. I mean, these are exactly the questions that are very much on our mind and that we're working
through quite actively. We like the franchise. It's got some terrific assets to it, particularly the ETF franchise. And
we're seeing more and more that that's an area where the big are getting bigger, and it's just hard if you're not in a
top three or four position there.
But it also has its challenges, right? It's a fairly narrow platform, from a product perspective. So it operates really
at the active beta end, quant beta end, and is relatively small in things like alternatives. So we're thinking about it
from a product perspective, both organic and inorganic, and then obviously from a distribution perspective. The
only distribution we have is our institutional distribution. So we'll probably talk more about this at some of the
upcoming conferences as we finish through our work, but it's something that we're actively considering and
evaluating.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, good morning. Can you talk about the value of, kind of, deposits to State Street? I guess, I'm thinking about it
from the angle of, with deposits up a lot, 20%-some year-over-year, NIM is low as I can ever having remember
seen it, and you're holding a bunch of capital events, the balance sheet's just kind of swollen with these deposits.
At some point in time, does it become economically advantageous to kind of turn deposits away, say, through
pricing and de-lever the balance sheet and return more capital to shareholders, assuming the Fed lets you buy
stuff back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Jeff, it's Eric. Those are all the right questions that I think we as bankers have to navigate through. I think what's
changed and is particularly important for us as a bank is that the binding constraint for us has actually shifted.
Two, three, four years ago, it was around leverage and probably around Tier 1 leverage, probably around
supplementary leverage ratios, right, which have an expanded kind of view of the balance sheet.
And those rules though were effectively adjusted over the last year, I think, in such a way that they became more
rational and didn't put us in this position where we needed to any longer push away client deposits, which is
something we did do. I remember, in 2017, that was one of the actions that we took, and it wasn't very pleasing to
us, nor to our clients. But we're no longer in that position.
What's really changed now is that it's the Common Equity Tier 1, the risk-weighted asset ratios that really matter,
both the spot ratios, then under CCAR and the SCB. And because of that shift, we're effectively in this position
where we're open for business on deposits. And while in a way it's a larger balance sheet, it's 20% larger, that's
not constraining for us.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
And what that does put us in a position to do is to carefully expand the investment portfolio, you've seen us do
that this year; continue to lend more to our clients, and you've seen us do that as well. And so, that's the path
we're taking, which I think actually supports the financial system in the right way as we lend and expand the
investment portfolio. It supports our clients. And to be honest, that will come back as earnings and returns to our
shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Jeff, what I'd add to that is, many of these deposits, to the extent to which we push them away, we create
operational complexity for our clients because most of these deposits that we get are associated with our custody
activities. So when you start to separate those, you're creating some operational complexity. And Eric noted that
we did some of this mostly in Europe back in 2016, 2017, and it would be hard for us to get those deposits back if
we did that too.
So if you believe that these are going to be useless forever, it might be something that you'd be willing to do. But
given the lack of constraint, given the fact that it creates operational complexity for our clients and to retain that
optionality if and when in fact you do see a steepening of the curve or even increase in rates. We like our
approach right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. The current approach drives 85 basis point of spread income effectively on those deposits, because many
of those are actually priced at zero or 1 basis point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Not as much as we'd like, but to be honest, that's remunerating to the income line and to our shareholders. And,
over time, will be some normalization of rates, we could see that expand again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And just a quick kind of bigger picture follow-up. It's probably too soon to tell, but have you seen or do you
expect to see any impact kind of versus the pre-COVID environment in servicing as far as kind of the trend of
industry consolidation or maybe even pricing pressure? Do you see things changing with the whole work at home
and just everything we're kind of facing now versus a year ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
I think the trend that's most visible to us, at this point, is that investment managers, even asset owners, sovereign
wealth funds, plan sponsors, are really taking a hard look at their operating model. They were before. If anything,
this has put more spotlight on those operating models. I mean, we had instances where we had clients – okay,
the example I'm thinking of was an asset owner had roughly 1,700 employees and had the ability to have 70 of
23

them working from home, from a technology perspective. So there's broad-based look at operating models, which
we think will be beneficial to us.
Ultimately, as long as you believe that investment markets are going to continue to function and grow, what we do
will still be there. What we're positioning ourselves strategically for is that as these operating models need to be
overhauled, we want to be the enterprise outsourcer that is doing it for them, taking on as much as we can of the
front, middle and back office.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Eric, Ron. A couple of questions for you, folks. Firstly, can you give an update on – you had a good run with
CRD in terms of the revenue growth, as you mentioned. Can you give an update on where you stand on the
synergies that you've achieved and accretion dilution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Vivek, we continue to run well along those lines. I think we had said that accretion would turn positive by
the end of the second year. We effectively – we've gotten to that point given that the synergies have come in both
on the revenue and the expense side. I think the expense synergies came in actually a little faster than expected.
I think we've always historically been good at expenses as a company.
And revenue synergies have come in quite nicely. They've moved around a little bit. We had some synergies from
some of our sponsored repo activity sold into the CRD base, which came in a little lighter because of the
compression in rates. But some of the fee activity that we have and the sales activity that came from the State
Street franchise have come in stronger. You saw the very significant wealth win and some of the other activity. So
I think we're really pleased with where we are and have hit our milestones.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

Okay. Thanks. And then a different one, Eric, for you. The reverse repo business, it's been shrinking. You've
shrunk quite a bit the last couple of quarters as spreads have diminished. Do you see it shrinking further or is it
stabilizing? What are you seeing in spreads? Any color on that?

Yeah. The sponsored repo business is something that we've done. It started small. It got to $50 billion, $75 billion,
$100 billion of assets. It got north of that. Sometimes it's spiky. We had months where we were at $150 billion.
We're back now in the kind of $80 billion to $90 billion range. And the biggest driver has been the changes in front
end rates, right? The repo rates and kind of one month T-bills tend to create movements in positions of asset
managers who are very focused on overnight out through one month paper. And because T-bills were suddenly
more attractive during really the spring and part of the early summer, we saw that sponsored repo balances come
back down.
We've now seen some, I think, normalization in those rates. I think they're back to being 5, 10 basis points apart.
We think that gives us some opportunity. And we've seen a bit of growth here over the last month or two, and I
think we're – notwithstanding the flood of cash from the central banks – see some amount of upside there, and
that's what we're working towards. That comes through our NII line and that could be – that is factored into some
of our forecast, but that's the kind of area that we're pushing on.

purchases that you've done.

Vivek Juneja Q

Sorry, yes, investment portfolio. I shifted gears on you right away. Sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
I'm okay with the off-balance-sheet client sponsor program questions or the on-balance-sheet investment portfolio
questions. They're both good ones. On the investment portfolio itself, what we've done is we have continued to do
a couple of things. I think, first, we have generally expanded our MBS portfolio. So, we're up $9 billion in securities
end of period this quarter. I'd say $5 billion, $6 billion in that would be in MBS space.
But we have rotated the types of mortgage-backed securities. You'll see eventually in the regulatory filings that we
expanded a little more in CMOs, in commercial MBS, all government guaranteed; because part of what we're
doing is trying to put on some cleaner duration paper as opposed to take up premium at risk. And we've also
continued to hunt in the specified pools and just the current coupon.
So, that's been some of the rotations there. And then we've supplemented that with a little bit of expansion in the
international areas around some foreign sovereigns and then some of the AAA agencies have also been an area
of expansion.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I guess one easy question, one tougher question. But, first, so end of period loans were up, is that right? I
mean, why is that? What seems to be a little different?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, end of period loans were up – well, they were up slightly. We like lending to be up in this environment given
that we're there for our clients. You had two offsetting factors. You had, number one, the continued growth in our
client lending. Capital call financing in particular continues to be a real important part of our growth to the alts
managers and that was just offset by some amount of reduction in the overdraft balances on an end of period
basis, but the net was up slightly. And I think more indicative is total loans were up about 9% or 10% year-over-
year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And have you said anything about cutting cost in 2021? How should we think about cost next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
I guess, you continue to ask the easy questions. So, we've not given outright guidance for next year, Mike, yet.
We'll do that in January. But we've been clear that we reduced cost this year, 2%. Last year, adjusted for the
acquisition, we were down 2%. And we continue to like the approach given the economic environment to drive
cost down, and we think that's appropriate. So those are in our plans and what we're working through is what's
the magnitude of that next year, because what we do need to do is continue drive for gross cost savings, but we
also need to reinvest in our business. And especially as we add new business, and you saw some of the wins this
year, we're going to have to implement that; some of that takes some funding. And then we want to continue to
invest and expand into products, features, and so forth of the platform, and that front-to-back platform in
particular, which is going to take some resources. But net-net we expect cost to continue to be down not only this
year but also next year.

...what I would like to add to that is, we've been very clear that this is not a one and done kind of thing. I mean,
sure, there are some tactical things that we – that if they're there and low hanging fruit, you grab at it and you
realize that. But we've been – we're on a sustained program to transform our business. Much of it is around
productivity improvement and much of that is driven by the ongoing automating of processes, reduction of manual
processes, et cetera. So, this is – I mean, you should expect us to be thinking about this and implementing this on
an ongoing basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, and that's a good segue to my harder question, which is maybe a big phrase like a Jeopardy question. So,
the answer I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, what you're doing is, you're improving efficiency, productivity,
automation; you're expanding your revenue streams as you said at the start, Ron; and now you're expanding the
total addressable market with more focus not just on the top 50 but next 150. And I guess the question is, why?
And is part of the why because assets under custody were up 11% year-over-year and the servicing fees were
only up 2%? In other words, I don't see the revenues keeping up with the business volume and, therefore, you
have to go to these alternative streams. And, I guess, really the question is, what are you seeing one pricing
pressure? You said it was easing, you said some business has been coming on at a higher margin, but we're not
seeing it in the final results that are released to us. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, let me start here. I would add a fourth element to what we're doing which is also basically expanding our
addressable market; meaning that moving from the typical traditional custodian role of being a fund servicer to
also being an enterprise outsourcer, and to work with the actual management companies or the plan sponsors on
their own operating model, and that's an incremental revenue stream that isn't available to us.
Why are we doing it? I mean, it's no secret that the traditional fund services business has its series of challenges,
not just price compression, although notwithstanding that we've done a good job at it. I mean, just think about it;
go back 10, 15 years ago, it's all about new funds being created. Somebody will have a line of domestic funds,
then they might move into other asset classes, they might move into new jurisdictions, new countries. Now, if
anything, you're seeing the number of funds go down as distribution platforms are saying, one, we don't want as
many funds; and, two, we're more interested in SMAs anyway. So it's these trends that are underlying our
strategic pivot here.
Now, as we've also said, it takes a while for this revenue to be realized, and you're kind of seeing that even in the
way we started talking to you about this expanded pipeline at the beginning of 2019; now, we're talking to you
about front-to-back Alpha wins. And so, you should expect to see that some of the things that we talked about in
the past, in 2019 and early 2020, will start to be showing up in future quarters as Alpha wins. It just – these things
take longer, because, going back to what I said earlier, we're actually working with the management company on
overhauling the way they work, the way they invest, the way they employ data, the actual tools that they're going
to be using, the actual tools they're not going to be using. So, I hope – that's the why, in terms of what we're doing
here.

question, because we really want to see what happens with this next round of kind of intermediate CCAR test,
and just see if there's anything different or not there. So we're keeping an eye on it. We like the fact that we've
already called a couple of preps. We'd certainly be happy to do more, if we can. So I think that one is certainly
always in mind and we'll give that some more thought.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
I think on the broader topic of capital ratios, we're doing a lot of work here and maybe just to frame out. Clearly,
we have too much capital given the limitations, and that's fine; we'll get it back to shareholders as soon as we
can. The ratios that we need to do is we clearly need to run above the 8%, the SCB requirement, let's assume
and we feel confident that that will stay and that 8% SCB; obviously subject to the Fed indications.
But the work we're doing is how much CET1 capital volatility have for OCI, and that's where we're kind of working
through. Well, how can we, should we put in to held to maturity versus available for sale. So, we have some ability
to influence that. And then we have some amount of volatility to be honest in RWAs, right, in risk-weighted
denominator just because you get volatility, you get some – a little bit of RWA expansion in the FX books.
So, is that – do you need volatility cushion of at least 100, 200 basis points? Probably. We, as bankers, want to
run conservatively. So I think what we're wrestling through is where in the range of 11% is too high I've said, 10%
is kind of one of those kind of areas that you want to think really seriously about crossing below, because there is
some volatility in our business. And so somewhere in that 10%, 11% range. There's got to be somewhere that
we'd like to run and we're doing a little work to fine-tune that.
But I think if you do the math that away, you'd get to a view that there's really a substantial amount of capital to
release based on where we're running, because we're running at 12.5%. And 12.5% down to somewhere in the
10% to 11% range is a real return, a sizable return, for our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Absolutely. That would be very positive. Moving a little bit back into that investment securities portfolio. Clearly,
we're all focused on the rate environment and I think everybody is on one-side of the boat, so to speak, in that the
rate environment is going to stay low for an extended period of time. But it also brings out the interest rate risk for
a securities portfolio should rates go up surprisingly for 2021 and 2022.
What indicators do you guys keep an eye on? And you can name two or three that really would make you change
the way you look at your investment security duration, or where there could be a risk from a mark-to-market
situation if this got out of line and rates started to go up, which nobody is really planning for; the forward curve
certainly doesn't call for that at the long end. So, I'm just curious how do you guys manage and keep an eye on
this so that you don't get caught off-side should something change unexpectedly 6 to 12 months from now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, I think there are a number of indicators, but part of what we do is we manage for the concerning
outcomes, the downsides, right. So, what we're careful in the portfolio is, you don't want to barb out between 1-
month paper and 30-year paper because you get a bit move in rates. The 30-year hurts, same thing with 3-month
paper and 10-year paper. So, we're quite careful about where we operate on the curve. And it's not just an
average duration that we run at, but we have a series of limits across the curve and we'll position, to your point, to
be quite careful and circumspect. So, that's one; there's kind of an outright management process in sort of places
that we'll operate.
I think in terms of indications, there's clearly a set of Fed indications and then market indications. The Fed has
been quite clear about their policy around lifting rates. They've been quite clear about how long. They've been
quite clear about inflation targets and kind of general monetary policy planning, and I think that's actually – you've
got a scribe a fair amount of reliability to that.

And then, there are all the market indicators, whether it's the front end of the curve, the steepening, the volatility
inherent in some of the curve structures and other indicator that we're very conscious of. And, then I've got to say,
there's no substitute for doing a – running a battery of tests, a battery of stress tests, because you're always
worried about what you don't know and what you're not seeing in the marketplaces; and the good thing about
rates markets is we've got 50-years-plus of solid history and we'll do all those tests and then we'll do the
theoretical ones. So, anyway, it's something we're very careful on, I think, is the bottom line.

Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Yeah, mine is just a real quick question, a clarification question. So, Eric, when you were talking
about the NII of kind of the go-forward, pass the fourth quarter, I think you said a couple percentage points down
first quarter, second quarter. But did you mean a couple of percentage points down in the first quarter, and then
another couple of percentage points down in the second quarter, and then stabilize from there? Thanks.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Good question, Brian. I said a couple percentage points down either in first quarter or second quarter. We think
there's a small step-down from 4Q to one or the other. It's just really hard because you're always working through
what are the headwinds and tailwinds at an inflection point to call the trough. But we think it's sometime in the first
half, and we think it's – we think – given what we know today and kind of the market indicators and the
assumptions we've shared, we think it's one of those two quarters.
