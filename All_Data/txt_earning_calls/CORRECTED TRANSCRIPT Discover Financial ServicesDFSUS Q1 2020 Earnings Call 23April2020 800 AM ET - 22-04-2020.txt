Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines
have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig A. Streem
Vice President-Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Sure. Thanks a lot, Maria. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our call. We'll begin on slide 2 of our
earnings presentation, which you can find, as always, in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion this morning contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements
that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation.
Our call this morning will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and from John Greene, our Chief
Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time, as Maria said, for a question-
and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we appreciate it if you limit yourself initially to one question. If you
have a follow-up, maybe queue back in, so we can be sure to accommodate as many participants as possible.
And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I hope all of you and your families are staying
healthy and safe during these very challenging times. I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the
healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store workers and many others who've been working so hard and,
often, great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country.
The structure of this call will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. After my opening remarks, John
will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve build. I'll then come back and provide
additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter.
Here at Discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. Our headquarters functions
moved to work-from-home on March 16 with minimal disruption. And our technology team and field leadership did
an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 Discover call center team members working from the safety of their
homes within two weeks.
Our robust business continuity plans, digital business model and 100% US-based customer service helped
ensure our representatives were ready, even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from
concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Early on in the crisis, we answered 95% of calls in less than five minutes. And for April, as our team got more
comfortable working from home, average hold times have been under one minute. We are providing significant
support to our customers across every product to help them through this crisis.
We've expanded payment plans across our credit card, student and personal loan, and home equity products,
and waived fees on CD early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds. Our strong
capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. John will provide additional detail, but
I'm especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products.
Some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results, specifically in sales volume
and card loan growth. For the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25 per share, as the
benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense. As we adopted the
CECL reserve methodology on January 1, the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as
an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment.
Actions we have taken since the crisis began include significant tightening of underwriting for new card and
personal loan accounts with additional employment verification. And we've pulled back on balance transfer offers
and line increases. As I've mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months, we have been tightening credit at the
margin as we have felt for some time that we are in late credit cycle. But given the present environment, we are
adopting a significantly more cautious view.
To give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our
contingent liability, meaning the total open-to-buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly 5.7 times
loans to around 2.7 times, and the percentage of the portfolio below a FICO score of 660 has gone from 26% at
that time, down to 19% at the end of 2019. So while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the
economy, our portfolio is significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis.
In addition to our credit actions, we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with
the economic environment. We are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions over the
remaining three quarters of 2020, and we'll continue to review expense levels as the economic environment
evolves.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail, then I'll come back to discuss the
current environment.

John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to echo Roger's thanks to all the people
working on the front lines of the pandemic. I also want to thank all of our Discover associates. They have pivoted
to a work from home environment, while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout.
Today, I will summarize the results for the quarter then provide details on our credit performance and loan
provisions. I'll conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to Roger to
summarize our COVID-19 response actions.
In light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance. But as Roger
mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year with the majority in

the second half. Our expense actions include, reducing account acquisition expense, cutting spending on brand
awareness and consideration activities, and reducing vendor and technology spend. We will continue to review all
discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed.
In the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of pandemic and our responses, we are not
going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes and revenue. So you can [indiscernible]
(00:07:47) additional disclosures on slide 11 to 16 in the appendix of this presentation. And as always, we are
happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.
On slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement. Revenue, net of interest expenses, increased 5%
this quarter driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our Payment
Services segment, principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment.
Net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. This was down 25 basis points year-over-year, due largely to
lower loan yields as the prime rate came down in response to Fed rate cuts in September and October of last
year. This was partially offset by lower funding costs. The additional Fed rate cuts in March of this year will impact
net interest margin beginning in the second quarter.
Provisions for credit losses include a net charge-off of $769 million, up 8% from last year, and an increase in
reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook. I'll have some additional
comments on credit in a moment. But before we turn to the next slide, I want to discuss operating expenses. They
were up 13% from the prior year first quarter. The increase was principally due to higher compensation expense,
increased marketing costs and investments in technology.
Turning now to slide 5, showing our key credit metrics. Credit performance remained stable in the first quarter.
We did not see any discernible impacts from the national COVID-19 containment activities or from our own credit
mitigation actions in response. Card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last year's quarter, due principally
to seasoning of loan growth.
The credit card 30+ day delinquency rate was up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter,
with both metrics reflecting consistent performance in typical seasonal patterns. Our private student loan and
personal loan portfolios also had stable credit performance in the quarter, with both showing slight improvements
in charge-offs and delinquency rates.
On slide 6, you'll see our allowance for credit losses. We added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses in
January of this year as we transitioned to a life of loan CECL basis. At the end of the quarter, we added
approximately $1 billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. The reserve
build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9% recovering through 2022, and a decline in GDP of nearly
18%.
We also included our best estimate of the reserve implications of the government stimulus programs. As the
economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear, we will
adjust our allowance accordingly.
Turning to slide 7, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a
decrease in loan balances, partially offset by capital returns. For purpose of calculating regulatory capital, we
have elected to defer recognition of the CECL day one adjustment for two years. So we will begin to phase in our
day one CECL impacts in 2022 with 100% phased in by 2025. The federal banking regulators have also provided

a phase in for the day two impacts of CECL, with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until
2022, and then treated the same as the day one deferral.
Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 99% over the last 12 months. As Roger noted, we have
suspended our share buyback program, but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividend.
Our liquidity position remains very strong. As of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets, $6
billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations, and $35 billion in
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of April 20, our liquid assets have grown to more
than $23 billion.
In addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-to-
consumer deposit channel, with average deposits, increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up over 55%
of total funding. Based on the strength of consumer demand, yesterday, we reduced rates on our savings
accounts by 10 basis points and will continue to look for opportunities to do so.
In summary, good progress on the expense front, liquidity is robust, capital remains strong, and we continue to
monitor and manage our credit exposure.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Roger.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, John. While we will not be providing new guidance, given the uncertain economic outlook, I do want to
provide you with an update on two key areas where the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way
that was not captured in the Q1 results.
On slide 8, we're giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how COVID-19 has affected
cardholder spending in April, as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales.
The first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019. So, you can see where our
cardholder spend is normally distributed by industry. We then give you the year-over-year growth percentages for
the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date April.
On a day-adjusted basis, everyday sales, which includes gas, groceries, and wholesale clubs, and makes up
about 22% of total sales, saw growth of 10% during the quarter. So, far in April, however, everyday sales are
down 14% year-over-year as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in
petroleum.
Discretionary spend is down 33%, driven by the travel category, which, although only 8% of cardholder spending,
is down 99%; and by retail, which is down, 11%. As long as stay-at-home orders remain in place and many
businesses remain closed, we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon
the pace of the recovery.
Turning to slide 9, I want to take you through the Skip-a-Payment programs we have implemented to help our
customers during this period of economic difficulty. We recognize that COVID-19 has placed financial stress on
the Discover customers who may be out of work or have suffered reduced wages. One of the key differences in
this downturn compared to the Great Recession of 2008-2010 has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also

the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief
period of unemployment.
Therefore, we are offering support to those impacted by COVID-19 with Skip-a-Payment programs available
across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for a natural disaster. Through the
first half of April, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in receivables in Skip-a-
Payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products.
The receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans, but we are encouraged that the number of daily
enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late March. We will continue to work with these
customers closely and potentially extend programs, when required, to meet the customers' needs.
Let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide
an industry-leading customer experience across all of our products. We have taken swift and meaningful action to
adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment, continuing to lend but with tightened standards for new
accounts and for growing existing accounts.
We are implementing expense reduction initiatives, while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our
business over the long term, and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves. While our
capital position is strong, we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital
base.
Clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but I'm confident that we have taken the correct actions.
None of us can foresee when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the US economy to begin to recover,
but Discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. We have a loyal customer
base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver long-term value
to our customers and shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bob Napoli of William Blair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you and good morning, everybody. Hope everybody's well. A question on the – your outlook for
unemployment and GDP, since you're reserving for the life of the loans, and I know you gave some numbers, can
you just go over those numbers for 2020, 2021 and what you're expecting as far as recovery? And what effect will
that have on loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Thanks, Bob. This is John. I'll take a shot at that. So there's a wide degree of economic forecast that we
took a look at while we're building our models, and ultimately, our allowances. So what we built in was
unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year. So, about 7% through
the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through 2022. So not expecting a real quick recovery and rather
slow, and our allowances has reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out.
And your second part of your question on loan growth, so loan growth will be dependent on how we see the
economy and the recovery proceeding. As Roger mentioned in his comments, we have been cautious coming into
this cycle. And when the pandemic hit, we pulled back further. So loan growth will be subject to, essentially, the
recovery of the economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
But we would expect to see loans declining, I guess, from here, at least for the next quarter or two, I mean, is that
fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Bob, there are a lot of factors that'll go into where loans go. Certainly, the retail spend numbers that I gave you will
have a significant impact on that. The credit action and expense actions we've taken will have an impact on loan
growth as well. But to John's point, there's a lot of uncertainty that'll be determined by the pace of the recovery.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Thanks. Good morning. And I hope you guys are doing well as well. I guess it's been pretty well documented that
since the end of March, some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse. So could you just talk
about how that might be contemplated in the future, or whether or not you guys think it should be? And then also,
how you guys are incorporating some of these Skip-a-Payment to cure rates and such inside your loss
assumptions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Thank you. So, as I said in my response to the last question, there's a wide degree of variation on the
estimate. So when we put this together, we were looking at what a likely scenario was. Now, the economic
backdrop continues to evolve. So we certainly did consider that. There are some overlays related to how we think
about recoveries. And certainly, we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs.
But it is uncertain. And if the economy deteriorates further and we don't see a recovery, that will have reserve
implications. If it runs out as we've modeled, that will also play through into the balance sheet and the P&L. So I
know I'm not being real specific on your answer, but at this point, given the uncertainty, this was our best
estimate.
In terms of your second part of your question on Skip-a-Pay, so that – though the nature of that program is – for
card is that an inbound call will happen, the customer, if they're impacted by COVID, they'll get an automatic,
basically, payment deferral. They won't have to make the payment. If they call back a second time, they can get a
second deferral on the payment. And after that, they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll
into delinquency buckets and ultimately, charge-off.
So as we provisioned, we thought about life-of-loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of
capturing the dynamics on the portfolio. The one impact on Skip-a-Pay is that if a customer is in trouble and isn't
able to pay, it will result in up to a two-month deferral in the charge-off, just by the nature of how things roll. But I
do want to point out that just over 80% of those customers who entered into the Skip-a-Pay program were current
at that time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And just to clarify, I guess, the same forecasts you used for your assumptions in the first quarter, have
those actually been revised for the worse early into the second quarter? And if everything remained the same,
would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision, or are you saying that it's really subjective
based on sort of how you're seeing things unfold based on your own forecasts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So there's a number of factor, and I'm not trying to be elusive here, Sanjay, but unemployment and GDP
contraction are obviously key inputs. The duration of the slowdown will also be important. Geographic input
impacts are important. Job classes are important. So ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery. But
just to go back and clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels at a peak and then a
very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming in through 2022.

And Sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated at point in time and so we'll go through a similar
process next quarter. My guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecasts between now and
then. And I would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions, that is done on a near
continuous basis and at a much more granular level. And so we're looking by industry sector. We're looking by
geographic area. We're making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how much employment verification
we do. So I contrast the reserve calculation with how we're managing credit, which is near continuous.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
It sounds like your macro assumptions were not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as kind of where
unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery, yet the card reserve reflects cumulative losses that are
probably less than half of what you experienced in 2008/2009 timeframe. Could you just talk about how – the
portfolio has changed in a manner that it makes you comfortable that losses won't approach what we saw in the
last recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
There's a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed. So Roger mentioned this in his
comments in terms of the open-to-buy. So the open-to-buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the last
recession to this recession. Average FICO scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 and 600 basis
points, which is a material change.
Our underwriting, frankly, is far more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago. And frankly, the actions that this
business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers was
drastic and very, very quick. So I don't know if there's a perfect corollary between the last recession and this
recession, time will tell. But certainly, I feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action. And
again, if the economic outlook changes, we'll adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Yes, John. Trying to sort of tie you to a specific number on the stimulus. Is it realistic that you could have, as
you've looked at your scenarios, maybe a point or two lower net charge-offs from stimulus? And then secondarily,
most financial institutions have said there'd probably be another reserve build – a sizable reserve build in Q2. Just
wanted to – I know you've talked a lot about it, but is that the case as you sit here today in April?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
So, real difficult to answer at this point. So we're going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and, actually,
how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters.
In terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we modeled was relatively modest. So I don't know
if I would go to a full percentage point on charge offs, but there was a mild impact. And as we see that unfold, it
will become more clear. The key thing on the stimulus programs, at least, initially, was with the unemployment
checks going out in the $600, I'll say, benefit, that's a front-loaded impact, and we'll have to see how things
develop on the back half of the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Thank you. Good morning. Roger and John, I was hoping to follow up on your thoughts about the potential benefit
from government relief programs, specifically on the Paycheck Protection Program. Can you comment on the idea
that unemployed consumers who are receiving payments under PPP and therefore, are not receiving
unemployment insurance, may be understating the true level of initial claims, which you guys have always cited
as an important leading indicator of credit performance?
And then if we extend that line of thinking, how much of a concern is there that, like those receiving
unemployment insurance, employees participating in PPP based on certainty about their employment outlook and
still have to make decisions about which bills to pay first, what that means for the unsecured credit card?
But just I guess, the overall consensus view seems to be that PPP is a positive in the near term, but it's not a
longer term fix. And I was just hoping that you could maybe speak a little bit more to, I guess, the broad potential
that the PPP program will benefit, your loss experience and your confidence level on that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I mean, I think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit, but given the depths of the decrease in
economic activity, what we all really need is for the economy to start back up again and that will depend on the
pace of reopenings in different states, and is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here.
Some of the traditional relationships may break down a bit. A lot of the initial unemployment claims have been
driven by, I would say, entry-level employees in retail, restaurant and other industries that may have less of a
correlation with what we see in our prime card base. So, there isn't necessarily even the same one-to-one

interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different. And that job mix may
change over time during this recession as well.
So I would summarize with the government programs are helpful, but what we really need is the economy to get
going again, and so a lot of this will depend on the pace of the recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Thanks. That's helpful. I guess maybe if I could just follow up with a conceptual question on CECL. I guess, a
different way of asking what's come up on the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate relative
to your expectations at the end of Q1, at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that we will see additional reserve
building, and then, therefore, when conditions stop deteriorating, we'll stop seeing additional reserve building?
And maybe kind of another way to ask that is if you can envision a scenario where you would need to continue to
build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve. Just trying to kind of get – just get the big
picture idea of how CECL is going to work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. So big picture, if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate, there will be two dynamics that are likely
to happen. One would be the CECL life of loan provisions would increase, so the allowance would increase. We
would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio is stable and that the lending activity we were
doing made sense.
So you could expect that the portfolio, frankly, might not increase and would actually decrease. And if that were
the case, you would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall
loan size. So there's multiple dynamics there that come into play, but I hope that's conceptually helpful.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs – sorry,
firstly, this is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to ask about the forbearance programs and the Skip-a-Pay. Are you
also continuing some of your typical modification programs here?
And can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you
lower credit limits, available to borrow, et cetera, for those who seek either of these programs, and just how you
expect that to lead to – like with the Skip-a-Pay, whether you – will people be transitioning from that if they
continue to grow through the delinquency buckets to your other modification programs? Or is it that once you do
the Skip-a-Pay now, you aren't eligible for some of those other programs? Just want to understand a little bit more
on how you're dealing with some of the delinquencies. Thank you.

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. It's Roger. Let me try at a high level. As John described, for card, it's a two-month program, up to two
months for Skip-a-Pay. But they do one month, less than 5% have renewed for the second month. So we'll see
how that plays out over time.
We do still have our program for customers that need a longer period of assistance. Regulators have been
encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers. But again, I think it really does
depend on the pace of recovery. As John pointed out, over 80% of those taking advantage of Skip-a-Pay are
current. And so our hope would be – and again, that's why we've modeled it after some of the disaster relief
programs we've traditionally had, that they will require a shorter bridge, and then will be able to get back to paying
their bills. If not, we have longer term programs to assist them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And just – sorry, just to clarify on that one. Do you do anything with the longer – with the Skip-a-Pay, there's no
change to their credit limits, available to borrows, et cetera, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
No. For those who have signed up for Skip-a-Pay, it does not impact their credit limits.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Thank you for all of the information on the Skip-a-Pay. I'm
curious what you're seeing in terms of payment behaviors for consumers who aren't on Skip-a-Pay programs. Are
you seeing an increase in consumers who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So we're still [indiscernible] (00:37:54) clear pattern to emerge, and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in
sales volume that you've seen. What I would say is that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors
and revolvers. And so it's balanced in that way. But what happens with payment rate, I think, will be determined
on how quickly those sales ramp up, some people making larger payments. And you can see from the inflow into
our deposit products, there are a lot of households who are still okay, but are looking to fortify their positions. So
I'd say it's too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment rate.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Got it. Okay. And look, we share your view in looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of how the
challenges emerge, but one thing that historically has been, subsequent to a natural disaster, are significant
insurance payments into those regions, which create things like huge cash inflows. We've seen deposit spikes
associated with that. I don't necessarily think that we're going to see that this time. Is it your view that that will
actually change the post-event payment behavior and credit characteristics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
There's a lot of speculation out there. In some ways, this is like a natural disaster. In other ways, there's a big
debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after a disaster, you won't
quite have that here. And so is the economic – people aren't going to go to twice as many restaurants. And so is
that economic activity just lost?
I would say probably, while you don't have the degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented
amount of governmental assistance. And my guess is you'll continue to see additional programs. So that is
probably a bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance.

Kevin J. Barker Q

Thanks. Just in regards to the liability side of the balance sheet, I mean, are you seeing changes in behavior on
your deposit side? And what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall deposit
growth? Given the different – the stimulus checks combined with stress across unemployment, I know it's difficult
to really pinpoint it, but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where you might actually see a little bit of
pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline. Could you just give us a little idea on your expectations there?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Yeah. So I think supply and demand are starting to come into balance, but it's going to take another quarter or so.
The appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. We've traditionally been second or third
on the bank rate table. We have been – recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on
the overall demand for our products. So I think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe
place to put their cash. I think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels, and decided that
we're a good spot and they've chosen us.
So as we look forward in future – I'll say, future quarters, it'll be subject to a couple of things. So the supply and
the demand factors, what our competitors are doing and then, obviously, our own performance. But we look to
kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pull back some of the NIM that was impacted by the Fed actions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then in regards to some of the [ph] stimulus (00:42:30) programs that you laid out with the $400 million
expense savings, should we assume that that's off of what your previous guidance was, or is that separate from
what you [indiscernible] (00:42:39)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
No. Thank you. Yeah, that was off the previous guidance. And as we said, when we issued that, it was – it'd be
based on a strict payback analysis, so are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental investment. With
the economic backdrop changing, we, of course, made the appropriate decisions.

John Hecht Q

Morning, guys, and thanks very much for taking my question. Your first question is, where are we on utilization
rates and average balances? And how do that compare to maybe a period like entering the last recession?

Utilization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Utilization rates. So as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, I think, we showed that the amount of
contingent liability, i.e., the ratio of – which is kind of the opposite of utilization, is significantly down from prior

years. So, one, as part of the credit tightening that we've done over the last several years, a key component has
been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then I'm trying to quantify the effects of the rate changes in March. How much of the
impact to benchmark rates did you see in the quarter? I know it was later in the quarter. And what do we think
about NIM trends over the next quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. So we didn't see any impact in the quarter from the Fed reductions at the end of March. So there was about
150 basis points of reduction. So, we're not giving guidance, but I'm going to give you a couple points in terms of
how to think about it.
So the 150 basis points hit, so there's an impact for three quarters of the year on that. Our deposit betas have
traditionally been about 50%. We took some proactive steps early in the year, reducing overall deposit rates by 20
to 50 basis points depending on the product. And then we're pulling back on the promo mix, which should also
help rate.
So you put those factors together and I think it draws a picture of how NIM could look for the year. Now the
quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what's happening in the particular quarter on revolver
and transactor mix.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Roger, maybe as you kind of sit and think, and obviously, you're going to be doing less marketing,
but you're going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products. And as you think about Discover's product set
and service niche, kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where there are
opportunities to capitalize? And maybe if you could also, just throw in thoughts on rewards competition in this
environment as well. Thanks.

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Moshe, for the question. One of the things we're trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in
this environment. And so even as we've made cuts, we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen
Discover, build the brand and make sure we're in great shape for the future. So we're excited about the
partnership with Quibi that just launched, products such as our Miles card, where you have the ability to redeem
at Amazon and PayPal. That's a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Our third quarter promotion is for restaurants for the 5% program. We think that will resonate very, very well. And
our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios. So for example, issuers that
have big sign up bonuses, they're having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail
sales and complaints from their customers, where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending.
So we're very excited about where our products are positioned. We've talked a lot about the traction we're getting
in deposits. I also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment. Who wants to waste money
on a credit card with an annual fee? And we're the only one with only no annual fee products. So we're really
excited about some of the opportunities we're seeing in this environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. I would assume that you would expect better – whether it's a response rate or conversion rates and things
like that in this – while marketing is lower, you might have some of that, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. We're seeing – and some of it plays out in the personal loan space, for example, some of the traditional
competitors in the fintechs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. So even
with reduced marketing, we're still hoping to generate good results.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning and thanks for all the comments. Couple of questions. Just one earlier, I think you mentioned
something about how this recession is going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick
job losses and then expected recoveries. Do you know the job types by customer that you have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
We get it at the time of underwriting. So some of it can drift over time. It varies a bit by product. We have much
better information for the personal loan customers, as an example. We don't have for our student loan customers.
They haven't been employed, so it does vary. But I would say we have very strong for personal loans and a good
amount on the card portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then separately on the reserving, as you know, folks like us, we're looking at the reserve levels relative
to the 2018 bank-run stress test, just to get a sense as to how you're comping this upcoming recession versus
that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago. And when we look at that, the credit card reserve that

you've taken is running, if my math is right, around 45-ish percent of that stress loss period, but the other
consumer is running much higher. On other consumer products, I think it averages around high 80s, low 90s.
So I was just wondering, is there a reason why you feel this tough kind of recession is going to be tougher on that
other consumer and does it have to do with your answer you just gave, or is there anything else there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I would probably say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different
stresses. A lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. So just comparing scenarios based on peak loss
can give you different numbers. So I wouldn't say it's anything different we're seeing by asset class, it's more
technical based on those scenarios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just two other quick ones. When people sign up for Skip-a-Pay, and let's say they go for the one
month. Is it automatic that they can go for the two months or they have to call in every time or check it on the e-
mail?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes, Betsy, they have to call in on the card side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. And I guess with the call times being extremely low, that's not going to be a challenge for them.
And then lastly, on the forbearance side, or the call-ins that you've been receiving. From the slide deck, obviously,
it showed that the beginning of April was the peak. And I got a few questions in overnight. Why do you think that's
the case that the requests for Skip-a-Pay have already started to decelerate at a time when unemployment claims
are still rising here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. That's a good question. Some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs. And then it could
be just the cycle. We do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pickup as they approach into the second
month for certain customers. But we'll have to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I guess, I would probably point to, A, people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even
before they're actually unemployed. And so they may have called us knowing that their boss said, hey, we've got
one week left, and then we're closing down. So there isn't necessarily that line of sight. The second thing, my
personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process, as opposed to each
week, 6 million people are losing their jobs. And so that's why we would have seen the bubble earlier because we
didn't have that same capacity constraint that I believe you've seen around unemployment claims.

Hey, good morning, guys. One quick question, I guess, on the Skip-a-Pay payment. Can you guys give further
demographics, I guess, on what you're seeing in these customers? I mean, is it safe to assume that the lower
FICO score customers are the ones currently enrolling in these Skip-a-Pay payments or is that too much of a
generalization?

Roger C. Hochschild A
