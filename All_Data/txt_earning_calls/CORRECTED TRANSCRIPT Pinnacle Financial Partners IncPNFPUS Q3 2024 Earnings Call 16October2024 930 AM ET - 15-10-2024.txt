M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Matthew. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I expect most of you know that we begin
every earnings call with this shareholder value dashboard, GAAP measures first, but quickly go to the non-GAAP
measures, because personally I find that the non-GAAP measures provide a clearer picture of the job we're doing
for shareholders. You can see third quarter was a fabulous quarter. Balance sheet volumes all grew nicely, with
loans up 6% linked-quarter annualized, earning assets up 12% linked-quarter annualized, and core deposits up
9% annualized.
Asset quality remains very strong, and because they've historically been the most highly correlated with long-term
total shareholder returns, the three most important metrics for me are revenue growth, EPS growth, and tangible
book value accretion, all up nicely again this quarter. Let me point out the persistent growth in those three critical
measures and the double-digit five-year CAGRs for the three most highly correlated metrics with total shareholder
return.
Obviously, I'm proud of the long-term consistent trajectory of those three measures, but I know that even after 24
years of sustained, outsized growth, there are always some that remain fearful that somehow we won't be able to
propel the culture as we grow, that the law of large numbers is going to overtake us, that somehow those results
are primarily dependent upon me or on my partner, Rob McCabe, or some key man that won't always be here, as
opposed to a simple, consistent, repeatable model.
Third quarter was another great quarter of outsized growth for our firm. But before we review those results in
detail, we'll take a minute and make sure everybody understands exactly how that growth comes about and why
we've been able to consistently deliver it over time. Obviously, the fact that we serve major markets in the
Southeast is huge. Census Bureau numbers paint a vivid picture of the tailwind that exists for banks in the
Southeast. It will be very hard for banks in shrinking northeast, west and mid-west markets to match our growth,
but more important than the size and growth dynamics is the competitive landscape.
Here, we're plotting the share gains and losses for us and the other market share leaders in Tennessee's four
urban markets over the last decade. We're blessed to do business in markets where we consistently take share
from vulnerable competitors who've dominated the market heretofore. We entered the North Carolina, South
Carolina and Virginia markets in 2017 with our acquisition of BNC. We specifically targeted the Carolina and
Virginia markets, to some extent because of the size and growth dynamics, but more importantly, because we
wanted to compete against those same vulnerable competitors with whom we have successfully competed in
Tennessee.
So you can see here that share is concentrated among those same vulnerable banks. And there for the most part,
they've established a track record of consistently giving it up, which is why the competitive landscape is the most
important contributor to our ongoing growth, even more than such impressive size and growth dynamics.
Here's what the share client look like in our first market, Nashville, Tennessee, according to the FDIC deposit
share statistics. Now, firm-wide assets are over $50 billion. And you can see that we have a lead share position in
Nashville with roughly 50% more share than our next closest competitor, an astounding position. As most of you

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
know, we're a commercially focused bank. So this is the commercial market share data according to Greenwich
for businesses with sales from $1 million to $500 million in Nashville.
There in the middle, you can see that we have a 30% lead bank share, more than 4x our next closest competitor.
We've been executing the same playbook across the state of Tennessee, first with the de novo start in Knoxville
back in 2007, followed by acquisitions in Chattanooga and Memphis, both in 2015. You can see the remarkably
similar growth in all three markets. In 2015, following our acquisition in Memphis, we were number 13 on the FDIC
chart. In the most recently released FDIC data, we climbed to number three. In Chattanooga, where we were in
the fourth position in terms of FDIC share following our acquisition in 2015, today we're number two, rapidly
closing on number one. And in Knoxville, from a de novo start of 2007, we're now number four on the FDIC chart,
a similar position to where we were at the same tenure in Nashville. And like Nashville, we're number one in terms
of the commercial market share as measured by Greenwich.
As I mentioned a minute ago, we acquired BNC in 2017. Here you can see the dramatic transition we made in the
Carolinas and Virginia, with a 10% loan CAGR and a 14% deposit CAGR since the acquisition. Importantly, on
the right, you can see the growth in commercial deposits when we apply Pinnacle's simple, consistent and
repeatable model.
Just like the urban markets of Tennessee, we're executing the same playbook across the Carolinas and Virginia.
And in 2019, we began a number of de novo market extensions in the large Southeastern markets like Atlanta,
DC and Jacksonville, Florida, all with similar growth dynamics and a competitive landscape to that in Nashville.
I've already demonstrated the trajectory that we had in Nashville over our 24-year history there, where we are still
taking share, by the way. You can see the largest markets on the left that the deposit growth is even more rapid
than it was in the startup period in Nashville, and even some of the smaller markets on the right using a simple,
consistent, repeatable model, it appears we're replicating our startup pace in Nashville there as well.
So, yes, we have the added benefit of operating some of the best markets in the US. Frankly, it's even more
important that the share leaders in those strong Southeastern markets are vulnerable, offering us a once in a
generation opportunity. But the hedgehog strategy here is to attract and retain the best bankers in the market,
leveraging our award-winning work environment, using our differentiated recruitment model. We create a laser-
like focus on revenue and EPS growth for every single non-commissioned associate in our firm using our win
together, lose together incentive plan. And then for roughly 24 years, virtually every year we've targeted top
quartile revenue and EPS growth in order for management and associates to earn their incentive at target.
Think about that, an ability to continually attract the best bankers in the market and allowing nearly all roughly
3,500 associates to produce top quartile revenue and EPS growth with one simple annual cash incentive plan. It
is simple, consistent and repeatable, not luck or happenstance. This nice and recognized culture continues to
propel itself with Pinnacle just listed last quarter as Fortune's Third Best Place to Work in America among finance
and insurance firm. And it's pervasive in most markets we are perennially the best place to work, with Memphis
and Nashville repeating again just last quarter.
As investors, I know most bankers will try to convince you that their people are the best, that their people are their
most valuable asset. So I'm not going to try to convince you that. I'm going to let our clients do that. On the left,
this is our business clients and our eight-state footprint [indiscernible] (00:10:07) relationship managers and how
they relate to those vulnerable banks with the larger share in these Southeastern markets. We literally have
amassed the best talent in Southeast from a business client's perspective according to Greenwich. And as you
would expect, highly valued relationship managers produce better financial outcomes over the long-term.

On the right, you can see how our associates compare to our primary Southeastern competitors in terms of PPNR
per associate, a critical test of effectiveness. Attracting the best talent has enabled us to build a national
reputation for an unmatched client experience, both among consumers and businesses, both in terms of people
and systems which resulted in peer-leading long-term value creation. It's about our ability to consistently and
repeatedly grow earnings. You can see on the top-right, TSR leadership, it's not a new phenomenon and it's true
across 5, 10, 15, and 20 year time frames. And if you look at the EPS growth across the bottom of that chart, our
earnings growth has substantially outpaced peers for a decade, and nobody is close.
And so, to put a bow on all that, in this one chart, you see our unusual ability to consistently attract and retain
market best talent and their ability over time to consolidate their clients and associated loan and deposit volumes.
We validated this model any number of times over the years, averages are dangerous, so nobody is average,
everyone's above or below average, but on average it takes relationship managers about five years to consolidate
their books.
It generally comes in on a roughly straight line basis, and when consolidated, it's roughly the self-funded book in
the $65 million range on both sides of the balance sheet. You can see on the left that we currently have a total of
235 (sic) [234] (00:11:58) relationship managers that are at various stages of consolidation, and within that five-
year consolidation start-up period. And on the right, you see the extraordinary loan and deposit volumes that we
believe we'll land on our balance sheet just in 2025 and 2026 if these cohorts of relationship managers continue
the consolidation of their books over the next two years at the average pace.
And I've already told you, it's our expectation that we'll layer in another large cohort next year and the year after
that and so on, producing an incrementally laddered volumes, it's a simple, consistent, repeatable model. And so,
as Harold walk you through our third quarter results, hopefully you'll able to see these factors that underlie not
only our historical success, but our third quarter success and our ongoing success for that matter, that our culture
continues to strengthen as we grow, not diminish, and that this persistent growth model is not dependent upon me
or other key leaders, it's not dependent on the change of administrations, it's not even meaningfully dependent on
a more vibrant economy, although a vibrant economy with strong loan demand would very likely enhance our
growth. Our remarkably persistent growth, even in difficult times, is the result of this very simple, consistent and
repeatable model.
So, Harold will walk us through the quarter in greater detail.

Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone. We will start with loans which increased by $539 million during the
quarter, or 6.4% linked quarter annualized. When we consider just CNI and owner occupied commercial real
estate, our loan growth in these two critical segments was approximately $706 million, or 17% linked quarter
annualized.
We're modifying our growth expectations for 2024 to now reflect a range of 7% to 8% growth. We were obviously
pleased with loan growth this year. It's been an uncertain environment all year long and there is quite a bit of
uncertainty currently, but with the election coming up and what appears to be the initiation of a down rate cycle,
both of these matters tend to point to somewhat less uncertainty in the near future, which hopefully creates
calmness and brings out the users back to the borrowing type.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
As to our end of period rates, particularly SOFR-based loans, end of period rates are beginning to reflect the Fed
decrease by quarter end. More on loan and deposit betas in just a second.
One of the keys to our financial plan all year long has been increasing pricing on the renewal of fixed rate loans.
As the top right slide indicates, we're expecting about $1 billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan portfolio
during the fourth quarter of this year, with an average yield of around 5.1%. We believe yield lift of nearly 200
basis points is reasonable as these cash flows come to us during the fourth quarter.
Our competitive advantage is that approximately 22% of our revenue producers have been with us less than two
years. All of them are ready continue to move market share, which bodes well for us as we begin our planning
processes for 2025. We will continue to lean on our new lenders as we enter for the fourth quarter and head into
2025.
Deposit growth has been a real bright spot for us all year. Excluding brokered, we increased deposits by $887
million in the third quarter. We're also pleased with non-interest bearing deposits and their performance in the
third quarter. Again, signaling that we are finally beginning to see volume growth for DDA accounts. Even our third
quarter deposit growth, we are maintaining our deposit volume forecast with somewhat more specificity around a
7% to 9% growth estimate.
We continue to move deposits into the index deposit product area. Almost 50% of our deposits are now indexed
to Fed funds as we prepare for a down rate environment this should be helpful. As we have said before, we
continue to like our competitive position as to deposit rates and believe it gives us more flexibility to our current
rate [indiscernible] (00:15:56) materialize, which includes two additional 25 basis point rate cuts in the fourth
quarter.
We've included an information on betas thus far for loans and deposits. We are very pleased with how loan and
deposit pricing has performed over the last few weeks as our relationship managers have been diligent in making
sure that we're able to reprice our deposits as quickly as we can to offset the impact of a lower rate environment
on our earning assets. So far, our deposit beta has outperformed our loan beta and we remain optimistic that we
can continue to mitigate the impact of rate cuts by the Fed to both our net interest margin and more importantly,
our net interest income as we move through the next several quarters.
As expected, with the investment securities restructuring late last quarter, we did anticipate NIM expansion and
are pleased with the 3.22% we posted this quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that we believe our NIM
will be flattish as we consider the incremental rate cuts. We are modifying our outlook for net interest income
growth for 2024, just under 8% growth for 2024. We know everyone is thinking about 2025, net interest income as
we are, the yield curve will have a significant influence on how all of that plays out next year. So we are running a
lot of rate scenarios currently.
We believe all banks perform better with the traditional yield curve and I believe all of us are optimistic that the
rest of the existing inverted curve continuing are in fact decreasing. A traditional curve, commercial clients coming
back with increased energy to borrow again and national elections in the rearview mirror, we believe, all point to a
better operating environment for growth [indiscernible] (00:17:39).
We're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. We mentioned one $9 million charge-off of CNI accretive in
the press release last night. We performed an in-depth review of that credit during the quarter, electing to charge
off a portion of the credit in place to remain on non-accrual. Resolution we hope will occur next year as the
company seeks a permanent take out part. As to our outlook for charge offs, we're narrowing our guidance to a
6


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
range of 21 to 23 basis points for 2024. We are also narrowing [indiscernible] (00:18:12) provisioning in relation to
average loans to a range of 32 to 35 basis points.
No real change in how we feel about credit as we head into the fourth quarter or 2025 for that matter. Our charge
for past dues classified loans and potential problem loans indicate we're performing near historic lows, which
should be a meaningful indicator as to when we believe credit is coming. We have no reason to believe this won't
continue to perform well as we head into the fourth quarter as well as into 2025.
More about commercial real estate and again in the supplementals there's more information on commercial real
estate, primarily from a multifamily, industrial and office. As we noted in the press release, we have now
successfully dropped the lower part of 70% for construction loans to total risk based capital at September 30,
which was sooner than we thought last quarter. Our appetite has changed modestly now that we're below the
70% threshold.
That said, and let me stress, any new commitments to this space continue to prioritize strategic client
relationships only, and that we will proceed cautiously. We anticipate that our construction concentration will fall
further over the next several quarters into the 50% range and we don't expect to see any incremental lift in the
concentration until mid-to-late 2025. Beyond all that, we are currently tracking to achieve our 25% target for total
non-owner occupied commercial real estate multifamily construction in mid 2025.
Candidly, we have always admired our commercial real estate book. The last couple of years have been a
rollercoaster of negative media attention around CRE and the impact on regional banks. I know many of you know
this for Pinnacle, our house limits are very modest. We pride ourselves on granular book, our largest ticket sizes
for our bank or conservative in comparison to what we hear from other franchises. Thus far for Pinnacle, our
commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very well and we expect that to continue.
Now, [indiscernible] (00:20:18) and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding the loss on the sale
of securities in the second quarter, fee revenues were up 8.3% to 23% in 2Q. Our wealth management units have
had a strong year and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue into the fourth
quarter and into 2025. The fees associated with deposits are also doing quite well, with commercial analysis
leading the way. As to run rates in comparison to the second quarter, during 3Q we realized an increase of about
$1.5 million from the sale of fixed assets and approximately $3 million in increased fair value adjustments from
several of our other equity investments.
As to our outlook for 2024, we are again raising guidance for our fee revenues, excluding BHG from 14% to 17%
to a range of 23% to 26% growth over last year, which seems reasonable given the performance of several of our
primary business lines this year.
Expenses came in slightly more than where we thought they would be as of the end of the second quarter.
Importantly, we are increasing our incentive target to a 90% target payout for fiscal year 2024. Again, we're
raising our target with [indiscernible] (00:21:30) to our belief 2024 will be better than we thought as of the end of
the last quarter. As you know, direct linkage between our financial performance and our incentive plans are
correlated and thus we can't raise one without believing the other will move up as well.
Additionally, our hiring was really strong in third quarter with 37 new revenue producers compared to 89 for the
first six months of the year. Going into the fourth quarter, our recruiting pipeline remains strong across the
franchise. Lending related expenses are up quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to a $2.1 million new recurring
charge related to the loss protection fee from the credit default swap we executed in the second quarter.

As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently estimate our total [indiscernible] (00:22:16) expense level for 4Q
should approximate the third quarter level.
Now to BHG and we will be quick. As the slide indicates, originations picked up again in the third quarter with
originations approaching $1 billion. As for the fourth quarter, BHG production should be somewhat consistent with
the third quarter. As to placements, total placements were less than originations, which was consistent with the
second quarter. BHG continues to build inventory in order to fill larger orders in the fourth quarter and as we enter
2025. Also there remains great demand for BHG paper, both from our office platform and the institutional buyers.
More than 600 unique bank borrowers acquired loans over the trailing 12 months, and the number of banks
eligible to purchase loans from BHG continues to grow.
As the spreads auction platform spreads increased to 9.2% in the third quarter. Balance sheet spreads have
remained fairly consistent with the prior quarter. All in BHG believe spreads are holding in what has been a higher
rate environment. BHG believes, as rates decrease now the good news for them both a volume and a rate
perspective.
Off balance sheet substitution losses amounted to 4.2% in the third quarter, up from 3.4% in the second. As a
result, BHG increased reserves for off balance sheet losses to 6.2%. The good news is that past dues are
trending in the right direction, which hopefully is a sign of a better credit experience in the not so distant future.
On balance sheet losses were up modestly to 7.4% in 3Q from 2Q. Again, even though the percentage of all
balance sheet losses increased in the third quarter, the actual dollar amount for all balance sheet losses
decreased. A similar [indiscernible] (00:24:03) has occurred in the prior two quarters as balances fell faster than
national losses, which is why the percentage loss was higher. Our BHG fees amounted to approximately $16.4
million in the third quarter and we expect the fourth quarter to approximate that amount.
Our concluding thoughts on BHG this time around are that the management is focused on building the
sustainable franchise and as such, pushing as much product through the pipe is not as important as maintaining
and building an even stronger balance sheet. We believe BHG remains one of the most profitable and dynamic
fintech models in the country, and with an even stronger balance sheet, BHG should be an even stronger
competitor in the future.
Now to our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Again, we've raised our expectations in some cases and lowered
our expectations in others. In the end, we feel more confident about our 2024 outlook given our strong
performance in the third quarter. All of this should be a good sign for 2025. We've started our annual planning
effort for next year. Our financial goals will be the same, top quartile revenue and top quartile earnings. The
investments we've made in our new markets and our [indiscernible] (00:25:17) success are the building blocks we
will lean into as we build our 2025 plan.
As I mentioned earlier, if we can get beyond an inverted yield curve and our owner-manager clients getting more
confidence and start borrowing again for growth, I'm confident 2025 will be another strong year for Pinnacle.
We've been through a lot of information, so I don't want to spend a whole lot of time wrapping up as we move in
the Q&A. We are very fortunate that we operate in what we believe the best banking markets in the United States
and in markets where we believe our large competitors are vulnerable and given up market share as they shy
away from relationship based banking and the impact that has on delivering differentiated level of service.

We have also over the years become an employer of choice. Our recruiting efforts have helped tremendously out
of success of our brand in all of our markets. No longer do our market leaders have to spend hours introducing
our brand to our prospective associates. As brand awareness has already found its way into our markets in and
outside of the world. Our best place to work and work environment results resonate among not only our
associates but also potential recruits and that translates to a very successful client experience and ultimately to
our shareholders.
In the end, we are focused on earnings growth, revenue growth and tangible book value growth. Top quartile
performance is the goal year in and year out. We believe if we consistently hit these financial goals as well as our
strategic goals, our shareholders will be rewarded.
And Matt, with that, we will open up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. Everyone, the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question is coming from Brett Rabatin from Hovde Group. Your line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Wanted to start with Slide 23 and just talking about the flattish margin expectations for
4Q. Given the beta performance that you've seen so far with loans and deposits and the fixed rate loans repricing
in 4Q, I'm a little surprised margin expectations aren't a little better for, at least the fourth quarter. Can we just
walk through again kind of your expectations for the fourth quarter betas, loans and deposits and maybe how you
see some of those SOFR tied loans performing in 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, sure. I'll try to get at it this way. As to the margin itself, we think that will be fair, will be flattish. I think as we
get deeper into rate cuts, we'll have better opportunities for some balance sheet hedges to take to come into play.
But that won't occur until we get like past 100 basis points. So we're still got some heavy lifting to do with our
client base over the next call it 50 basis points, 75 basis points on rate cuts, if that make sense.
So we'll have to still work on depositors pretty hard here over the next few months just to get to a point to where
some of these balance sheet hedges kick in and we get some kind of a call it a mini cavalry shows up. As to net
interest income, we still expect to see some growth next quarter. And so we don't expect that to be flattish, but we
do expect the NIM to kind of be flattish for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful, Harold. And then just thinking about, one of the pushbacks I tend to get is like, hey, you guys
have obviously done a great job moving a lot of deposits to being indexed, but the loan portfolio is fairly variable
with over 60% repricing fairly quickly. Do you guys think the margin – I know you got a lot of things to think about
and it's maybe not fair to ask until we know what the yield curve looks like, in a quarter or two, but just thinking
about timing maybe versus liability sensitive versus asset sensitive, is it fair that the margin to be lower in a
9

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
quarter or two from here? Or do you think you can outrun maybe some of the loan repricing as betas matriculate
through that SOFR portfolio in particular?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, we do believe we've got the opportunity to kind of keep the margin where it is. There's obviously going to be
some risk that the margin does go down, but it won't be a lot. It might be a basis point or two. But again, what
we're going to have to do is rely on our relationship managers to continue to communicate with their clients, to be
able to reduce these lower – into these lower rate categories. And that's what we're going to do by pushing a lot of
deposits into the 50% index, that's obviously a tailwind for that. So I guess I'll stop there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then if I could sneak in one last one just around DDA, you know, impressive in your prior-year growth
versus average. Any seasonality in the DDA this quarter and just, maybe any comments around your efforts to
grow that bucket, which, the whole industry is focused on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we think there is seasonality. We don't think that's all the story for the third quarter and we don't think it'll be
all the story for the fourth quarter. In order to attract those deposit accounts, non-interest bearing, you got to get
the entire client relationship. And we've been successful in a lot of our new markets in attracting that and pulling
that critical product across the street. And so that's where we think we're going to get some lift as we move
forward in not only Atlanta, but also DC and Jacksonville.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Brett, if I might just add, if you look at Greenwich data, I would say, our lead bank penetration is extraordinarily
high versus all our competitors, which is a way to say that the class – business class view us to be their lead
bank, which means we got their operating accounts. And so again we're adding clients at a pretty dramatic pace,
taking share. So from 30,000 [indiscernible] (00:31:35) that's the biggest thing that we're doing relative to growing
the DDA to market share.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Let me clarify the question; you're asking, do we have an appetite for M&A?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. I mean, we spent some time on the deck going through the success you've had there and then
the next slide taking organic share from there is that part of the strategy going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think what I would say is it's unlikely, I never say never, but I think it is very unlikely that we'll be acquiring
banks. And I think you've heard me say before, the reason for that is our ability to hire so many people, our ability
to do these market extensions and grow so rapidly with a significantly lower risk profile than doing that vision,
because I don't think it's likely we will make acquisitions. Russell, I think one other point I'd hope to make is, okay,
we entered some of these markets by way of acquisition, but the organic growth that we put on it, the pace of that
organic growth was substantially beyond what those companies were doing when we acquired them.
So it really does drive to illustrate the power of this simple model of hiring the best bankers in the market, having
them consolidate their books of business from where they were to here is a really reliable growth mechanism. So
because of that, I don't think you ought to have much expectation we'll be acquiring banks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Appreciate your thoughts there, guys. And then just one more for me, switching gears, if I
could, to BHG appreciate the thoughts on the 4Q trend, but as we think about the comment that lower rates
should be better from a volume and rate perspective and past dues trending in the right direction, is it reasonable
to think that revenue could grow in 2025, or are there big picture things you could share in terms of the revenue
trajectory going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Russell, I'll try to work my way on the question. We really don't want to give out too much 2025 numbers,
but we've had conversations with BHG as to their expectations for next year. I would imagine that is probably
going to be a mid-single to high single digit kind of number when we finally get to it. But we've got more work to do
there and we've got some – we've got a lot of kind of work to do around what their expense base will look like and
so forth for next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q

Hi, this is [ph] John Rowe (00:35:10) on for Jared.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, [ph] John (00:35:13).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
I guess just sticking to BHG for a second, the reserve for on balance sheet losses has been coming down, I guess
the last few quarters, but the liability for substitution and prepayments look like that's still trending up. I guess.
Why wouldn't these be moving in the same direction? And I guess is there any color on where that liability for
substitution and prepayment could be at a good level here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
[ph] John (00:35:45), I'll give you a couple of things to think about. One is a substitution – the loans that are better,
that have been sold out to the community bank network, are the responsibility of the community bank. So BHG,
there is some lag in how those losses come down versus the loans they have on their own balance sheets.
Secondly, those loans are likely have longer tenure. So the losses related to the own balance sheet loans are
newer and they typically see most of the loss content within the first 30 months. So this tail that's going on with the
off balance sheet has to do with some of these losses of loans that have been around for quite a while as well as
the community banks, so making them back nearly as time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. So I guess maybe we can think of the on balance sheet credit trends as
somewhat of a leading indicator of the off balance sheet credit trends?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we believe so. We believe initially the off balance sheet will replicate with the on balance. Now the reserves
associated with them are calculated in two different ways. One is a CECL-based reserve and the other is the
trailing loss content with emphasis on the trailing 12.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Okay, great. That's really good color. And then I guess just one other one for me. Moving over to the hiring, it
sounds like 2025 is going to be a pretty big year for bringing on new hires. As you kind of deepen your presence
in the some of the expansion markets, can we still expect the new hires to ramp up in terms of bringing on loans
and deposits at the same pace as the – some of the initial hires? Or was there sort of a diminishing return that we
should expect as you kind of add to the total number of RMs in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, my belief is that the assumptions that we used in that illustration are good assumptions on a go-forward
basis. And the reason I say that is you might guess we've tested this model a lot of different times and it almost
always comes back to numbers that resemble what we're showing you there in terms of you can see the build up
from when people have been here one year, when they've been here two, when they've been here three, when
they've been here four and so forth. And those are the current – those – that 234 associates or relationship
managers, those are the 234 today at whatever late stage of consolidation they're in. And so, yeah, we believe
that for them to move forward at the average run rate is a good assumption. Am I answering what you asked?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah, that was exactly it. Thank you so much. Okay.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning. Just a clarifying question around the move in index deposits. I know, Harold, you touched on
this a little bit last quarter as well, but how exactly are you're getting those customers to move from negotiated to
index? And do you think that this creates any sort of pressure on potential outflows as rates presumably move
lower in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, it's – I think what we're doing – we're doing it with individual clients, taking them out of the negotiated rate
bucket into the index rate bucket. I don't think there's any increased risk for clients to leave us based on rate that
we will lower the rates and that did not change, but in any way. So I think what we've got to do is lean into this
relationship that our folks have with these clients. And I think we've got great confidence when they not, not
seeing a lot of outflows there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steven, one of the things that you remember, some of the conversations that we had back when it seemed
apparent we were headed into a down rate cycle, I think we gave indications that we had already begun prepping
both our services, particularly our associates and also our clients, for how we would respond in the down rate
environment. And so, inside the company, there is great understanding by our relationship managers, which is,
you know, the whole key to both how we get business and how we keep businesses that's the relationship they
have with those clients.

So, as Harold said, those are one off negotiations. We're not sneaking up on somebody, any of those kinds of
things. So it would not seem to me that there is much risk of attrition.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Fantastic. That's helpful. And Terry, I mean, you guys added in a lot of great slides in the deck this quarter. And
clearly, like you showed across 10 and nothing changed across 15, nothing changed, the growth profile is still
what it is. But as you continue to look more and more like one of the large regional banks that you've kind of taken
a lot of the personnel from through the years, how do you continue to outperform them so significantly or how do
keep yourself from starting to look like a large regional bank?
Is it really just the incentives and the culture, or is there anything in particular that keeps you from, I don't know,
centralizing in the ways that they have that becomes an impediment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think – that's a great question. So first of all, I think start with the culture. Everybody's said you've been
around, what, a long time. Even before you showed up, people we're saying, Terry, you can't [indiscernible]
(00:42:04) culture, as you get big. But the truth is, if you – we do an internal work environment survey here, we
have 93% of our associates fill it out. If you're not familiar with those estimates, I don't think you're going to find
anybody that would have that kind of engagement with their associates so that they would give you the feedback.
And beyond that, the answers that they give are in always above 70% in the top bars rating, in other words, as
they rate their level of agreement. Those numbers have been consistent over a long time. They're not getting
worse.
Any of those kinds of things that specifically we're moving up the chart on things like best place to work among
millennial, best place to work among women, and as I said in the presentation, they're best place to work among
financial services, third best behind American Express and Synchrony. Those things are getting better, not worse.
And so I just – I don't mean to go and on about it, but I just want to say that the culture, there's no doubt that I and
others have an important influence over you could screw it up if you wanted to, but it does more or less propel
itself, once it has the power, once it's rooted in, so forth, it propels itself.
So, I think the culture will continue to help us. I think our geographic focus will continue to help us. I've got peers
that are smaller than me, that have gone to a lot of business organizations and so forth. I get it. That's how all the
big companies do it. And so if your goal is I want to be a big company, then you do that. That's not really our goal.
What we're trying to be the best, we're trying to offer a distinctive client experience, and that's the motivation to
keep it geographic. It will get bigger, in my opinion, because we got all these market expansion opportunities and
we can take share from these people and so forth. But my belief is that we ought to continue to take share.
One of the things I was trying to get across, because so many people, Steve, and your question there are
skeptical. I mean, low, large numbers don't get those guys. They can't keep growing that thing at that pace. You
know we do keep growing at that pace and it's just a really simple thing. We're able to attract bankers from other
banks who leave those banks and come over here and bring their clients with them. Man, I wish I had some really
sophisticated thing that we've thought up, some high-tech fintech, cool thing, we ain't got it.
What we do is we just have a great place to work that people want to leave other big companies to come here
and bring their clients. And so you can see we're hiring people at a dramatic pace that's not slowing down, is
picking up speed. And so, again, not to ramble on too much, but just my whole communication is at least as I see

it, I don't think the low or large numbers going get us. I'm not saying it won't get you, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years
down the road. I don't know about that. But as far as I can see, it doesn't look like the low, large numbers are
going to get us. It doesn't look like culture is going to disappear all those kinds of things.

Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning. How are you doing Ben?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Doing well. Appreciate it. Also really appreciate Slide 21. I know you touched on it quite a bit. I think it's really just
illustrative of kind of the DNA you guys have. Like when you look at it, roughly one-sixth of the bank isn't there yet.
Like you have the people but you don't have the loans. So it's kind of just shows that like even if you stopped
hiring, you should still ramp up pretty materially. It kind of leads into my next question is when you think about like
most banks manage both sides of balance sheets left and right, with rates, where you guys you have so much
growth potential, I think it's much more of the come in the calculus is what are you putting on rates and deposits
that's come on – so more so kind of curious of the people you've hired. I'm sure it's more C&I oriented, but when
you think about the clients that they're bringing over, is there a general mix of deposits or what we should kind of
expect for relationships coming over between loans and deposits?
I'm sure they're obviously franchise additive, but that's a huge part of the margin outlook going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Ben that's a great question. I think we do emphasize C&I and private bankers. I think we have a general
belief that commercial real estate lenders, we've got those with well-heeled there with our capacity there. So we
are interested in private bankers and C&I lenders. And I think they bring just a general mix depending on what
market they're in, if you're in a market like Huntsville or Bowling Green or Louisville, so on and so forth, then
you're going to have a broader client base than, say, if you're a C&I lender in Atlanta or Jacksonville or DC, say.
So, I think it just all depends, but the calculus that we use is pretty much consistent that we're looking for that
person to bring a significant amount of their book from their former employer over to our bank and to do that
15

within a reasonable time period. So, we keep up with that. We try to make sure if somebody needs help, we give
them the help to do that. Otherwise we're saying, go get them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Ben, I might just add to that. I think, as I've said in my comments, averages are always dangerous, because
nobody is average, everybody is above or below. But, on average, it's a pretty self-funded book. It's about $65
million on both sides of the balance sheet over a five-year period of time that these relationship managers bring,
and Harold brought there, that includes some private bankers, it includes some commercial bankers and large
business bankers, small business bankers and so forth. But that's sort of how the average works. It is a self-
funded book. And there's – you do have to provide energy and emphasis around deposits. To your point, the
biggest riddle for a company like ours is always how do you fund the balance sheet when you can produce assets
at the pace we can? But if you take a look at something like DC, which is a really large high-growth market that
we're building 90 miles an hour, that thing is more than 2:1 self-funded. And so, anyway, I'm just rambling to say,
generally people are consolidating their whole relationship and that includes both sides of the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. No, that's helpful. Also, kind of just dovetailing off of that, like, with the additional hires, I know you gave
guidance, but this flywheel isn't stopping, if anything, it's speeding up, is it fair to kind of assume double-digit hires
equals double digits expense growth next year? Or is there any sort of initiatives behind the scene or synergies
that – there are obviously some synergies just like scale, but anything kind of lever-pulling on you guys' side of the
table where you could kind of mitigate some of the expense growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
We can always do things to slow down the hiring. I don't think we'll do that. The biggest impact that we will have
to our expense growth next year will be where we end up in the incentive pool this year and how much more it will
take us to get back to target next year, because we will load the expense target for next year – the expense
growth number at target. And that will be the biggest influencer of how much growth we'll have next year or at
least in the first part of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Ben, if I could say this, and obviously somebody is going to take this comment the wrong way, but I'll just say this,
we generally take great pride in, if you look at our non-interest expense growth over a decade, over two decades,
over the last five years, whatever, it's a double-digit expense growth rate, we just grow the revenues faster. And
so, again, to the point you hit out, which is really important to me, is, like, you look at all those 234 people that
have yet to consolidate their whole growth rate, I've got 100% of that expense run rate with the revenue coming.
And so, again, as long as we believe we're going to continue to hire people and they're going to continue to move
those books of business, which I do, then you don't fear elevated non-interest expense growth rate, we're really
concerned about revenue growth and EPS growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah, that makes sense. I appreciate [indiscernible] (00:51:10) bankers, because they're doing a great job, it's a

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you commented that if the yield curve slopes more favorably in the
coming quarters that could lead to a better 2025 revenue outlook. But if the yield curve doesn't become more
positively slope than it currently is, for example, if loan rates continue to decline, to what degree would that impact
the optimism you have for next year's revenue outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Tony, thanks for the question. I think you're getting at why we want to try to pursue as neutral balance sheet as
we can. And you know this as well as I do, [indiscernible] (00:52:06) assumptions that go into that. But life just
gets harder with an inverted curve and has been hard over the last couple of years in dealing with that and trying
to manage the spread target over the last couple of years.
We think we're advantaged because of the neutrality of our balance sheet. We think we can manage through it if
the inverted curve continues to just kind of lag along during 2025. But we can always be hopeful, and it looks like
that we've got some reason to be hopeful of that at some point in 2025. And when we talk about an inverted
curve, just to be candid, we're talking about from the overnight rate to probably around five years, so if we can get
a traditional sleep curve there, we think that's good news for us and probably a lot of bankers as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q

Thank you. And then my follow up on slide – just going back to slide 21, the cumulative growth capacity there you
highlighted in deposits and loans for 2025 and 2026, do the numbers you have on the bar, the $5.9 billion and
$5.6 billion for loans represent the blue sky scenario that you expect to come on to the balance sheet over the

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. One follow up on just the NII outlook. I mean, if you have the ability to grow the balance
sheet at a double-digit pace into next year, is there any reason, and I know it's all maybe dependent on the yield
curve, but, I mean, is there any reason to believe that we can't grow NII at a double-digit pace as we move into
next year? Or is it safer to kind of do this high-single digit level that we saw in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Catherine, for us, there is strong correlation to loan growth, percentage growth as well as NII percentage growth,
probably because the way our margin performs and how tight it is. But I think if you look out over the last several
years, they would be closely correlated. So, we're not ready to put out kind of a loan growth target for next year.
But we are optimistic that we should do better than what we're doing this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that's great. And then on fees, that was a really great beat this quarter and kind of higher guide for 2024.
Can you talk little bit about, especially I've noticed your service charges are coming in higher. And I'm assuming
this is just account growth, but just any kind of commentary there, and then maybe your outlook for growth in
service charges? And in this quarter, or maybe I can even say like in the back half of 2024 fee run rate, is there
anything that feels elevated that we need to be aware of to kind of pull back as we model 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think – well, we touched on it a little bit in the comments around some fair value adjustments for other
equity investments and some gain on sale of fixed assets that are in the third quarter, that we don't know what the
fourth quarter is going to show up as, but we're not planning on that kind of those numbers repeating.
Going into 2025, we think the core businesses ought to grow at a reasonable rate next year, whether it be wealth
management or mortgage or what have you, we will have a full year of growing revenues next year as well. So,
we're optimistic about where fees could be next year. As far as deposit service charges, a lot of it was related to
our commercial analysis accounts. And if you've been [indiscernible] (00:56:46) a long time like we have, the
devil's in the details, and it's going back through that file and making sure that you're getting paid the right fees for
the right service levels. And we've done a lot of that over the course of the year, negotiating with clients that use a
lot of treasury management to make sure that we're getting paid a fair price for what we're delivering.

Hey, good morning. I just wanted to [indiscernible] (00:57:26) specifically the investment services line item. And I
just wanted to, I guess, ask for some commentary on what you think the run rate is here? It seems like based on
just the AUM numbers, you're getting better at monetizing that again. And so I wanted to see if some of that is
impacted by private banker hires or just how to think about that business level over the next couple of years
even?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes, it's very much impacted by hiring and the ability of those recent hires to bring their books of business to
Pinnacle. We run a dual platform with Raymond James, so they're the backbone to that, but it's getting – they've
transferred to our platform, and particularly like in Jacksonville, we've had great success in Jacksonville with
recent hires. And so we fully intend to see that line item continue to grow. Is that what you were after, Sam?

I'm sorry, I might have been on mute there. So, as you bring the private bankers over, I guess, how quickly do the
brokerage accounts come over as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, let me make sure I clarify. So, we have private bankers that typically – most typically control the relationship.
And then we hire brokers and we hire trust administrators that both are involved in product specialties that were
generally paid as a function of whatever the assets under management are. And so, we're hiring across all of
those fronts, the private bankers, the brokers, and the trust administrators. I think on that investment services line,
that's primarily about the commissions, which 90% of that commission income is an advisory fee, it's not
transaction commissions, it's an advisory fee.
And so, again, we've been extraordinarily successful with the brokers that we've hired, the Series 7 licensed
brokers, consolidating both [indiscernible] (00:59:44) and I think in Jacksonville, where we've been less than 12
months, they have brought a number of like $600 million in assets. And so, again, just give you some sense, man,
you can drive revenues up pretty quickly when you're making those kinds of hires. And so we're hiring like that all
over the footprint.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Just one last one really quickly on the bond book, Harold, I guess, can you
comment on, seems like you have more variable rate now. Are you hoping to keep that bond book shorter, or are
you hoping to extend it out a little bit to capture sort of the background of the yield curve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think we like where it is currently, Sam. I don't see us growing it. I don't see the duration extending on it.
We are picking up quite a bit of yield out of it where it is. I think when we looked at variable versus fixed, when we
acquired a lot of those hedges to convert it more to variable, we got a lot of running room in front of us before, but

particularly with respect to where rates go. If rates continue to fall, we've got still quite a bit of yield that we can
pick up before rates fall to a level, to where the fixed rate decision would have been a better decision, if you can
follow that. That sounds like a lot of words, Sam. But at the end of the day, we're picking up quite of bit of yield out
of that variable rate bond book and we'll continue to pick up that yield until rates fall quite a bit.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brian Martin from Janney Montgomery. Your line is
live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Couple quick ones for me. Just, Harold, on the margin, just on the loans that reprice
immediately with rates, can you remind us what that is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
The loans that – say that again, Brain, the loans that reprice immediately?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
...with rate cuts, what will move immediately as rates cut on the loan side? I know you talked about the fixed rates
that are going to continue to move higher, but just in terms of rates declining on the variable rate loans, kind of the
variable rate loan percentage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:02:11) credit will reprice immediately. And that's about – are you looking for variable rate,
Brian?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So that would be probably about 30% of the variable rate loans. It's about 14% of total loans.

Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
14%...

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
They're repriced daily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Daily. Got you. Okay. Perfect. And then, just one question, I know you're not commenting a lot about the loan
growth outlook, but just in terms of 2025, just in terms of the mix, like this year we've seen that the focus on
reducing the CRE exposure, as we look to next year, does the mix of loan growth looks similar or should – I guess
it seems like it would include a bit more, from your comments earlier Harold, that CRE maybe at the back half of
next year of 2025 or just how we should be thinking about that in terms of your comments also about maybe
looking for a little bit better loan growth next year than this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think so. We don't expect to see any kind of big uptick in construction or commercial real estate
investment property likely until, call it, the last half of the year as you say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
For next year. Okay. Got you. Okay. And then, just the deposit growth was very strong this quarter. Just, was any
part of that, and you guys have been focused on the deposit verticals, was some of that driven by those verticals
or was there anything outsized in terms of contributing to that growth this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I think it's largely in those verticals and the business model that we put forth with those verticals where we've
got experts in those industries that are across the footprint, helping relationship managers garner those deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Okay. And last two for me, just housekeeping, Harold. Just the tax rate, how to think about that?
And I think you said on the fee income side, the only two really non-recurring, non-sustainable numbers to think
about are that, you know, the securities – the equity investments and the gains this quarter, about the $2 million in
gains this quarter, everything else is pretty repeatable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We feel pretty good. We've kind of dug into that fee base pretty hard to try to figure out what the run rate
might look like, and those are the two items that kind of came to the top.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And then the tax rate, how to think about the tax rate going forward?

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tim Mitchell from Raymond James. Your line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Tim in for Michael. Just one question on deposits, you kind of just talked
about the indexed portion of the portfolio, but on the CD portion, I was hoping you could shed some color on the
maturity schedule, kind of the roll-off rate, the renewal rate as we move into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, generally about 80% of our CD book is one year or less and about 50% of our CD book is three months or
less. So, that's how it kind of flows year in and year out. Sometimes brokered deposits, we will extend it out with
brokered money just to kind of get some fixed rate liabilities on the books. But just kind of the [indiscernible]
(01:06:13) that time deposit book will be – half of it will be three months and about another, call it, 30% to 40% will
be maturing over the next nine months after that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. And then, just one more on the target rate for [indiscernible] (01:06:29). So you've taken
that down a bit from the previous range. [indiscernible] (01:06:34) expectation for lower rates, but also maybe
some competition, just hoping you could kind of shed some light on what those conversations with borrowers are
like and how you would expect that to trend as rates presumably continue moving lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, you're absolutely right on that. We did lower the target rates into something that we think is more
competitive. We're also seeing a lot more inbound traffic for, call it, private wealth mortgages and the like. And we
think with these target ranges, our relationship managers will be more inclined to negotiate with borrowers and try
to secure some of that business for us. In the past, our target ranges were probably on the high end of the market
and we felt like we were missing out on some loan growth because our relationship managers were hesitant to try
to negotiate with borrowers when we were [indiscernible] (01:07:34) others.
