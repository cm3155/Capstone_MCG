Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're all safe and well. Thank you for joining Webster's third
quarter earnings call. CFO Glenn MacInnes and I will review business, financial and credit performance for the
quarter, after which HSA Bank President Chad Wilkins; and Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer, will join us for
Q&A. As a reminder, our presentation deck includes a supplemental section containing additional information and
disclosures.
We remain focused on managing capital credit and liquidity as we continue to deliver for our customers,
communities and shareholders. We're positioning ourselves for growth and outperformance. Our differentiated
businesses and our engaged bankers, who I'm so proud of, help us win in the marketplace every day.
In a challenging environment, we generated meaningful business activity in the third quarter. Our bankers are
working with our customers and prospects and we are generating new relationships, loans and deposits. Loan
originations were higher than a year ago and our pipelines are solid. HSA Bank is winning more direct to
employer relationships than a year ago. Our operational execution remains strong and we continue to manage
credit and enterprise risk effectively.
Turning to slide 2, pre-provision net revenue of $110.4 million increased 2% from Q2 as revenue grew in excess
of expenses. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.75 compared to $0.57 in Q2 and $1 in the prior year's
third quarter. Our $23 million provision resulted in a reserve build of $11 million. Glenn will walk you through the
assumptions underlying the CECL process and resulting provision for the quarter.
Our third quarter return on common equity was 9% and the return on tangible common equity was 11%. As I
mentioned last quarter, we remain confident in our ability to again sustainably generate economic profit even in
this more economically challenging and lower interest rate environment. I'll provide further perspective in a few
minutes.
Loans grew 12% from a year ago, on slide 3, or 5% when excluding $1.4 billion in PPP loans. Commercial loans
grew more than 10% from a year ago or by almost $1.2 billion, led by growth of more than $900 million in high-
quality commercial real estate loans. The decline in floating and periodic rate loans to total loans compared to a
year ago reflects the $1.3 billion of fixed rate PPP loans added in the second quarter. Deposits grew 16% year-
over-year driven across all business lines. Core deposits exceeded $4.3 billion and represent 90% of total
deposits compared to 86% a year ago, while CDs declined $685 million from a year ago.
Slide 4 through 6 set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business. Commercial Banking is on
slide 4. Loan balances increased almost 10% from a year ago, excluding PPP loans. Both investor CRE and C&I
businesses in middle market banking and sponsor and specialty saw a double-digit loan growth year-over-year.
Deposits, up 32% from a year ago, are nearly $6 billion at September 30 as our commercial clients maintain
liquidity on their balance sheets. Commercial deposits were up 11% linked-quarter on seasonal [ph] strength
(00:04:24) in our treasury and payments solutions business, which includes government banking.
HSA Bank is on slide 5. Core deposit growth was 15% year-over-year or 12.6% excluding the impact of the State
Farm transaction which closed in the third quarter and added 22,000 accounts and $132 million in deposit
balances. We continued to see strong increases in new direct to employer business opportunities throughout the
quarter, winning more new HSA RFPs than we did last year, specifically in the large employer space.

COVID-19 has impacted the HSA business, with new account openings 28% lower from prior year when adjusting
for the State Farm acquisition. This is consistent with the industry and is due to slower hiring trends across our
employer customers. HSA consumer spending increased in the quarter, a trend we expect to continue as elective
medical services continue to open up across the country. This spending rebound had a favorable impact on
interchange revenue when compared to Q2.
TPA accounts and balances declined $41,000 and $64 million, respectively, linked quarter, continuing the
outmigration of accounts that we disclosed a year ago. In the quarter, we recognized approximately $3 million of
account closure fees related to the outmigration. Performance fundamentals of HSA Bank and the broader HSA
market remain strong, with ample opportunity for continued growth. And while it's too early to forecast the
upcoming January 1 enrollment season, we're pleased with the large direct to employer wins we've recorded in
this challenging 2020 selling season.
I'm now on slide 6. Community Banking loans grew almost 10% year-over-year and declined slightly, excluding
PPP. Business Banking loans grew 5% from a year ago when excluding PPP. Personal Banking loans decreased
3% from a year ago as an increase in residential mortgages was offset by declines in home equity and other
consumer loans. Community Banking deposits grew 12% year-over-year, with consumer and business deposits
growing 6% and 32%, respectively. The total cost of Community Banking deposits was 24 basis points in the
quarter, that's down 48 basis points from a year ago.
Net interest and noninterest income both improved 3% from prior year driven by increased loan and deposit
balances and by mortgage banking and swap fees, respectively. Self-service transactions declined slightly linked
quarter as we expanded and opened banking centers with enhanced safety protocols but grew year-over-year
reflecting the continued shift in consumer preference to digital channels.
The next two slides address credit metrics and trends. Our September 30 reported credit metrics remain favorable
and actually improved modestly, which Glenn will review in more detail. While pleased with the reported metrics,
we nonetheless remain appropriately cautious on credit as we continue to operate through the considerable
uncertainties presented by the pandemic.
On slide 7, we've updated our disclosure on the commercial loan sectors most directly impacted by COVID,
including payment deferral information. The key points on this slide are that overall loan outstandings to these
sectors have declined 5% from June 30 and the payment deferrals have declined $282 million or 57%.
On slide 8 we provide more detail across our entire $20 billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio. The key
takeaway here is that payment deferrals declined by 65% to $482 million at September 30 and now represent 2%
of total loans compared to 7% at June 30. Consistent with industry trends, we've had meaningful declines in
payment deferrals in every loan category from June 30 to September 30. Of the $482 million of payment deferrals
at September 30, $251 million or 52% are first-time deferrals.
CARES Act and Interagency Statement payment deferrals, which are included in the $482 million of total payment
deferrals at September 30, decreased to 62% from June 30 and now total just $283 million. While pandemic
related challenges remain, we are pleased to have been able to provide considerable support to our customers
and communities under our mission to help individuals, families and businesses achieve their financial goal.
As I stated last quarter, we are actively monitoring risk. We are making real-time credit rating decisions and
addressing potential credit issues proactively. We continue to feel good about the quality of our risk selection, our
underwriting, our portfolio management capabilities, and the strength of our capital and credit allowance positions.

I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll begin with our average balance sheet on slide 9. Average securities grew $184 million or 2.1%
linked quarter and represented 27% of total asset at September 30, largely in line with levels over the past year.
Average loans grew $262 million or 1.2% linked quarter. PPP loans averaged $1.3 billion in Q3 and grew $403
million from Q2, reflecting the full quarter impact of loans funded last quarter. We had no forgiveness activity on
PPP loans during the quarter, and therefore, no acceleration of deferred fees. During the quarter, we had $5.5
million of PPP fee accretion and the remaining deferred fees total $35 million.
Apart from PPP loans, commercial real estate loans increased $124 million or 2%, while asset-based and other
commercial loans decreased $108 million and $38 million, respectively. The $119 million decline in consumer
loans includes $62 million in home equity and $32 million in residential mortgages. Deposits increased $1 billion
linked quarter, well in excess of the combined growth of $446 million in loans and securities.
We saw increases across all of deposit categories except CDs, which declined $280 million or nearly 10%. The
cost of CDs declined 36 basis points and was a significant driver of our reduction in deposit costs. Public funds
increased to $599 million in a seasonally strong third quarter, while the cost of these deposits declined from 35
basis points to 18 basis points.
Borrowings declined $744 million from Q2 and now represents 7% of total assets, compared to 8.5% at June 30,
and 10.5% in prior year. Regulatory risk-weighted capital ratios increased due to growth in equity. The tangible
common equity ratio increased to 7.75%, that would be 34 basis points higher excluding the $1.4 billion in 0%
risk-weighted PPP loans. Tangible book value per share at quarter-end was $27.86, an increase of 1.7% from
June 30, and 4.8% from prior year.
Slide 10 summarizes our income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings. Net interest income declined $5.1
million from prior quarter. Lower rates resulted in a quarter-over-quarter decline of $16.7 million in interest income
from earning asset. This was partially offset by $7.9 million due to lower deposit and borrowing cost and $3.7
million as a result of loan and security balance growth. As a result, our net interest margin was 11 basis points
lower linked quarter. Core loan yields and balances contributed 14 basis points to the decline, with PPP loans
contributing another 2 basis points in the decline.
Lower reinvestment rates on our securities portfolio resulted in 3 basis points of NIM compression, while higher
premium amortization resulted in an additional 4 basis points of NIM compression. This was partially offset by a
10 basis point reduction in deposit cost, reflective of reduced rates across all categories, which benefited NIM by
10 basis points. And fewer borrowings contributed another 2 basis points of NIM benefit.
As compared to prior year, net interest income declined $21 million. $65 million of the decline was the net result of
lower market rate, which were partially offset by $44 million in earning asset growth. Noninterest income
increased $15 million linked quarter and $5.2 million from prior year. HSA fee income increased $4.1 million
linked quarter. Interchange revenue increased $1 million, driven by a 12% linked quarter increase in debit
transaction volume.
We also recognized $3.2 million of exit fees on TPA accounts during the quarter. The mortgage banking revenue
increase of $2.9 million linked quarter was split between increased origination activity and higher spread. Deposit

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
service fees increased $1.5 million quarter-over-quarter driven by overdraft and interchange fees. Consumer and
business debit transactions increased 16% linked quarter.
Other income increased $5.7 million primarily due to a discrete fair value adjustment on our customer hedging
book recorded last quarter. The increase in non-interest income for prior year reflects higher mortgage banking
revenue and HSA fee income, partially offset by lower deposit service and loan related fees. Reported non-
interest expense of $184 million included $4.8 million of professional fees driven by our strategic initiatives, which
John will review in more detail.
We also saw a linked quarter increase of $4.3 million from higher medical cost due to an increase in utilization.
Non-interest expense increased $4.1 million or 2.3% from prior year. The efficiency ratio remained at 60%. Pre-
provision net revenue was $110 million in Q3. This compares to $108 million in Q2 and $131 million in prior year.
The provision for credit loss for the quarter was $22.8 million, which I will discuss in more detail on the next slide.
And our effective tax rate was 20.9% compared to 21.8% in Q2.
Turning to slide 11, I'll review the results of our third quarter allowance for loan losses under CECL. As
highlighted, the allowance for credit losses to loans increased to 1.69% or 1.8% excluding PPP loans. We have
summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario which reflect the gradual improvement in
employment with real GDP returning to pre-COVID levels in 2022. The forecast improved slightly from prior
quarter but was offset by commercial risk rating migration resulting in a provision of $23 million. The $370 million
allowance reflects our estimate of life of loan losses as of September 30. We will continue to assess the effects of
credit quality, loan modifications and the macroeconomic conditions as we move through the pandemic.
Slide 12 highlights our key asset quality metrics as of September 30. Non-performing loans in the upper left
decreased $10 million from Q2. Commercial real estate, residential mortgage and consumer each saw linked
quarter declines, while commercial increased $3 million. Net charge-offs in the upper right decreased from second
quarter and totaled $11.5 million after $4.3 million in recoveries.
C&I gross charge-offs declined slightly and totaled $12 million, primarily reflecting credits that we're already
experiencing difficulty prior to the onset of the pandemic. Commercial classified in the lower left represented 332
basis points of total commercial loans. This compares to a 20 quarter average of 315 basis points. And the
allowance for credit losses increased to $370 million as discussed on the prior slide.
Slide 13 highlights our liquidity metrics. Our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with
considerable flexibility. Deposit growth of $565 million exceeded total asset growth and lowered the loan to
deposit ratio to 81%. Our sources of secured borrowing capacity increased further and totaled $11.7 billion at
September 30.
Slide 14 highlights our strong capital metrics. Regulatory capital ratios exceeded well-capitalized levels by
substantial amounts. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.23% exceeds well-capitalized by more than $1 billion.
Likewise, Tier 1 risk-based capital exceeds well-capitalized levels by $870 million.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect stable loan balances with modest PPP forgiveness. Assuming a flat rate
environment with an average one month LIBOR in the range of 15 basis points and an average 10-year treasury
swap rate around 70 basis points, we believe we are near the bottom of core NIM compression. Noninterest
income will likely be lower linked quarter due to reduction in mortgage banking income and lower HSA fees on
TPA accounts. Core noninterest expense will remain in the range of Q3 and our tax rate will be around 21%.

With that, I'll turn things back over to John for a review of our strategic initiatives.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. I'm now on slide 15 and 16. As I've mentioned on recent earnings calls, we have been and remain
focused on revenue enhancements and operational efficiencies across the organization. Well before the onset of
the pandemic, our management team recognized that we would be operating in a low interest rate and more
challenging business environment for an extended period of time.
In January, we began an enterprise-wide assessment of our organization to identify revenue opportunities and
cost savings using a very thorough and systematic process. The onset of the pandemic in March further impacted
the operating environment and accelerated changes in customer preferences and shifting workplace dynamics.
This not only made our commitment to this process that much stronger, but it also expanded the opportunities we
have to rationalize and align our expenses with our business line execution.
We've identified and begun to implement dozens of initiatives across the bank, a handful of which are set forth on
slide 16, that will result in driving incremental revenue, reducing our overall cost structure and enhancing our
digital capabilities to meet our customers' needs and to reduce our cost of delivery of products and services. Our
focus remains first on key revenue and asset growth drivers, including accelerating growth in commercial bank by
building on our proven track record in select specialized industries, driving HSA Bank growth through improved
sales productivity and customer retention, and continuing to grow in community core markets through product
enhancements.
We are also focused on efficiency and organizational alignment, simplifying our org structure, capturing targeted
back office synergies and redesigning and automating critical processes. We also are rationalizing and
consolidating our retail and corporate real estate footprint. Through this process, we will continue to improve the
customer experience by enhancing digital capabilities, modernizing foundational systems, and improving
analytical capabilities.
We have begun executing on many of these initiatives and we recently made a series of organizational changes
to position us for success over the next year and well beyond. We plan to provide more detailed information on
these initiatives, including additional financial details and timing on realization, on our fourth quarter earnings call
in January, as we are continuing to work through all of the final decision.
What I will say is that with respect to efficiency opportunities, we anticipate reducing our current expense base by
8% to 10%, fully realized on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of next year. We see considerable opportunity
above and beyond that as revenue initiatives and further efficiency gains are realized late in 2021 and in 2022.
As we stated last quarter, we remain confident that even if the current operating environment persists, with low
interest rates and economic uncertainty, that execution on our identified revenue enhancements and efficiency
opportunities will allow us to sustainably generate returns in excess of our estimated 10% of cost of capital by the
end of 2021. Our vision remains consistent and it's to strengthen our position as a major regional bank in the
Northeast that lead with a distinctive and expanding commercial business, and aggressively growing and winning
national HSA Bank business, a strong community bank franchise in our core markets, all supported by an efficient
and scalable operating model. I want to say a big thank you to all of our bankers for their incredible work during
these challenging times.
With that Maria; Glenn, Chad, Jason and I are prepared to take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question is from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please proceed.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Hi, good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Steve, how are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. John, I want to understand the comments around reducing the expense base. So this 8% to 10% reduction
that, if we look at this quarter's expense it's about $65 million, $66 million would be the midpoint, are you saying
by 4Q of next year that will be in the run rate? Is that the expectation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Right. And I think we can outperform that Steve, but we're absolutely confident to put that bogey out there. So I
think you have the quarterly expense base a little bit lower, Glenn can talk about that. But that's exactly what we
mean. So if you look at third quarter kind of core expenses, we expect to achieve a 10% reduction in those
expenses by the fourth quarter of next year.

Run rate perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Our stated core – our GAAP expenses for the quarter, $183 million, almost $184 million. And there were some
onetime cost in there. But you can use those as [ph] approximate (00:23:02).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
As a base, okay. So and that will obviously help with 2022. But as you think about next year, I think we're all
struggling with what pre-tax pre-provision income growth could be for everyone, right? And Glenn, it's helpful that
NIM is close to a bottom. But could you frame for us – obviously, this is going to set up a better situation two
years from now. But talk to us about the ability to grow pre-tax pre-provision next year.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Steve, I'll give you a little – obviously, we're not going to provide detailed guidance, but I'll give you a little bit of
perspective. In the fourth quarter we'll talk as we work through our final analytics and make final decisions we'll be
able to provide you with kind perspective. In the fourth quarter, we'll talk – as we work through our final analytics
and make final decisions, we'll be able to provide you with kind of our quarterly realization of expense saves and
revenue enhancement. So we will see progressive improvement in our operations over the course of 2021, so it
doesn't all just magically appear at the end of the year.
I think from a top line perspective, the – we think that we're roughly at the bottom of NIM compression if rates kind
of stay where they are. We have confidence that we'll be able to grow assets. Fees are hard to predict in this
environment, and obviously provision from a net income perspective, I know you asked about PPNR, is kind of a
wild card from a profitability perspective.
So our full plan is to improve incremental profitability and PPNR each of the quarters in 2021. So we're not kicking
the can forward, but we wanted to put a stake in the ground of what we expect to do from sort of a structural
realignment of the way we operate into 2022. So I would say stay tuned for more details in our January call. But
also we fully expect, if the operating environment stayed stable, that we would see incremental improvement in
each of the quarters in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And, Steve, the only thing I would add to that is, and it's not poor, but as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we
have about $35 million in deferred fees in PPP, and we expect during the course of 2021 most of that would
probably be forgiven. So that will impact earnings as well up to, say, $33 million, $35 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And to shift to credit – actually, before I ask my question, if we look at the COVID-19-
impacted loan slide, do those balances include any leveraged loans, or are those outside of those buckets? And
then I have one question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Those are all sector-based and they would include any ones we have related to those segments. Jason, I don't
know whether you want to put a more color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, no. Both slides include leveraged loans, both on the sector slide, and if you look at the next page, leverage
is actually broken out separately. So, you can see the detail there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. So, I think some were adding leverage on top of those but that's already included. Okay. That's
helpful.

That's correct. Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So now – I mean we've been looking at this slide now for two quarters. Can you talk to us in terms of the deeper
dive you've done at the portfolio and where you're now most concerned for losses? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure, Steve. Jason, I'll go right to you and then maybe I'll make some comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So when we think about overall losses – look, we do a deep dive, we have weekly meetings with the lines
of business to assess modifications, deferrals, trends, get a lot of color from our borrowers because we're having
conversations regularly. If you think about in terms of total losses, think about the – in the near term, I would say
it's going to be the troubled sector that we're all focused on.
We had some credits that were pushed over the edge initially that we're having trouble before COVID. Going
forward, it's going to be the sectors that were – that everybody is focused on, being hotels, travel and leisure,
media, restaurants. But going forward, I guess what I would say generally is, I'm a little concerned about the
business banking, small business portfolio. But if you look at the DDA deposits for those borrowers overall, at [ph]
$930 million (00:27:18) versus pre-COVID, they're actually very healthy and deferrals overall are sort of going
down. So you feel cautiously encouraged at the moment in terms of how that portfolio is going to perform.
So, I think there are pockets of risk throughout the portfolio that we're focusing on, but I don't see any area where
we have significant concentration that I'm overly concerned about. So we had a good quarter in terms of third
quarter – in terms of charges and NPLs. I think those numbers will likely get a bit worse throughout 2021 before
they return to normalized levels. But I continue to be cautiously encouraged. And I think that the likelihood of
some additional stimulus given the rise in cases throughout the country will also be helpful and necessary at
some level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jason. I'd say, Steve, if you look at our slight tick-up in classifieds, the biggest contributors were those
sectors that Jason just referenced. We do look at whether or not we need specific reserves on those credits. We
don't have a lot of identified embedded loss. So I do think there are some wildcards about path of the virus, about
the level of stimulus. But I, too, agree with Jason that it's really sector-based. We're not seeing any differences in
performance across geographies, business units, or those elements or product type. It really relates to whether a
sector needs people to gather and be close together and travel. So I think those are the big keys. And fortunately,
relative to our peers, we've got lower exposure in those categories which we're happy about.

Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
This is great color on the expense plan and certainly a great plan. So appreciate that. John, you had alluded to
that maybe in the beginning of next year we'll get a little bit more color. And just curious kind of broadly, I know
you put it in the slides, but just broadly where you're going to see kind of some of those savings come. I know you
mentioned real estate rationalization or – is there any more color you can offer, just kind of broadly, as to where
you see those expense reductions coming?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's just difficult in terms of where we are in the process to give specifics because some final decisions
haven't been made. But I think you're right. If you look at our retail branch network, if you look at our corporate
space with the changing work environment, we expect to gain material efficiencies in those categories. We're also
automating manual processes, combining like functions across HSA and Webster and creating centers of
excellence that not only we believe will bring us efficiencies, but as importantly, Collyn, will make our ability to
deliver for our customers better and take out defects.
And so we're pretty excited about some of the preliminary work we're doing. And we're prepared to put the cost
bogey out there because we've been working on this for 10 or 11 months. Glenn referenced the additional
expense related to the project. We're obviously using professionals and outside help to go through this process
and we think it will change the way we do business and transform the organization. So, we look forward to sharing
more in the first quarter on our call but we're not really prepared to go any deeper right now.

Okay. Okay. And then just in terms of kind of your outlook for loan growth, with the comment that you made, the
intention is to try to continually to build PPNR next year. Any – where do you see the opportunities to kind of grow
the loan book, either from a geographic perspective or from a loan segmentation perspective?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think that's a great question and I'll relate it a little bit to Steve's question on credit performance, that it
really ends up being sector-based, and we're fortunate, as we said before, to have either been really good or a
combination of lucky and good in where we play. So we don't have a lot of – we're not relying on a lot of oil and
gas. We're not relying on leisure, hotels. And so we've been focused as you know in healthcare, technology and
technology infrastructure which is our largest exposure in the sponsor and specialty business. And it's not only
performed brilliantly during the pandemic, but it's actually accelerated. So, we had $173 million in new originations
in sponsor and specialty in Q3. Our commercial real estate's been really good. We've been focusing a lot on albeit
lower earning, but really high-quality institutional government transactions in our middle market group. So we had
$531 million in commercial bank originations in the quarter which sort of is similar to what we had in Q1 before the
pandemic really set in.
So, I think for us, there's no question that loan demand is going to be muted. That's just the way it's going to be
because I think there's going to be uncertainty, not as much corporate confidence and investment. And I think
even individuals as you know are keeping very liquid right now. So I think demand will be down but I think there
will be pockets and sectors where we play very well where we'll continue to make new loans.
So, and I do think what we said in in our 1Q call that even though before we had seen any behaviors, our guess
was that loan origination would be lower but that prepayments would be lower, that's all coming true. So this
quarter, we saw loan growth on lower originations in commercial and we obviously had kind of really high
mortgage origination.
So, I think we'll still see mortgage. We'll see some growth in personal loans and in commercial in the sectors
where we perform best and where we have great relationships and are not being negatively impacted by the
pandemic. I still think we have confidence that we can grow asset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great. And then just one final question on M&A, and you're welcome to answer it relative to HSA or
the bank. But just curious as to how you guys are thinking about potential acquisitions as you look out, need for
scale, obviously you're addressing it within your own organization, but what kind of opportunities are a little bit
longer term or more broadly for you guys to really increase scale through acquisitions? Again, through either the
core bank or the HSA Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. It's a great question and our comments have evolved over the last couple of years on the calls from a
complete focus internally to a recognition that we do think scale is really important. And so I would say that we're
always looking, you saw the State Farm transaction. There are other transactions like that in the marketplace that
we look at all the time.
With respect to HSA portfolio acquisitions teams of commercial bankers, those are things we would act on
regardless of what the environment is. And we do think that there is a higher likelihood that we would be engaged
in some sort of bank M&A on the other side of this. And so what you see right now is our laser focus on making
sure that we are recognizing our potential from PPNR perspective and evaluation perspective by focusing on
being the best we can be, scalable and nimble, which I think will put us in a really good position because we
12


Webster Financial Corp.

believe that there will be more M&A in the mid-cap bank space coming out the other side of this. And we want to
make sure we're controlling our destiny and as I said, we'd never say never. We're focused internally now but we
do want to gain scale when there is clear visibility on the other side of credit through this pandemic.

Hey, guys. Good morning.

Mark, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just to follow up on one, maybe for Jason, I know it's hard to sort of estimate, there's lots of variables at this point,
but based on what you see today, how are you thinking about provisioning levels in, say, the fourth quarter and
beyond?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, sure. I could start, and maybe Glenn you want to jump in as well. So, when you think about some of the
bigger drivers, ratings migration, right, you saw we had some migration to classified this quarter. I would say, as
we got a view into revenue recovery in the third quarter from a lot of our borrowers, right? Many of them
recovered very quickly. Some of them, we realized, it's going to take a little bit longer. Those are the ones that we
downgraded to classified.
I feel like at this point we've got to book well rated and we'll probably be calling balls and strikes over the next few
quarters. So, I don't see a major level of migration at this point. Some of the situations in special mention, they
may deteriorate but you'll probably have just as many if not more that will improve.
So, I don't see a huge pressure barring an increase in cases or something falls apart in terms of additional
stimulus. I don't see a huge pressure on reserves in the short term, but obviously, that could change based on the
environment.

Mark, let me just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:37:02) add anything to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Mark, I will. This is John and then I'll let Glenn provide the [ph] technically – and just from top of the house
(00:37:07), I think this quarter, Mark, is a really nice demonstration of kind of the way the process is supposed to
work. We had very little aggregate loan growth. So, you think about the portfolio not growing that much, which
means you didn't need to increase your provision for life of loan losses for a lot of incremental exposure. You saw
the Moody's outlook that us and many of our peers used sort of get marginally to more favorable. So that didn't
require – we kind of look at it to flat to slightly better. Some of the qualitative factors around the level of
modifications and everything came down. So that would require lower.
And then, you saw a little bit of drift into classified some internal risk rating migration lower, which kind of offsets
those other positives. And lo and behold, we had $11 million in net charge-offs. We built our reserve a little bit. So
it really depends on how fast we can grow loans going into next year, what happens in our risk migration and what
the path of the virus does to Moody's forward look to really give you an indication of kind of where we might be
from a provisioning perspective. Glenn?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No, I think between you and Jason you covered it. The only thing I would add is that most of us are using – in the
mid-cap space, we're using the Moody baseline forecast. And just keep in mind, that has about $1.5 trillion in
stimulus built into it, so plus or minus, depending on what happens there.
But as John and Jason both pointed out, I mean I see it more as – we look at the thing from a duration standpoint.
And right now, liquidity seems good, customer seems strong but it's all going to be a matter of the course of the
pandemic and liquidity. And so, we're keeping a very close eye on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then secondly, it looked like – I mean, the deferral trends look terrific. I guess I'm curious, is there
dramatic differences across the various geographies that you all traffic in as New York and – New York City being
much harder hit? [ph] Are the (00:39:01) deferral rates much higher than they are, say, in Connecticut or [ph]
upper (00:39:04)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting. And I'll ask Jason obviously for his comment. But, Mark, it's funny and I just mentioned that
when Steve asked the question, we haven't seen real differences in geographies. It's been much more sector
based, right? It's not whether you're in New York or Boston; it's whether you're a hotel or a multi-use facility in real
estate. So it's definitely more sector driven. And I will remind folks, it's interesting, and I have to mention Bill
Wrang's name on every earnings call, I think that's a trend. But he was never one to dive into New York City.
We've got significant real estate exposure in New Jersey and down into Philadelphia and then up into Boston and
14


Webster Financial Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Connecticut, but we don't have – we're not going to overweight in the metro areas, if you will. So we haven't seen
the kind of risk in New York multifamily or other areas. So geographies haven't really impacted us.
I will tell you anecdotally, and I know Mark you live in New Canaan, I think, we have seen a precipitous increase
in home values in Northern Westchester and Fairfield County as evidenced by some of REO properties and other
things. So it's been pretty spectacular, the growth outside of the metro market which has stabilized and taken any
risk we had, had in terms of home prices in our core market kind of out. But that's really the only geographic – the
thing that I've seen is a little bit of flight from metro and an impact on home prices and rents. Jason?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think you mostly hit it. I guess what I would say is initially, right, if you look at the deferrals that we got
in our consumer book, there was certainly a disproportionate amount in New York, right? Early on, New York
wasn't doing so well. But at this point, you saw our consumer deferrals decline to under $100 million, and overall
we're feeling better about the portfolio. I actually think there's been some benefit within our footprint because of
the stronger relative numbers at this point, so the portfolio is like business banking, mid-market, right, and a good
portion of commercial real estate I think have also benefit from that throughout this period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then the last question I had, I know John you said it's a little early to talk about renewal season but I'm not
sure if Chad's on the line, if he could give any color on sort of what he's seeing, how the pipeline is shaping up
and also maybe help us think through any potential ramifications on the HSA business in the event that we do see
a blue wave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Great questions, Mark. I'll take the blue wave question and then Chad can give the rest. We've been studying a
lot, spending a lot of time with the lobbyists in Washington, and we really do feel good and we can say with
confidence that even in the CARES Act there were discussions about how we could leverage the HSA account
product to help. And so I think there is kind of bipartisan support for HSA going forward as a really good tool to
allow people to kind of deal with healthcare costs and even have an HSA as part of a Medicare program at some
point. So our view right now is that with respect to the still low probability of a complete replacement of our private
insurance system with a single payer program and a lot of the talk that's going on that could benefit HSAs, we feel
like politically, we're in pretty good shape regardless of what the outcomes of the November election are.
Chad, maybe you can provide some guidance and details on what you're seeing as you head into the January 1
period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, John. Thanks, Mark. I agree with John, your comments on the political environment. I think under
Obamacare, HSAs were largely – there was very limited impact and we grew quite a bit during that administration.
So I think it's more likely we're going to have a positive impact than negative.
With regard to sales results, we're really happy with what we're seeing at this point in the year for [ph] one-one
(00:42:59), particularly in the large employer direct space. And we've had 12 large employer wins and our pipeline
15


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
in the closed contracting section of the pipeline is more than two times what it was at this point last year. So we're
really happy with the results that we're seeing in the area where I think everybody on this call know we've been
investing in sales, marketing, and product capabilities to drive these kind of results in the channels that we can
influence directly. And so we're happy to see those results.
That said, I want people to keep in mind that 80% of our accounts come from existing employers. And you heard
John mentioned that due to the pandemic and a weaker labor market, we've seen about 28% decrease in
enrollments. They've come back somewhat here at the end of the third quarter. But we're still not seeing a strong
enrollments yet from our large employers or our existing employers. We expect that to come back as the
economy rebounds. But while we're under [indiscernible] (00:44:03) stress, that'll be subdued.
Also, a couple of our large health plan providers are under a bit of pressure and we don't have as much visibility
into that segment. So it's hard to call the ball for [ph] one-one (00:44:19). But in the areas where we have visibility
and we can impact it directly, we like what we're seeing.

Hey. Good morning, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I had a follow up first on credit, looking on slide 8 how the percent of the portfolio that is in deferral for leveraged
loans and middle market at 4% for each are the two highest. I was curious when push comes to shove, will
sponsor step up in the leveraged portfolio to support their investments and the equity they have in these deals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
David, I'll provide some overview and then I'll turn it over to Jason. It's always hard, right, to make really strong
statements with conviction. That's one of the reasons we're in this business, and we just recently had a situation
where a 20-year sponsor relationship, they went above and beyond to make sure that the bank was taken care of,
and we were in this business, as you know, through the Great Recession.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
So my comment is that we believe that we are careful to select the sponsors who we do business with. We go
deep with sponsors with expertise and build relationships. And so we have a track record of when the going gets
tough, both parties come together and figure out a solution. So my answer is, yes, there are times where a
sponsor can't put good money after bad if there's something fundamentally flawed with the business. But if your
risk selection is good upfront and you partner with the right sponsors, that is a wonderful secondary, tertiary
support function.
So the other thing I will add, and I've said it before, is that the way to look at it is pretty simple. If a sponsor has
purchased a business in a sector where they feel like there's real value, real growth opportunity, and ability to
create growth, the pandemic, which is a temporary delay, right, there's really not that many paradigm shifts.
Maybe there'll be a paradigm shift in commercial real estate and other areas down the road.
You really have to figure – if we're lending money appropriately at reasonable leverage levels, meaning that
there's significant cash equity, usually and generally much more than the actual debt on the company, that the
borrower is not going to hand you the keys when they're trying to protect a significant amount of investment and
they know that the issues are only temporary.
So unless the business has some sort of fatal flaw, they're going to ride through this with us. We're going to
provide them some sort of deferrals of payments or covenant relief, but they're going to put an additional cash
equity and support the company to make sure at the other side of this temporary issue that we have, not a
permanent one, that they can reach their potential with their company and get a return on their investment.
So long-winded way, but you know that I've thought about this a lot and we've seen it be a benefit to our credit
performance through the Great Recession and early on in the pandemic. Jason, is there anything you want to add
to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I'll give a little bit more specifics, right? So I'll talk about sponsor and leverage together. The majority of
the modifications have been in fact non-payment-related payments down to about 3% on a combined basis and
sponsors in a lot of cases have been supportive. And about a third of what I'll call the more major modifications
that we've done in the portfolio, there's been some level of support provided by the sponsor either cash equity,
sub-debt or guarantee a portion of the debt. And that includes in the restaurant space where we've modified a
handful of loans, about 45%, 50% of those, there has been double-digit equity that's come into these deals or
sub-debt. So, I've been very pleased overall with the performance of the portfolio during this time period and the
support from the sponsors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's great color. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up on the loan growth outlook. So I wanted to reconcile a
couple of comments that you made, on the one hand, you mentioned about the fourth quarter, expect stable loan
balances, and you mentioned about how loan demand is muted. But earlier in the call you mentioned about how
pipelines are solid, and one of the initiatives as we look out to next year's to accelerate commercial loan growth.
So I was curious, is it more of a timing thing that the solid pipeline should lead to an acceleration in loan growth
next year and that the near term clearly sounds like it's flat? Or just curious as to what your thoughts are there.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
David, another really smart question and it's tough. We may never answer questions even pre-pandemic about
this. Kind of what I've said is we really have confidence that the personal loan side in terms of mortgage and
others are very – there's some seasonality to it obviously. And then there's also interest rates impact demand,
refinance activity. When we talk about commercial banking and business banking, we've demonstrated over a
seven or eight-year period of time this ability to grow loans double-digit. But we've had quarters that are show less
growth, maybe seasonality, maybe disproportionate amount of pay downs.
Obviously, right now we're not confident in the double-digit growth environment. There's just not the economic
backdrop and the loan demand there. But again, quarterly, it's going to be interesting. We do have a lot of a big
mortgage pipeline. Our commercial pipeline is solid. It's not what it was the last year at this time but it's better than
the last two quarters. I'll give you a couple dynamics if you're thinking short term.
We do think that there could be some more high originations in the fourth quarter and additional payoffs,
particularly if sponsors in real estate or C&I are looking to do transactions before the end of the year, if they're
concerned about retroactive tax moves by a new government in terms of what might impact 2021. So we do think
the fourth quarter has the potential of being a little bit better from a loan growth perspective. But again, it may be
just better originations and higher payoffs which lead to the same level of modest loan growth.
We are in the early stages of rolling out some new sponsor and specialty industry verticals and middle market
industry verticals. And again, we'll talk more about that in January in earnest. But that'll take a while to ramp up.
So I wouldn't think – and you know us as risk managers, this isn't the time to be going all in, in a new sector. So
you'll see us start to grow those sectors smartly over the course of 2021 and into 2022.
So I think you have to think about originations. You have to think about whether or not there'll be higher
prepayments and whether there are seasonal reasons or political reasons why you might see increased activity.
And then what I would say is we think we can outperform the market with respect to loan growth which will be
somewhat muted.
So I hope that – it may sound inconsistent, but I'm trying to sort of be thoughtful about the short term and the long
term. And I think the best thing to say is we know we've got a track record of being able to grow commercial loans
at the top – in the top decile or top quartile of the market.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just circling back on the credit question. Should we think that as some of those potential
NPL formations or charges, Jason, you talked about coming later in the next few quarters come through, should
we see the [ph] allowances of ratio (00:52:41) then start to come down? Are we fully provided for future charge-
offs or would we likely see charge-offs being covered somewhat by provision? Or can we expect to see that ratio,
the [ph] ALL (00:52:56) ratio start to trickle down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey Jared, I'll take a quick shot and then give it to Jason. Just from a high level, obviously, we feel really good
that we've got all of our identified loss content captured in what is an above market level provision. So I think if
you – if we end up performing at our base case of credit outcome, which as Jason mentioned we do think we'll
see some weakness, then I think the industry generally feels on the lag basis. We could see some cracks in credit
in first Q and 2Q. We feel like we are covered for our base case. And obviously, if the dynamics change or as
Glenn said the path of the virus indicates a longer duration of economic uncertainty, then that could impact the
provisioning going forward. Jason?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think you guys hit all the right points. And I guess, if I look at the situation right now, there are some
accounts that I do expect will – could worsen, right, depending on the length of recovery and overall liquidity to
borrow. But I'm also really cautiously optimistic that there are a lot of borrowers that will improve. So when I look
at it on a net-net basis, putting some of the other factors aside, I don't feel like there will be as much pressure
from a reserving standpoint and I do feel that we're well covered. I know we're sort of near the top of our peers
and so I feel good about where that lies.
So, of course, as I said it's going to depend on the path of the virus, what the new stimulus, assuming it's
approved, looks like and where it's targeted. And the big thing that I know we've also mentioned is consumer
behavior, right? Some of these things like movie theaters, entertainment venues, other things like that, it just
could be a much longer return over time. But at the moment I feel really good about where we're reserved. I think
there's likely to be less pressure and I'm cautiously optimistic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. That's great color. Thanks. And then, you're talking about the potential for higher originations offset by the
payoffs in fourth quarter. When you're looking at new loan originations right now, can you comment on what
you're seeing in terms of pricing or spreads or structure? Are you able to put on – is that incremental loan that's
coming on in a better position for the bank overall whether you look at pricing or structure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Another great question, Jared. I think the short answer is yes right now. I don't know how long that duration
will go. I get write-ups from the business line leaders in the line of businesses within commercial and community
and they all talk about the marketplace. And I did see sort of saying that in this quarter and if we look at the
numbers, we have had better credit spreads for same risk rating. But they've talked about competition coming a
little bit back into the market and people getting a little more aggressive again. So, I don't know how long it'll last
but I will tell you that from a pure statistical perspective, it looks like we got paid more for taking the same risk or
lower risk in structure in the third quarter.
19


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
And again, our spread and our yield is dependent not only on that variable, what we're able to do in terms of
pricing risk, but also on the mix. And so we had pretty solid, in our sponsor and specialty particularly in
technology, pretty terrific yield with good structures. We've got such a fantastic team there and there's not as
much competition from the nonbanks right now. So I think that helped us from a pricing and structure perspective.
We also, as I mentioned, onboarded a lot of kind of government and institutional loans which have significantly
lower yields but really high in kind of investment grade like credit metrics. So, the short answer is mix matters for
us. But the short answer to your question is I think for a period of time we've been able to get better structures at
better pricing. But I don't know how long that'll last depending again on the variability of the economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just finally for me, switching to capital, you're seeing good growth in ratios, TCE this
quarter and then with the expected run off in PPP that should most likely just still get better. How are you thinking
about capital management as you head into maybe, say, head into 2021? Are buybacks attractive as part of that
strategy? Should we be thinking about the dividend or is it still too early to say given the broader uncertainty?

Yeah, I think it's – you kind of characterized at the end, it's too early to say in terms of making the call but I think
you've hit it. We, obviously, because of the economic headwinds, all of the sudden our payout ratio went higher
than our range but we're really confident about our ability to maintain our dividend at its current level. And so, we
think we're going to grow back into that from an earnings perspective and be right in that 40% to 45% range,
which has been our long term target. And we have grown our capital levels. We think it's prudent right now. And
we do think where we sit that it's a little bit premature for a number of reasons to engage in repurchasing our
stock.
We started to in January. We kept talking about supporting loan growth and looking at strategic inorganic
opportunities in HSA and that's why we were sort of delaying. We began – we thought the prudent thing to do
obviously when the pandemic hit was to not repurchase shares. I think when we feel like the coast is clear, given
our capital levels, that will be back on the table.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I believe you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
How are you?

John R. Ciulla A

Okay. Good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just thinking about the 8% to 10% expense save number, that's a net number. I'm just curious, what's the gross
number so we get a good idea of the dollars being reinvested into the other programs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
That is – the 8% to 10% is off our base, and so that is the number. Right. It's not – it is – if you look at our run rate
and look at our core expenses, you would expect it's going to go down 8% to 10%. That includes reinvestment
and all those other...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Correct. So it is the net number, and what you're saying is at some level above that, not materially, right now
we've got the ability, we've invested heavily in a lot of digital automation, business process tools and so we're
leveraging a lot of prior investments to continue to get efficiencies. So we're not announcing simultaneously a
significant investment in go-forward technology. So that gross number is not twice the net number, Matt. It's – that
includes, as Glenn said, the money that we have to reinvest to get everything out of the program.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just framing the loan growth initiatives a little bit more, does it include any material mix
shifts in the composition of the loan book right now? I think you mentioned some of the specialty areas you're in,
the sponsor and specialty books. Should we expect some outsized growth in those areas relative to others? And
does it also include any sort of geographic expansion? Should we expect you to break out of your core northeast
footprint?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Yeah. It's great. Thank you. We've been pretty deliberate over time. And I always tell the story of coming here in
Stamford was the – Stamford, Connecticut was the great western frontier. And we've since moved to Providence
and Boston and White Plains in New York and Philadelphia and Washington D.C. You have noticed that we have
not made a big geographic move over the last handful of years largely because of the competitive dynamics and
most recently, obviously, just kind of the economic landscape.
When we think about commercial, we think about doing things we do well which we've been able to sort of
replicate geographic expansion. So, in our current plans, I don't think you'd see us move into a market at the tail
end of a pandemic because you end up being the lender of last resort and there may be some risk choices there.
I wouldn't take geographic expansion off the table. If you look forward three or five years, I think it's something we
have a core competency in.
But we also think in terms of what we've been able to slowly and smartly and deliberately add new industry
verticals by hiring really talented bankers. And so we're looking to kind of expand our healthcare practice. We're
looking to do more in spaces where we can gather deposits as well as use our balance sheet and make loans. So
I think we'll talk to you a little bit about it more in January.
But the reality is we're thinking like you're thinking which is we're not going to bet the bank on going into new
geographies or new areas where we don't have deep expertise. And even if we do and we're kind of instituting a
different risk profile, it's certainly not going to outgrow the stuff we're doing that we know well. So, I think that's
what you're wanting to hear. I think that's the answer to your question is that you're not going to see us make big
risk choices or go into new industries that are going to meaningfully impact either our credit performance or our
growth in the short term.
We'll dabble. We'll move forward in areas where we think there's protectable, predictable recurring cash flows.
And we'll grow those businesses slowly or we'll move into new geographies and we'll grow them slowly to make
sure that we don't make bad risk choices.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And then, maybe just tying this discussion into M&A, there's a bit more willingness here, at least it
sounds like, to do or think about whole bank M&A. As you think about potential geographic expansion over the
next three to five years, could you acquire into those markets? What would those markets look like? What
markets do you like? And then maybe financially speaking, could you give us some parameters on deals that
would make sense to you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Way too premature, Matt. And I was careful to say that as we said, we've been evolving our view and we think
that there'll be more M&A in the mid-cap space. Right now, we're focused on making sure that we're maximizing
our potential and putting us in a position where if that's on the top five of our priority list as you look forward a year
from now, we will be able to make those choices and make those decisions that you're referring to right now, but
way too premature.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Just last one for me.
