Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter,
Capital One earned $2.4 billion, or $5.62 per diluted common share. The results include one notable item, a $192
million gain from the sale of two card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter.
Period-end loans held for investment grew 1% on a linked quarter basis and average loans grew 3%. Revenue in
the linked quarter increased 1%. Non-interest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by declines in both
marketing and operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $677 million as net charge-offs of $767
million were partially offset by an allowance release.
Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released
$119 million of allowance in the first quarter, and the total allowance balance now stands at $11.3 billion. We
continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties. Our total
company coverage ratio is now 4%.
Turning to slide 5, I'll discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments. As you can see in the graph,
our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments. In our total card segment,
the allowance balance declined $65 million, driven by our international card businesses.
In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. With the slight decline in ending
loans, the flat allowance balance in Domestic Card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to 7.38%.
In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $16 million which, when coupled with loan
growth, resulted in a 10-basis point decline in coverage to 2.37%. And in Commercial, the $41 million decline in
allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement. The decline in coverage ratio was driven by both
the allowance release as well as growth.
Turning to page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during
the first quarter was 140%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory
requirement. The investment portfolio ended the quarter at $89 billion, declining by about $6 billion on a linked
quarter basis. Rising rates drove a market value decline of $4.3 billion, with the remaining decline due to our
continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic.
Turning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.49%, 50 basis
points higher than the year ago quarter and 11 basis points lower than Q4. Relative to a year ago, the increase in

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we deployed excess cash to loans. The linked quarter decrease
in NIM was driven by having two fewer days in the first quarter.
Normalizing for day count effect, higher yields in both our card business and in our investment portfolio were
roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields. Outside of quarterly day count,
the NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, interest rates and the
impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas.
Turning to slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%
at the end of the first quarter, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more
than offset by share repurchases, the impact of the CECL transition and higher risk-weighted assets. Recall that
the phase-in of CECL transition relief began on January 1. We recognized 25% of our $2.4 billion total after tax
phase-in amount in the first quarter.
Also in the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock as part of the $5 billion share authorization that
our board approved in January. Earlier this month, in addition to approving our CCAR 2022 submission and our
capital plan, our board of directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional $5 billion of common
stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year. We continue to estimate that
our CET1 capital need is around 11%.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-
year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue
compared the first quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card
results and trends, which are shown on slide 11.
Our Domestic Card business posted strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric in the first quarter as
we continued our long-standing strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across
the business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 26% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the first
quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $16.9 billion or about 19%
year-over-year. Ending loans were down just 1% from the sequential quarter, better than the typical seasonal
decline of around 7%. And revenue was up 20% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume and
loans as well as strong revenue margin.
Domestic Card revenue margin for the first quarter was 18.3%. Revenue margin continued to benefit from spend
velocity which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth. Spend velocity is driven
by the traction we're getting with heavy spenders. The margin also includes a gain from a card partnership
portfolio sale in the quarter.
Credit results remain strikingly strong. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.12%, a 42 basis
point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.32%, 8 basis points above
the prior year. Gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off
rate was up 63 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 10 basis points.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Non-interest expense was up 33% from the first quarter of 2021 driven by an increase in marketing. Total
company marketing expense was $918 million in the quarter. Our choices in domestic card marketing are the
biggest, but of course, not the only driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see opportunities to
book domestic card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns, and we continue to lean
into marketing to drive growth and build our domestic card franchise.
Consumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong. And in our own portfolio, credit results continue to be
well below pre-pandemic levels and are normalizing gradually. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions
and potential marketplace risks. And as always, we're underwriting to worsening scenarios even as we lean into
marketing. Our domestic card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decade-long focus on heavy spenders
continues to gain traction.
We increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of Venture X.
Growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses which show up
in our marketing expense. And part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise
with investments in our new travel portal and airport lounges.
And looking across the whole company, our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like
Capital One Shopping in our card business and Auto Navigator in our auto business. And modern technology
infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digital-first national direct banking strategy in Consumer Banking.
We're marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses.
Our marketing is paying off across these opportunities. We posted very strong growth in Domestic Card purchase
volume, new accounts and loans. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders.
And away from the card business, we're growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with Auto
Navigator, and our national direct banking business is winning with customers and driving growth.
Speaking of our auto and retail banking businesses, let's move to slide 12 which shows that strong loan growth in
our Consumer Banking business continued in the first quarter. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased
14% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 14%.
First quarter auto originations were up 33% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were up
20%. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our
auto business. We continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace.
First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits
were also up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 2% from the prior year quarter driven by
growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to
completely eliminate overdraft fees.
The year-over-year decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on
booking higher quality loans within credit segments. Across the auto lending industry, the pace of price increases
has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates. The decline in loan yields coupled with the pace of pricing
changes has compressed margins in our auto business.
First quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $126 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a net
expense of $130 million. The allowance for credit losses in our auto business was flat in the quarter compared to
an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate are gradually

normalizing and remains strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the first quarter was
0.66%, up 19 basis points year-over-year.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 73 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the
charge-off rate was up 8 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 47 basis points.
Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business which delivered strong growth in loans,
deposits and revenue in the quarter. First quarter ending loan balances were up 17% year-over-year driven by
growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization. Average loans were up 15%.
Ending deposits grew 9% from the first year – from the first quarter of 2021 as middle market and government
customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits increased 12% year-over-
year. First quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 16%.
Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-
off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.7% and the criticized non-performing loan
rate was 0.8%.
In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first
quarter. We also posted strong auto and commercial growth. Credit is gradually normalizing and remains
strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders.
Pulling way up, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. Our modern
technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity, and it's the engine of enduring value
creation over the long-term.
And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. So obviously, the investor sentiment has turned quite cautious on the consumer but it seems like, Rich,
you think credits doing – I mean, clearly, credit is doing quite well in your loan book, and you guys are leaning into
growth. Maybe you could just give us some perspective on some of the macro headwinds that the consumer is
facing and sort of how you see it progressing through the portfolio as the year progresses. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Hey, Sanjay. Yes, so let's just talk about the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer continues to
be strong. While the savings rate has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels, the cumulative impact of savings over
the last two years is still a significant positive. We see this in higher bank account balances and higher household
net worth, and it is true across the income spectrum.
Now of course, the bulk of government stimulus is now behind us, and most industry forbearance programs are
winding down. But I think we'll see some sustained benefits from consumer deleveraging through the pandemic.
Debt servicing burdens are lower than they've been in decades supported both by deleveraging and by low
interest rates.
On the other side of the consumer balance sheet, labor market demand remains strong. So in our own portfolio,
Sanjay, we see continuing strength in roll rates, cure rates and recovery rates. And even as we see signs of
normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any historical standard. There are emerging
headwinds as well, for example, high price inflation. Inflation has the potential to erode the excess savings
consumers accumulated through the pandemic especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth
and also higher interest rates would push debt servicing burdens back up.
But if we pull off on the whole, I'd say consumers are in good shape coming out of the pandemic relative to most
historical benchmarks. In fact, I've just learned over the years that I've got a lot of confidence in how – what
consumers learn from downturns and scares that they have and the choices that they make, and I think we're just
seeing very rational behavior by consumers. I worry more about markets and how competitors operate and
lending practices and things like that. We can save that for another question. But we still feel good about the
consumer. And look, it is a natural thing. It would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is. And so
normalization, the root word in normalization is normal.
And there's quite a journey to really sort of an equilibrium place for credit performance. And one of the reasons
that we're still leaning pretty hard into our growth opportunities is our confidence in the consumer and our read of
the marketplace at this time.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Okay. Great. And a follow-up question on some of the regulatory scrutiny we're seeing. There's been some
chatter on card loan fees and overdraft fees, the latter of which I think you guys have gotten in front of. Maybe you
could just talk a little bit about the card loan fee, the card fees chatter out there from some of the regulators and
how it might affect your business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, Sanjay, we, as a company, have been very focused on minimizing fees just in general for our
consumers. Obviously, the overdraft announcement was a pretty dramatic case in point there. But even in the
card business, when you look, really, what Capital One has is an APR and a late fee and, in some cases, a cash
advance fee. Both of those fees are really to discourage certain behaviors that we don't think are in the interest of
the consumer.
So, yes, so our strategy has been to have pricing be upfront and have it be clear and very simple. Now late fees
are something that we have continued to have late fees because we wouldn't want our loved ones ending up
paying late on their bills. So just late fee, I think, is one of the natural fees that probably make sense to have on a
product. The Fed has created a safe harbor with respect to late fees. Maybe the industry will – that will be
revisited. And obviously, we will watch that as we continue our business.

Richard Shane Q

Thanks for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit more about the partnership portfolio sale, how to think
about that from an asset perspective and the impact on the P&L in terms of revenue and any associated decline
in expenses associated with that sale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah, Rick, it's Andrew. I mean we disclosed the overall gains between the two portfolios of $192 million. The two
portfolios combined, you saw probably last year, when they got marked held for sale, were roughly $4 billion. But
below the surface there, we're not going to get into specifically the run rate of revenue or the expenses associated
with that in part because we're growing the rest of the portfolio, and you're going to see partnership businesses
come in and out over time.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon. Rich and Andrew, you have unique insight into consumers at both ends of the credit
spectrum. Could you parse out for us in a little bit more detail just following up on Sanjay's question specifically at
what kinds of credit normalization trends you're seeing at both the high end and the low end of the credit
spectrum, if you could sort of juxtapose those for us and maybe call out any differences? And then perhaps any
possibility that inflationary pressures could lead to a bit faster normalization at any – at the lower end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Bill. So we have, for quite a long time, saying we should all expect normalization. In terms of what we
see in normalization, it's pretty early and pretty modest. In fact, if anything, I guess, we would – we're sort of
struck by how moderate the pace is, but we shouldn't necessarily count on that but it is certainly striking so far.
What we are seeing in normalization is really across the credit spectrum and across the income spectrum. It does
seem that normalization is a bit more pronounced at the lower end of the market, if you sort of measured either in
terms of income or credit score. But those are also populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the
pandemic. So that's – so I think we're seeing – and we would expect this is – and across the board's kind of return
toward normal over time.
With respect to inflation, we worry a lot about inflation and that is something that especially if inflation as we've
seen and what it costs to live is faster than wage inflation, these can put pressures and sometimes can put
pressures more on the – in the more Mainstreet America. And so it's something that we worry quite a bit about.
And I think that it would be very natural for these inflation pressures to put more pressure on consumers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you, Richard. It's really helpful. If I may ask a related follow-up, maybe could you discuss the extent to
which positive credit migration fueled by pandemic stimulus that perhaps may have led you to increased line sizes
and then now to the extent to which we could sort of see a reversal in that. And perhaps as credit normalizes,
would you expect negative credit migration to ultimately lead to a reversal of those line sizes or is that not how it
worked?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Over the years, we have worked hard to originate accounts, and we've said it's kind of a coiled spring of
growth opportunity, and we uncoiled the spring gradually based on customer performance and also the
marketplace. And so we have, as part of the growth that you see, while it's being powered by very strong
originations and some return to spending and card usage by the back book, we also have been selectively
increasing credit lines.
Nothing dramatic but it's consistent with my earlier comments about the consumer and, again, with great
demonstration by the performance of our customers, we have been selectively increasing credit lines. And I think I
don't see anything that would change our lean in that direction. Again, it's selective. And it assumes a worsening
9

environment. It assumes normalization, all of those things. So I don't think we'd be set up to be surprised there.
And I don't see – I don't have any conversations about trying to reverse that direction.

Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good evening. On the – regarding the credit, on the reserve front, I know you had released an incremental $190
million, and you indicated that you do have additional qualitative reserves aside. I know your reserve ratio right
now is near your day one CECL level. How should we think about the potential for incremental reserve releases
from here? Do you think that we stabilize at this level of the reserve ratio? Or do you think there's incremental
room to release?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Well, John, when you quote the – this is Andrew, by the way. When you quote the reserve level, keep in mind that
they're pretty significantly different reserve levels by asset class. And so the total company level, of course, is
influenced by that mix. So I would suggest we decompose it a bit by each of them because auto was a little bit
below where it was on CECL day one. And that's largely a function of the elevated used car prices, our mix in
prime. So we're seeing loss rates that are much below, I think, 66 basis points was the number this quarter. And
so all else equal, you would expect that our coverage ratio there would be well below what it was at adoption, and
yet it's only a little bit below, and that's for the qualitative factors there.
But the largest factor to the total company reserve will clearly be card. And that's one where, I think, it's always
helpful to just start with a reminder of how that allowance is constructed because answering your question is
really dependent on a number of assumptions where, quite frankly, your guess could be as good as mine.
And so with card, the first thing that goes into the allowance is just the expectation of future losses and
recoveries. And you can see what's in our delinquency buckets in the near term. But beyond that, we assume that
there's a relatively swift normalization of losses from those unusually strong levels, historically strong.
The second is the size of the balance sheet which you saw this quarter is growing at a quite healthy pace when
you normalize quarter-over-quarter for seasonal effects and certainly up 19%, I think, the number is in Q1 for card
relative to a year ago. And then the third input is that level of qualitative factors. And that's really just to account
for a variety of risks related to inflation and various things that are impacting that and just uncertainty in the more
macro economy.
And so the future allowance is really going to be determined by how all of those effects net out. The one thing that
I will just remind you is what we call the quarter swap effect. And that is, as credit begins to normalize, we will be
replacing a currently low loss quarter with a slightly higher loss quarter. So that's another thing that will create
pressure all else equal.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
But if favorable credit trends continue and the factors driving those qualitative reserves subside, we could see the
allowance be down to flat. But if normalization plays out and we're growing at a significant clip, I wouldn't
anticipate that we'll see allowances release. In fact, I could see allowance builds. So it's really just a function of all
of those factors. Sorry for the long-winded technical answer there, but I just think all of those factors are really
important for you to understand because the range of outcome on the allowances is quite large.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay, Andrew. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just around consumer spend behavior and
volumes. On behavior, are you seeing any shifts in spending on discretionary shifting towards non-discretionary?
And then secondly, are you – on the volume side, do you forecast a slowdown in card spend volume overall as
the Fed hikes and aims at slowing the economy? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. I have not looked recently at discretionary versus non-discretionary, so I don't want to speculate on
that. I will tell you a thing that is certainly striking is what's happening with T&E spend these days. Just by way of
comparison, T&E spend was up 90% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, that was a very depressed
quarter but up around 20% from first quarter 2019 levels.
So there's a lot of – I think with people sort of just bursting out and wanting to free themselves from some of what
they've been through in the pandemic, we certainly see strength there. But I think your question about – as really
inflation hits, and we see just a lot of downstream effects that can happen from that, that certainly could impact
card spend.
But I would say a lot of the traction that we have in card spend is coming from our really spender-focused
business and, frankly, heavy-spender-focused business. And I think that – I'm not sure that a change in inflation is
going to have necessarily that much impact on the propensity of the heavy spenders will spend.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Rich, Andrew. So maybe just to start off, Rich, you referenced the competitive landscape out there in card
and auto a few times. I think you said larger upfront bonuses and you're closely watching some of the competitive
dynamics. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing out there? And I think, historically, it's been unusual
for you to be growing this fast when the rest of the market is also growing. So I'm just wondering, can you maybe
just talk about on the card side what are you seeing banks versus non-banks and anything you're seeing on the
auto side would be helpful at this point.

Okay, Ryan. I do have to smile at your comment because often we have zagged – well, zigged while others
zagged. And we – you and I, in fact, have chatted about that and the reasons sometimes behind it because – and
it's not just an accident that that sometimes has been our pattern because part of what we're reading is the
competitive marketplace, and that has impact on the opportunity and on credit performance and selection
dynamics and a lot of things.
So your question is a great one. But I think a lot of companies out there see the strength of the consumer. They
are sort of feeling the consumer sort of roaring back with respect to more normal activities. And I think people are
leaning in to take advantage of that. And certainly we are.
But we – let me talk a little bit just about the competition in the card business. We certainly know that there's
elevated marketing. All the companies are pretty much coming out and showing more marketing, talking about
more marketing. So that is happening, and we have a careful eye to see what that does to the opportunity that
we're experiencing. But I'll kind of come back to our opportunity there. But certainly, marketing levels are
elevated.
Competition in the rewards space is probably a notch more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but it's pretty stable
in recent quarters and not what I would call irrational. Certainly, there are incredibly good players at the top of the
market and there's a lot of competition there, but that hasn't really altered our view of the opportunity either. APRs
have generally been stable.
Turning to the fintechs for a second. Obviously, we've seen a lot of buy now, pay later activity. I think that we
should note that the fintechs who are in the lending business have been lending in the greatest rearview mirror of
credit – industry credit performance that you could ever imagine. And businesses like installment lending-based
businesses sometimes are pretty sensitive in that environment. So I – but we continue to see quite a bit of activity
on fintechs as well.
But on the card side, before I turn to auto, we have an eye on the competition. I think generally, though, the
competition, while intense, is not unreasonable. We have not seen the big changes in people's underwriting
policy, the kind of things that we haven't seen dramatic changes in pricing. So I think it's more I would label it at
the intense level that we would expect at a time like this but not unreasonable and not something that would
cause us to move off our pretty strong lean into the growth opportunity.
So in the auto business, let me just talk a little bit about this. The competition in the auto business continues to
remain intense. It's showing up across the board from credit unions, big banks and small independent lenders,
12

and it's playing out across all credit segments. And you just kind of double-click into that for a second, credit
unions that have been awashed with deposits, they've been gaining significant share consistent with what we've
observed during prior cycles and especially as interest rates go up a little bit.
And let's talk, in fact, about rising interest rates. I think it's almost always the case in business that when, in a
sense, the cost of goods sold rises, there typically is a lag in how that makes its way into consumer pricing. What
we've – as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we have not seen the marketplace – the auto marketplace yet
respond in terms of pricing relative to what's actually happening to interest rates.
So there is some compression there. I think typically what we've seen in the past is competitors respond with
differing speeds to interest rate increases. So sometimes, players like credit unions tend to – and maybe they
have different FTP methodologies or whatever tend to be sort of the slowest to respond. But we – so we'll have to
keep an eye on that. But I think that we are really excited about our opportunity in the auto business. The
technology products that we have out there are really cutting edge and getting a huge amount of traction. Our AI
is just very careful on the pricing out there and also just whether there is an over-exuberance relative to the
number of planets that aligned in the auto lending business, particularly what sort of happened to used car values.
And in effect, that's still there. Just keep an eye on whether that industry can remain as rational as it's been in the
last couple of years.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe as a quick follow-up, sticking with things that are unusual. Andrew, you guys are continuing to
aggressively return capital. I think you have two different $5 billion [ph] assets (45:18) out there which, again, is
unusual for you guys. I was wondering can you maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of the utilization of
those? And how do you think about use of capital as you're getting closer to the 11% CET1 target? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Recall that in January, we did not have an active program at the time. So our board authorized $5 billion,
and capital levels were even higher than they are today at that point. And so earlier this month, in conjunction with
the approval of the capital plan and our CCAR submission, they authorized an additional $5 billion which
coincides with the capital plan and therefore would be available at the start of the third quarter. But in terms of the
pace of that activity, it feels a little bit different than it did when we were at 14.5% over a year ago.
To your point, like asymptotically, we're sort of heading towards 11%. And so the pace of repurchases is as
always going to be dependent on our primary use of capital for loan growth and then the dividends. But beyond
that, we're going to keep a really close eye on just the level of capital and earnings and growth and market
dynamics and take advantage of the fact that we're able to operate under the SCB framework and maintain that
flexibility. So nothing specific in terms of the time line there but just wanted to be clear about the approvals when
we announced it a few weeks ago.

Hi. Good evening.

Hey, Betsy.

Hey. Good evening, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess just switching gears a little bit. I wanted to ask a little bit about what you're seeing with regard to payment
rates. And is there any differentiation amongst the customer base as to how that's been trajecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So Betsy, we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base. And while lately it's been sort of
flattening out, if you will, I mean payment rates are just well above pre-pandemic levels. And while not a perfect
proxy, you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in March remained close to 50%.
One of the more recent drivers of higher payment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and
healthy consumer balance sheets. And we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize even though
it's kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect. And I certainly believe payment rates
will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit. So over time, the normalization of credit plausibly leads to
some normalization of higher payment of normal – of payment rate.
I think there's another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet behind our payment rate numbers, and that
is that each year, we're gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders. Also, you may remember, for years,
we talked about – gosh, this goes all the way back to the Great Recession, Capital One's systematic avoidance of
high-balance revolvers, which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times, but is a
move for the sake of resilience.
But I think the sort of systematic effects of avoiding high-balance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and
more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our
payment rate as well. But certainly probably the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are
being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the marketing piece, I know we spoke about it a little bit earlier in the call.

marketing kind of Q by Q by Q to a greater degree so we should build off of 1Q such that our marketing's higher

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
year-on-year, full year-full year? That's what I'm getting from the conversation earlier, but I just want to make sure
it's the right takeaway.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Well, yeah. Let me just – why don't I do this, Betsy. Let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and
then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had.
There are a few things driving our marketing levels higher these days. First of all, the opportunities that we see.
We're seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and we're leaning hard into them while the
opportunities are there. In our card business, we have continued to expand our products and the marketing
channels that we're originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology
transformation, which has enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning
models and enable customized solutions.
So we're seeing significant traction in originations across our business and I want to note that so much of our card
business overall and our growth is in our branded card franchise as opposed to co-brand and private label
partnerships. And by the way, we also like those businesses but for Capital One, that's a relatively smaller
proportion of our business.
And in branded card, we enjoy the full economics of the business, and we own the customer franchise. So while
the industry doesn't track data on this, I think our share growth in branded cards is particularly noteworthy. And
branded card is, of course, as the word implies, it's about our brand. And we continue to invest in the company's
brand and in the flagship products. And some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from
having so much branded card where we own all the economics. But the flip side of that is that the marketing and
the brand-building are entirely on us, and that all shows up in our marketing numbers. But that's an absolute
centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise.
Now, second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction we're getting in our more
than decade-long journey to drive more and more upmarket with a focus on heavy spenders. So we launched our
Venture card way back in 2010, and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders. But it hasn't
just been about flagship cards. It's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders
and that's about great products with heavy reward content. It's about great servicing. It's about customer
experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles and, of course, an exceptional digital experience.
So for years, we've been on this journey and every year, we've had growing traction. And while our whole
franchise of spenders has grown nicely, we've grown even faster with heavier spenders. And with each year of
success, we've had the license to stretch a little higher upmarket and we're continuing to invest to make that
possible.
And lately, you've seen our launch of our travel portal, which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace.
You've seen the launch of airport lounges, which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent
travelers. And last fall, we launched Venture X, which moved us into the next tier of premium cards. And that
launch has been very successful, and we continue to invest in the growth of that product.
You can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase
volume growth that we've had over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods. You'll
find Capital One posting really high in your top of the league tables, if not at the top of the league tables purchase
15


Capital One Financial Corp.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
volume growth. And also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our branded cards and that's why
you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin.
This journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional card business. It has
higher upfront costs of brand-building, higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions and, of course,
investment in high-end experiences. But long-term value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high
spend levels, strong margins, very low losses, low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our
franchise. So the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance,
and that's a continuing long-term benefit of these investments.
I just want to mention a third factor contributing to the higher marketing is some of the traction that we're getting
with our new digital offerings, including Auto Navigator, Capital One Shopping, and our national bank. And just to
comment on the national bank which, unlike Capital One, unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank
acquisitions, we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically which, of course, does take marketing
investment. So that was just taking a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing
that you're seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it.
Now, due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest, those
quests being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move upmarket, these things are
contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days. So that's sort of a – pulling up sort of a narrative on why
it is that we're leaning hard into marketing, and it's a combination of sort of the opportunity of the moment as well
as capitalizing on the journey that's been many years in the making.
Typically, we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year. An important contributor to our marketing was
things related to the – for example, the launch of Venture cards, early spend bonuses and things like that. So
things are not – it's not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years.
We're not specifically giving guidance on the rest of the year, but I just wanted to share with you why it is that
we're leaning into marketing, what's driving that. And I am – as you can probably tell from the answer, I'm really
enthused about our opportunities and we are, though, leaning in to take advantage of them. And a lot of that's
about marketing.

Great. Thanks. Rich, just wondering, what would it take to see both kind of – you talked about some of the
potential pressures, particularly for the lower end consumer in terms of inflation and other sorts of things. What
would it take to actually start to see you pull back both at the lower end consumer and for the higher spenders?
Like what sort of – what would be the warning signs?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Yeah. So Moshe, with respect to the lower end consumers, it's less about – let's imagine. We don't have to do
very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one where the consumer is in a
more challenged place where the competitors have gone a whole notch more aggressive. And what I think is
more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big
dial back, say, in origination machines. So we're just more cautious online, try to continue to build the franchise,
maybe not as aggressively as sometimes. But again, we have over our 30 years, Moshe, in building sort of the
Mainstreet franchise, really do a lot of the regulating of things on the line side.
On heavy spenders, we continued to find so much traction and what I've often said about the quest for heavy
spenders, unlike a lot of things that I've seen in our business journey, this is not a thing that is very well-suited to a
blitz here, a pullback, a blitz and a pull back. Now, that doesn't mean we wouldn't be dialing the knobs up and
down on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever, but this is – and I think there's a reason
that not very many players are really, really successful at the top of the market. This is about really building a
franchise at that end of the market that's not just taking regular consumer products and dressing them up with
more rewards or fancy advertising and that's why I mentioned this journey that we're like in the 12th year of the
journey where we declared we're going to just keep moving upmarket.
One can't do it overnight. It's something you have to earn along the way. But all of our metrics continue to show
traction and success, traction on brand metrics as well and pretty much all the customer metrics. You've seen
what's happening on purchase volumes. When we track the things that we have booked over the years, we sort of
love the annuities we're booking.
So that, to me, is something that we're going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time. But what we will – the
things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices, certain product choices, but that one, I
partly shared – want to share this a little bit more about this today that that's a journey that Capital One's been on
as part of our – central part of our strategy in card for a lot of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks, Rich. And maybe as a follow-up, could you talk a little bit about where you see the industry and
Capital One in terms the deposit price competition as we're now starting to see in deposit betas as we're now
starting to see interest rates moving up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Sure, Moshe. It's Andrew. And recognizing that retail deposits are 85% of our portfolio, I'll focus on that. And over
the last, gosh, six-ish years, we had the falling rate cycle over the last couple where betas were right around 50%.
And then the last rising cycle, which was from the late 2015, I think, to early 2019, our cumulative beta was right
around 40%. And so betas are generally slow to rise over the first couple of hikes.
But keep in mind that that last rising rate cycle, we had eight hikes over 3.5 years, I believe it was, whereas in this
cycle, we could see four hikes that each equal 25 basis points and get up to 250 or 275 as forward suggest quite
quickly. So I could make a case that industry betas will be higher or lower than that history.
On the lower side, there's elevated deposit balances across the industry. The loan-to-deposit ratios are quite low,
industry NIMs are low, and we're moving off a zero floor. But the flip side is the larger and quicker rate hikes, the
possibility of some more aggressive pricing by institutions that are more reliant on those funds or deposits to fund
loan growth and institutional surge deposit runoff.

So just want to give you a flavor of – I think there's a lot that we're going to learn over the course of the next few
months. But as we look at all and have a point estimate that kind of run through all of our assumptions, our point
estimate at this point is that it's going to largely be in line with that rising – the last rising cycle of something like 40
basis points that starts off a little slower and picks up. But again, this starts off slower might be a particularly
condensed timeframe relative to what we saw in that last cycle.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Quick question on the outlook for the adjusted efficiency ratio from Q1 levels. And then, Rich, on commercial card
issuing, can you talk about that business? And I noticed you've been marketing a no limit small business card,
which has been sort of tough for banks to roll out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay, Don. Thank you. Yeah, we've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years and the
pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and
certainly in banking. And I think, for every player, the clock is ticking on their tech readiness, and companies are
waking up to the investment imperative. And we've talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is
breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is the fiercest that I have seen in any time in my career and in any
job family.
So there's an urgency in responding to the marketplace but I do want to also say that the fast-moving marketplace
is also the creator of our opportunity. And I think Capital One's uniquely positioned to take advantage of that
opportunity, and that's why we're investing now. So really, this is very similar message to what I said last quarter,
what I've been saying for a long time. We're still very focused on the opportunity to drive operating efficiency
improvement over the longer term.
The engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains but the timing of efficiency improvement
needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. So – but delivering positive operating leverage
over time continues to be an incredibly important North Star to us and, frankly, one of the most important payoffs
of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver long-term value.
So I think you have sort of seen – you can see some of the effects of what I'm talking about in the first quarter
operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter. So I think it's very similar
conversation to what I was saying last time. We can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers,
but the current pressure doesn't change at all our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency
improvement.

My question was that, Rich, your outlook on commercial. I know as you roll out a no limit small business card
which has been tough for banks to do, I didn't know if maybe you're using the public cloud. Just want to see your
thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So when you're talking about, yeah, commercial, you're talking about here our business card business,
Credit Card. You may have seen the ads on TV that talk about no preset spending limit. That's it, that's it, more
complicated way to just say, in a sense, not a credit limit that gets hardwired. This is something that is –
dynamically, there isn't a credit line per se. This is dynamic transaction underwriting in real- time.
It's a very hard thing to build. It's taken us years to get there, and it's absolutely one of the many, many benefits of
the tech transformation we've done and the journey to the cloud and the building of modern applications and
modern platforms. And so I've always said to – investors will often ask, where can I see? What is the – I want to
reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money we've spent on that.
And I've said, look, there's not going to be any one thing that you point out and say, oh my gosh, that's – I now
see everything. This is about – this journey is a journey that when we – years ago, when we kind of said
someday, we'd like to do this thing over here. Someday, we'd like to do that. We'd also like to have much better
efficiency. We'd like to better risk management. We'd like to do lots of things and the striking thing was all the
things that we wanted to do, usually in life, they are – you have to pick some and it's all about trade-offs.
What I'm struck by in this journey is there's a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do. And
that path relates to building modern technology across the company from the bottom of the tech stack up, and
that is what we've done. And then over time, you, as investors, will see manifestations of that. You see, wow, that
Auto Navigator product Capital One built, that can underwrite every car in America for any consumer in a fraction
of a second. That's striking.
And then one sees, wow, so you actually have a no preset spending limit. That's striking and we didn't do the
journey for the sake of any one of those. But I think on an increasing basis, investors will see examples of things
that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment we've made in technology and things that also by
themselves, like this card thing we're talking about, is itself within that a journey that took a bunch of years. But it's
all about working backwards from wins with customers, and that's why we're doing that.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks very much, guys, for fitting in my question. Rich, you talked a lot about credit and the strength of your
customer base. Aside from that, we are seeing, call it, some of the more modern or emerging platforms. We're
observing some delinquency drift there and in fact, we're even seeing some reactions in the capital markets.
Some securitization deals are getting canceled or renegotiated as they go. I'm wondering, what do you ascribe
that to and are there any reverberating effects from that type of development or migration into your business over
time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So John, as I often say with a smile, Capital One was one of the original fintechs. We were a fintech before
fintechs were a word. But if you think about what we did is we built a lending company, started with cards, but
we're ultimately building a broad-based financial institution. One thing that enabled that journey to happen is the
advent of the capital markets, and we were able to ride the very meteoric growth of Capital One in the 1990s
based on securitizations and things.
And so we were very grateful for that. But at the same time, we then did probably one of the most things that I
think most shocked our investors. I guess it didn't shock them because we spent a lot of years talking about it
before we did it, but a striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet
because we wanted to create much greater resilience in our funding.
So the reason I mentioned that is as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization have
an opportunity to grow quickly, but they also have a – just an inherent structural challenge with resilience. So, for
all of them, they need to – and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that.
I want to talk just a little bit about – you mentioned some of the lending results and some of the uptick. So first of
all, we shouldn't be surprised to see upticks in delinquencies just for companies in general, whether they are
banks or some of the fintechs. Typically, companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are
probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror. I mean the example – let's just say that
you created a fintech in the last couple of years. How would one look in the rearview mirror and determine where
resilience is and where it isn't since in general pretty much everybody did well? So that's one of the challenge any
new company has is building a deep enough credit history to do that. So I'll say that's just a challenge they bring
to the table. It's not their fault. It's a structural thing.

The other thing that always happens with normalization is normalization tends to happen faster on front books
than back books. And so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is if they're high-growth fintechs, just the
proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different, and it would be
surprising if they didn't normalize faster given that typically front books normalize faster than back books. And a
lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them, and that's also very helpful in a
normalization journey.
So as one that was an original fintech, I have great fascination with the fintechs, a lot of respect for a lot of things
they're doing, but I also know that there are some structural things that they're going to have to confront that they
and their investors will have to keep an eye on.
