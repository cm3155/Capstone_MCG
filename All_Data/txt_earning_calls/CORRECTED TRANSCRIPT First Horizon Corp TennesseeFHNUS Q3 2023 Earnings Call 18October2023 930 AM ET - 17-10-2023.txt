MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Thank you all for joining. I would like to welcome you all to the First Horizon Corp. Third Quarter 2023
Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brica and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines are on mute in
the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator
Instructions]
I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Natalie Flanders, Head of Investor Relations, to begin.
So Natalie, you may begin when you are ready.

Natalie R. Flanders
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Brica. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 results conference call. Thank you for joining
us. Today, our Chairman, President, and CEO, Bryan Jordan; and Chief Financial Officer, Hope Dmuchowski, will
provide prepared remarks. And then we'll be happy to take your questions. We're also pleased to have our Chief
Credit Officer, Susan Springfield, here to assist with questions as well. Our remarks today will reference our
earnings presentation, which is available on our website at ir.firsthorizon.com.
As always, I need to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Therefore, we ask you to review the factors that may cause our results to differ from our
expectations on page 2 of our presentation and in our SEC filings. Additionally, please be aware that our
comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of notable items. These are non-GAAP
measures so it's important for you to review the GAAP information in our earnings release and on page 3 of our
presentation. And last but not least, our comments reflect our current views and you should understand that we
are not obligated to update them.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our third quarter results reflect the
quality of our franchise and we have highlighted some of our key strengths on slide 5. Over the past five months, I
have become increasingly confident in our ability to serve our customers and communities and deliver strong
shareholder returns. Our team of associates are highly experienced. We've retained 90% of our talent over the
past year who have been with us over nine years on average. We have an extraordinary client base that's been
with us a long time with a median tenure of 16 years. Our team's dedication to serving clients is the key driver of
our ability to retain 91% of our clients over this past year. With our experienced bankers' focus on excellent
customer service and our ability to deploy capital through loan and deposit growth, we're seeing solid momentum
in our businesses right now. I'm grateful for the hard work of our associates as they deliver value for our clients,
communities, and shareholders.
On slide 6 are some of the financial highlights from this quarter, which Hope will cover with you in more detail. We
delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27 per share on pre-tax pre-provision net revenue of $318 million, resulting in a
return on tangible common equity of 9.2%. Our results were impacted by an idiosyncratic charge-off of $72 million

that we communicated earlier this quarter. This credit loss was related to a company who unexpectedly converted
from a Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Otherwise, the balance sheet continues to perform very well.
Period end deposits are up $1.6 billion or 2.4% from the last quarter. As we continue to have success in acquiring
customers throughout our deposit franchise and campaigns. We opened over 19,000 new deposit accounts this
quarter, bringing in $1 billion in balances, with over a third of the balances going into checking products. Our loan-
to-deposit ratio improved to 92% as deposit growth outpaced loan growth of just under 1%. These are relatively
flat to the prior quarter as our countercyclical businesses have stabilized at cyclical lows. So we need to make
some investments over the next year or two. We have a proven track record of managing our expense base and
we'll be disciplined in our reinvestment strategy. Our capital position continued to be very strong, with our CET1
ratio flat to the prior quarter at 11.1%.
As we look toward 2024, we will be evaluating our options to [ph] repatriate (05:06) capital to our shareholders,
with an eye toward a longer-term CET1 ratio range of 9.5% to 10.5%. Overall, the sentiment of our bankers and
clients remains cautious but positive. Inflation and labor supply continue to be a challenge. However, the
economies in our footprint are performing well. Additionally, we recently released the results of our most recent
stress test, which demonstrated our capacity to maintain capital levels well in excess of regulatory minimums
even in the Fed's severely [indiscernible] (05:46).
In short, given our stable, diversified business mix, attractive footprint, and the strong credit culture, we feel
confident in our ability to profitably navigate any economic scenario. Our experienced team has a proven track
record of delivering high quality service to meet our clients' and communities' needs. This yields long-tenured,
deep relationships that enable us to produce top quartile returns over the cycle.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Hope to run through this quarter's financial results. Hope?

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 7. We provide adjusted financials and key
performance metrics for the quarter. We generated PPNR of $318 million, down modestly from second quarter.
The main driver was a $26 million decline in net interest income driven by higher deposit costs. Fees and
expenses are relatively stable to the prior quarter. As Bryan already mentioned, we experienced an idiosyncratic
credit loss of $72 million, which drove the [ph] $16 million (07:00) increase in provision expense to $110 million in
the quarter. This single credit impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.10. Other charge-offs of
$23 million were in line with the prior quarters. Tangible book value per share came in at $11.22, with adjusted
earnings per share of $0.27, partially offsetting the $0.41 impact of higher marks on securities and hedges and
$0.15 of dividend.
On slide 8, we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by $0.04 per quarter.
Third quarter notable items include a pre-tax restructuring expense of $10 million related to streamlining our
market structure, in addition to some reductions in force primarily within mortgage as we continue to look at
operational efficiencies within our businesses to offset increasing cost. In addition to the tax impact of the
restructuring, there are two notable tax items: a $24 million tax liability related to the book value surrender of
approximately $214 million of separate account BOLI. This was triggered by the Fitch downgrade of the US from
AAA to AA+, which caused non-compliance with the underlying investment guidelines of the [ph] RAP (08:31)
provider. Lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates made the surrender of the policy the most attractive
option to exit this low yielding asset and redeploy the cash into higher yielding and more liquid alternatives.
Partially offsetting this is an $11 million of tax benefits primarily related to amended returns on prior acquisitions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
On slide 9, I will walk through net interest income and margin. NII of $609 million and net interest margin of 3.17%
remained strong despite moderating from cyclical highs. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 81 basis points,
partially driven by a full quarter impact of the second quarter deposit campaign. Offsetting this increase was a
partial quarter benefit of the July rate hike on floating rate assets as we remain asset sensitive. In fourth quarter,
we will have the opportunity to reprice the promotional money market accounts acquired in second quarter, as
well as the full benefit of July's rate hike, giving us the ability to improve our NII and margin from third quarter's
level.
The cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta reached 63% this quarter. We expect this to be the high watermark
for us in this cycle. Our success in continuing to grow customer deposits enabled the payoff of all remaining FHLB
borrowings this quarter. Over time, margin will also benefit from the continued repricing of fixed rate cash flows
and widening credit spreads. As two thirds of our loan portfolio is floating rate, we remain well-positioned to
benefit in a rising rate environment.
As you can see on slide 10, we're still seeing strong inflows from our deposit campaign. Period end deposits were
up 2.4% from last quarter, demonstrating our ability to expand market share. As the Fed's H8 data shows, deposit
is essentially flat for the industry as a whole. Deposit growth was driven by new customer acquisition and
deepening existing relationships. We opened over 19,000 new-to-bank deposit accounts, bringing over $1 billion,
including approximately $400 million of checking account balances. The average rate on our new customer
deposits was 4.2%, down over 100 basis points from our second quarter promotional rate. Additionally, the
customer we brought in during last quarter's promotion increased their balances by approximately $200 million.
The full quarter impact of the successful deposit campaign and a higher Fed funds rate drove an increase in
interest-bearing deposit costs from 2.55% in Q2 to 3.36% in Q3.
With our strong liquidity position, our focus is on primacy. We are launching a promotional cash offer for checking
accounts that meet primacy benchmarks over time. For customers acquired in the second quarter, the rate
guarantees on money markets will come up for repricing in the back half of the fourth quarter. We will have the
opportunity to moderate funding costs as we focus on converting from [ph] promo to primacy (11:57).
On slide 11, you'll see that period end loans of $61.8 billion were up $483 million or 1% linked quarter. Loans to
mortgage companies declined $454 million due to seasonality and the impact on volumes from higher mortgage
rates. Loan growth was diversified across our markets and portfolios. C&I growth was diversified across multiple
industries, geographies, and lines of businesses. CRE growth was largely driven by fund-ups from existing loans,
primarily in multifamily, while commitments remained flat. We have focused our on balance sheet mortgage
production on the Medical Doctor program, with over 60% of new balances coming through that channel this
quarter. This has been an attractive vertical for us as we can deepen these relationships with wealth management
and other products. Our bankers are focused on expanding spreads and deepening relationships through
increased cross-sell of depository, treasury, and wealth management products. Spreads on new fundings have
increased almost 30 basis points since last quarter and approximately 60 basis points year-over-year.
I will cover fee income trends on slide 12. Fee income is stable at $173 million versus $175 million in the prior
quarter. However, excluding deferred compensation, fee income increased by $6 million. Other non-interest
income was up $8 million, including an increase of $5 million in FHLB dividends from higher borrowing levels last
quarter, and a $1 million increase in swap fees. Again, I'll reiterate, we have paid off all of our FHLB borrowings in
Q3 with the new-to-bank customer deposits. Our countercyclical fee businesses are stabilizing near the cyclical
lows. We saw a modest decrease of $2 million in fixed income with average daily revenues down due to the

challenging market conditions. Mortgage banking income was up $1 million as we slightly modified our pricing
strategy to drive volume into the secondary market.
Moving on to expenses on slide 13. Excluding deferred compensation, adjusted expenses are up $12 million. This
is largely driven by the $11 million of merger-related retention expenses moving into core results this quarter.
Personnel expenses declined 2% or $4 million, and there are a couple of different moving parts. First, deferred
compensation declined by $8 million, which is offset in the corresponding fee income line. Second, as I previously
mentioned, the geography change of the $11 million of merger-related retention expense moving into core results.
Lastly, we had an $8 million reduction in other variable compensation. Other expenses were up $7 million as the
prior quarter included the benefit of a few discrete non-recurring items, which included lower franchise and realty
taxes. With the challenging economic environment, expense discipline remains a focus, and we continue to look
for operational efficiencies within our business. This quarter, we restructured our regional banks by consolidating
into two fewer regions and moderated our mortgage business. Our efficiency ratio was at 59% in Q3.
I will cover asset quality in reserves on slide 14. Loan loss provision increased by $60 million from Q2 to $100
million in Q3. The increase was driven by a single C&I charge-off of $72 million. This loan was a shared national
credit where we were the lead bank. We initially anticipated a recovery through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy sale.
However, there was an unexpected conversion to Chapter 7 in August, at which point we charged off the full
amount of the loan. We did not have a specific reserve for this credit as we had an updated third party valuation
that supported our carrying value and we anticipated an imminent sale within the quarter. We are working with
outside counsel to identify, evaluate, and pursue potential recoveries. At this time, we have no estimate of the
timing or ultimate amount of recoveries, if any.
Total charge-offs were $95 million in Q3. Excluding the idiosyncratic loss, charge-offs would have been $23
million, in line with the prior quarter. ACL coverage ratio increased 1 basis point to 1.36%, reflecting loan growth
and continued caution around the macroeconomic outlook. The vacancy rate in our office CRE portfolio is 11%,
which compares favorably to the industry which is experiencing vacancy of 19% in the southeast. Like others, we
are seeing credit normalize from historically low loss levels during the pandemic. Though commercial credit can
be variable, we do not expect significant broad-based deterioration in our portfolios.
On slide 15, you can see that we continue to have exceptionally strong capital level. Our CET1 ratio of 11.1%
remained flat to the prior quarter even as we organically deployed capital to loan growth. Even after adjusting for
the marks on our security portfolio and loan book, our pro-forma CET1 ratio would be 8.6%. Tangible book value
per share was $11.22 in Q3, a slight decrease from the prior quarter due to a $0.41 reduction from higher [ph]
mark-to-market (18:18) impact that were partially offset by $0.29 of adjusted NIAC. Total capital also remain very
strong at 13.6%.
On slide 16, we have made a couple of tweaks to our outlook, though we continue to believe that PPNR will be
within the guidance we gave at Investor Day in June. We updated our loan growth expectations from 3% to 5% to
7% to 9% as our success in raising deposits has enabled us to organically deploy excess capital into meeting our
clients' borrowing needs and strategically acquiring new clients. The net charge-off outlook is updated to include
this quarter's idiosyncratic loss, but we expect other charge-offs to be within prior guidance. The new capital
range [ph] RWA (19:14) impact of the updated loan guidance. This assumes no share buybacks, but as Bryan
mentioned, we intend to evaluate capital deployment as we head into 2024.
To wrap up on slide 17, I am very proud of how this team navigated 2023 so far with passion and commitment to
our clients despite the macroeconomic environment and the unique challenges we have faced. Our success in
client retention and acquisition would not be possible without the consistent focus of our associates that they have

on serving our clients through any cycle or challenge. We are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of
our diversified business model, highly attractive franchise, and asset sensitive balance sheet. We are making
strategic investments to support clients with products, services, and technology upgrades that will result in
improved efficiency. We will continue to look for operational efficiencies to offset our investments. We remain
committed to delivering attractive returns for shareholders through the cycle.
Now, I will hand it back to Bryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. I will roughly reiterate something Hope said a moment ago. Over the course of our history, we
have demonstrated our ability to execute and change in sometimes unusual economic environments. We know
how to pull the necessary levers in order to operate profitable. Our footprint and our teams give me tremendous
confidence in our ability to generate strong return to our shareholders. While 2024 economic conditions are likely
to soften somewhat, I expect that we will grow revenue, control expenses, and record positive operating leverage
next year. I am confident that this company has the people, the resources, and the determination to do what's
necessary to support our communities and shareholders throughout the economic cycle.
Brica, we can now open up the call for questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess maybe first question, just – thanks for running through kind of the promotion rates, where
they were this quarter versus last. As we think about the NII guide I guess full year or looking back into 4Q, 6% to
9%, give us a sense of how fourth quarter shakes out, the higher end versus lower end of that guidance range?
And then as we think about moving forward, you still have promotional [ph] CDs (22:25) or promotional deposits
rolling off. Just if this – should this be the [ph] trough (22:30) in NII and that growth continues through at least the
first half of 2024? Is that the right way to think about it? And again, the 6% to 9%, could it – what makes it 9%
versus 6%?

Thank you, Ebrahim, for many questions in one. I'll try to get all of them covered. Apologies if I miss one. You can
hold me accountable. First, we have not updated our ranges to a very specific percentage, but we expect next
quarter to look similar to current quarter trends with the exception of NII that we do expect to increase. And non-
interest margin, net interest margin that we do expect to increase next quarter as we're able to take advantage of
the expanding yields and lower deposit costs. Our Investor Day guidance that we reiterate here, we believe we'll
end up on a PPNR basis right in the middle of that, with revenue being a little bit towards the lower side as well as
expenses coming in on the lower side. On how we think about – sorry, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
No, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
As to how we think about going into next quarter and next year, as we said in our prepared remarks, we continue
to be focused on disciplined lending and bringing down our core deposit rates that we did. As we've talked about
multiple times in Q2, we went out with a very large promotion in order to reenergize our franchise, our bankers
and our clients, and we plan to walk those rates back. And I believe that the [ph] $1 billion mix (24:01) that we
were able to bring in in the quarter at [indiscernible] (24:03) shows that we're able to acquire new clients and walk
back existing client rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for that. And just a separate question. So I completely get this. The credit that you had this quarter
was very decent credit. But Bryan, you've done a ton of heavy lifting post-GFC in cleaning up this balance sheet.
And as you went through this credit, does this – did that cause you to revisit the loan book, to look at some of the
larger credits, kind of do another deep dive on the portfolio review to make sure there are no other kind of big
chunky surprises? Just talk to us about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ebrahim, this is Susan Springfield. I'll take that and then Hope and Bryan can add any comments. During really
any economic downturn, we take an opportunity to do portfolio reviews across sectors as well as markets. So we
are doing that for all of our lines of business, especially in lines as well as regional banks. The other thing is, any
time, we have any kind of loss, we do a – I call it a [ph] spilled milk (25:10) analysis to look at were there things
that we could have done differently whether that was the original underwriting, servicing, timing, communication,
et cetera. So we obviously do take that very seriously and are in the process of evaluating anything that could be
improved related to the outcome of that credit.
With that being said, I do feel that both Bryan and Hope indicated very good about the portfolio. We have a history
of strong client selection, being consistent and conservative in our underwriting, and staying on top of our
servicing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I would add to Susan's comments that as the economy has started to tighten and financial conditions have slowed
down to some extent, our interest cost is going to have impact. And so when you see those things happen, as

soon as that, we not only continue what we typically do in terms of credit monitoring, we do some focused
reviews. And we expect that credit will soften some, but we think we start in an extraordinarily good place with
strong borrower selection, strong underwriting and credit structure, and ultimately, strong collateral values. So we
have, as Susan said, an effort that we undertook to understand what happened with this one individual
idiosyncratic credit, and we will learn from that. But we believe the fundamentals of our credit selection,
underwriting, and delivery process will position us very well for our economy that's likely to soften some over the
course of the next year or so.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on expenses. So if I'm looking at the guide, I mean,
year-to-date, they're up 3% versus last year, and you guys are still talking – holding to that [ph] 6% to 8% (27:37),
which would imply a pretty big step-up in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate or is that guide conservative? And
then yeah, I'll start there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Casey, thank you for the question. I would say, reiterating my response to Ebrahim, on expenses, we're probably
going to be on the low side. We are trying to deploy a lot of new projects and technology that have not yet come
into our run rate. Some of those will start in Q4. And then the bigger unknown is really where our cyclical business
is [ph] half Q4 (28:10). They have such a variable revenue base. And so even though we're at 3%, we have set at
pretty low levels for FHN and we are expecting a little bit of an uptick in Q4 that would drive that expense up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. It feels like you would have to come in below that unless – anyway. Okay. And then Bryan, just following up
on your comments about positive operating leverage next year, I believe at your Investor Day, you were talking
about, yeah, expenses being up another [ph] 68% (28:40) next year. Is that your hope for positive operating
leverage in 2024? Does that still contemplate that 68% expense guide or is there a possibility to flex that lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I do think expenses will be up somewhat next year. Part of it is what Hope just talked about in terms of the
reinvestment in the franchise and making some investments in technology and then really doing some of the
remedial work that we have talked about in the past. With that said, I do still believe that we can drive positive
operating leverage. I'm very optimistic in our ability to continue to drive loan growth and particularly wider spreads

on our lending portfolios. And as Hope mentioned, the couple of different times and ways. We think we have the
ability to bring the cost of deposits down over the course of the next year. So all of that said, I think expenses can
be up. We're not going to spend a dollar that we don't need to spend. And so we're going to control expenses. At
the end of the day, though, I think we can still generate with even slightly higher expenses positive operating
leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And just lastly, on the capital return, you guys obviously warming up to the buyback is what it
sounds like to me. Just wondering, what is – you guys have been fairly consistent on this front and saying like it's
just not the time macro-wise, just given all the uncertainty. It's not as if that uncertainty is going to improve into
2024. I'm just wondering what is driving that decision to more increased appetite for a share buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think it's fair to sort of break it into two pieces. One, we said longer term in the prepared comments. It
would probably be in that 9.5% to 10.5% range. And I think that's probably a fair way to think about our business
through varying economic cycles as we sit here today. We're a little north of 11%. And I think as we look at 2024,
we may not bring it down much below 11% or into that range, but we don't believe that we need to let that capital
continue to accumulate. So depending on what happens with the balance sheet in terms of any growth, we think
there's still excess capital to repatriate to shareholders and hold those ratios in this current 11%, 11.1% area that
they're in today. So we think we can do both, maintain strong capital levels which are important in an economic
situation that's probably less certain than any of us might like, and at the same time, we don't need to let that
capital base continue to grow from here in our view.

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on the last two, on Ebrahim's and Casey's
questions. I guess what I'm trying to – what I'm struggling with here is the ability to actually drive positive
operating leverage, especially if countercyclical businesses specifically in mortgage and fixed income are going to
be under pressure. And it does look like – well, or fixed income will be under continued pressure under a higher
for longer scenario. So hope, maybe if you can just help us kind of understand the drivers of how you actually
drive positive operating leverage? Because I think that's something that we're all struggling with. I'm certainly
getting some emails. Thanks.

Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Michael, good to hear from you. And I appreciate the third question and I'll try to answer it as well as I can with a
little bit more detail. I think Casey said it that it's going to be hard for us to hit the [ph] 6% to 8% (32:54) expenses.
Bryan followed up with we are looking for ways to drive down expenses. We're only 4.5 months post the deal
termination and we're relooking at our franchise and trying to figure out how we make investments and how we
offset that. This quarter, we reorganized two of our regions. We downsized our mortgage business. We are
continuing to look at how can we bring back deposit cost. So we're going to be able to increase margin in future
quarters. We believe that this is our high watermark for the cost side of margin. We're going to see – we do
expect that our – on business will have a better year in 2024 than 2023 as we see stabilization in rates next year.
And we are going to continue to keep a disciplined focus on expenses. We're just in the cycle now as looking at
what 2024 will be from a budget perspective, and we're looking at every opportunity to bring down expenses and
drive revenue.
I would love to give you 2024 guidance. We just need a little bit more time to finalize everything. But I think you
should see the regional bank restructure that we did as well as the mortgage of us getting out pretty quickly the
first full quarter after a deal was terminated and looking at how we can run our businesses more efficiently and
redeploy that to investment to improve the client experience.

Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
When we look at the retention expenses coming back to core, I know we mentioned this on a prior quarter and it
came off at Barclays as well, the year-over-year increase in that is only $5 million. So even though we only have a
half year this year in core and a full year next year, because the first portion pays out at May, it is not as big of a
year-over-year increase as I think some of you have in your model. I think you guys were taking the $11 million
and assuming that was almost double next year. As we look at the expense that I see in your models, I think you
guys were overweighting that piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, helpful. And then, again, I know it's too hard for 2024 at this point, but I mean, is there an expectation just
broadly that you can actually grow NII? I certainly understand all the tailwinds as it relates to the margin. But is
that actually baked into at least preliminary expectations?

Hey. Hey, good morning, everyone.

Good morning, Brody.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hope, sorry to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to put a finer point on the expenses. To get to the low end of
your guidance range, I need to step expenses up to $520 million for the fourth quarter. So $55 million linked
quarter increase, which seems steep if not kind of like numerically impossible to kind of flex the model that high.
So can you tell me why, like specifically, what is going to drive the $55 million increase to get to the low end of the
guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think the low end of the guidance, 5.6% will also round up to 6%, right? Or 5.51%. And so as we look at it,
we're sitting here at about 4% and we're still haven't seen a lot of our technology projects start. And again, we
have a variable compensation model. FHN, we're sitting at a quarter that was a kind of a low watermark for them
and we are expecting increased revenue there, which calls for an increased compensation. We also have
additional marketing campaigns tied to our new checking account program that we just launched as well as
acquiring new deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q

And is there anything left from the deferred compensation from the TD deal that still needs to work its way into the
run rate? And if so, can you tell me what the dollar amount is there?

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
That's in the fourth quarter. It's in the same – basically the same ZIP code that you had in the third quarter, about
$11 million incremental in the third quarter expense base. And it should be about the same in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. Do you guys [ph] happen to have (37:32) with the spot interest-bearing deposit rate was
at [ph] 9.30 (37:36). And then you've talked about kind of moderating deposit costs from here. Do you have a view
on where you expect that spot rate to move to by [ph] 12.31 (37:45)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We do have the current spot rates at [ph] 3.39 (37:49) and we are looking to walk that down. I don't want to put a
rate out there. Every time I put a beta out there, a rate out there, we seem to miss it. So far, we've missed our
beta guidance and our rate guidance so we've been able to raise deposits quicker. We do have almost $6 billion
repricing in Q4 related to the money we brought on in Q2 with the deposit campaign. And so I think it really ties to
how quickly – what our ability is to walk that back as well as bring new deposits in. If we can continue to bring
them in at a [ph] $420 million (38:18) average rate, we'll be able to walk it back a lot more. But most of that
reprices in the second half of November and December. So we really got to see what our ability is, but we're
seeing some steep competition on deposit pricing. And so how that changes – how our competitors change their
deposit pricing from now until November and December when ours reprice will really kind of generate how much I
think we can walk it back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The other big factor to Hope's comment is the shift in mix is running those from non-interest-bearing to interest-
bearing, that naturally moves that cost up as well. So it's – there are a lot of levers to play. We think in the
aggregate is, as Hope highlighted in our prepared comments, the new money that we brought in in the third
quarter was on a mix basis significantly lower than it was in the second quarter in terms of the blended cost. And
we think it's just the deposit promo we've started to reprice. We have the opportunity to bring those cost down
more in line with where we've been bringing in new balances on over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And maybe switching gears for the – in the loan portfolio, do you happen to have what your exposure is to
shared national credits? And of that, what portion are you the lead lender on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Natalie R. Flanders A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, so we've got that information. In terms of shared national credits as a percent of the portfolio, it represents
about less than 14% of our balances. And we are the lead on about around 3%, 3% to 3.5% of that.

Okay. Great. And thank you very much, Natalie. And then the last one for me before I hop was just a two-parter
on the office exposure, specifically on the non-medical office. Do you happen to have what the allowances that
you have set aside against the non-medical office currently? And then do you have a sense for what the average
LTV on those properties are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Natalie R. Flanders A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So we don't – I don't have it broken out in that detail in terms of the allowance, but in terms of our loan-to-values
on office, you're talking about non-medical office, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, that's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Natalie R. Flanders A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Just the traditional office. So our portfolio today on traditional office stuff, the average upfront equity we have is
about 35%. And on a stabilized loan-to-value basis, we're at about 60%.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
We've had two big quarters of deposit growth, which has been good to see. It's helped lower your loan-to-deposit
ratio. How should we think about that going forward in 4Q and as we head into next year? Are you still targeting to
have deposit growth outpace loan growth? And is there a target you have in mind as far as where you want to get
your loan-to-deposit ratio?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, it's an interesting discussion. Hope and I talked about the loan-to-deposit ratio. We clearly want to grow
deposits. And I would say it's less about the balances than it is the relationship. It's customer acquisition to us,
and we want to be in a position to continue to broaden and deepen and grow customer relationships. Our loan-to-
deposit ratio ended the quarter at about 0.92. And if you blend that, that's probably a little bit higher than peers.
But if you throw on securities, which we tend to have a relative – much smaller relative portfolio, we're sort of right
in line. We think to the extent that we can grow relationships and we can grow deposits, it gives us the fuel to
continue to support customer needs on the credit side as well. And so we are not proactively as much managing
the loan-to-deposit ratio as we are trying to proactively manage our ability to serve our customers and our
communities in a profitable fashion. So I'd say at the end of the day, if we have the opportunity to grow attractively
priced deposits and relationships, absolutely, we're going to continue to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, what I will add to that is we are – we feel like we're in a great place because we have now two quarters of
deposit growth. We've shown that we can do it. And we also have a capital position that allows us to deploy that.
We don't have to build capital – build our capital base. So our ability to continue to grow deposits and deploy that
into a higher yielding loan is what we're looking at. [ph] 92% (43:46) loan-to-deposit ratio. As Bryan said, when we
add securities and they're right at the peer median, we feel really good about the trajectory we're on, which is why
we believe that we will improve our margin in the coming quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And one final point is, look, we're fortunate in the fact that we get to do business in great markets, great
economies, and on a relative basis, we think that they will outperform the US economy. So we're – I think we're in
a good spot to see positive momentum in our deposit base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
It's good to be in the south, I agree. And then just my last question is to follow up on your comments about
buyback into 2024. If I heard you correctly, it sounds like instead of getting common equity Tier 1 down to that
9.5% to 10.5%, you kind of just want to hold it relatively flat at 11%. Did I understand that correct? And then what
would it take for you to consider a more elevated level of buyback that could potentially get that common equity
Tier 1 number down into your range? Is it more economic uncertainty or what would you like to see to take that
lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, that's – what you said is a rough approximation of what I said, which is that as we look at it today, we're
likely to keep that CET1 ratio given the board support at a constant level around that 11% area – 11.1% area. To
bring it down further, I think we and the board would have to be confident that we had greater certainty about the
direction of the economy and how things were more likely to play out. So it's not to say that that's completely off
the table, but as we sit here today, it still feels like 2024 in terms of [indiscernible] (45:36) economic outlook is still
a little more uncertain than we would like. We don't see it as extremely negative. We just see it as more uncertain
than we think. Maintaining a strong capital base tends to be more in our favor than bringing it down prematurely.

Operator: We now have Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. In the second quarter, you added about $6 billion in deposits
from the new campaigns and then you added another $1 billion in 3Q. As the rates on these campaigns move
lower in 4Q, how confident are you that you can retain both these deposit balances as well as most-- more
importantly, the overall client relationships that you've added?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So we recognize that when you attract new customer relationships, I think the number was something like
32,000 in the second quarter. About 25,000 of those being retail. I think it was about 19,000 new bank accounts in
the third quarter, that not only is it important that you attract a new relationship that you broaden and deepen it,
and our bankers all across our markets are working every single day to broaden and deepen the relationships
with those new customer relationships, new bank customers. So we have a high degree of confidence that we will
retain a significant portion of those. I don't sit around and think we're going to retain every one of them, but we
have a high degree of confidence that we can broaden and deepen with a significant number of those
relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then total deposit growth was really strong in the quarter supported by the campaigns, but the non-
interest-bearing deposits continued to decline. On the guidance slide, you point to DDA balances returning to pre-
pandemic levels, but it looks like you're very close to that level of 27%. So I guess how much more do you see to
get there and by what time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
On a pre-pandemic percentage, you're right. We're at about the 27% which is where we were, but on a absolute
value, we're about $2 billion higher. We've done the analysis of operating accounts and we think on the downside
and we look at how much is in the account versus how much they're using, there's only about $2 billion to $3
billion of additional credit versus debit each quarter. So we don't feel – we're not losing clients. It's balances that
have moved to interest-bearing, and it's clients are holding less cash in their operating accounts. The inflationary
environment that they have, the macroeconomic environment that they're working in, they are holding less cash in
operating accounts. And we think if you look at the absolute value, they really got to the point they were – we had
the exact same amount of debits and credits in every client account, we'd be in exactly kind of a dollar-wise where
we are. We are working very hard to attract new DDA clients as well. As you mentioned, we just launched a new

program this quarter – a new marketing campaign in this current quarter, and a program to go after that. It is a
factor of two things there, which is one was the mix we saw earlier in the year, and two, just our clients have less
cash on hand in their operating accounts these days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then my last question, at Investor Day, you provided an ROTCE range of 15% to 18% through the
cycle, but your adjusted ROTCE this quarter was just over 9%. I know the elevated charge-offs this quarter
weighed on that, but how are you thinking about the previous range of 15% to 18% for ROTCE that you provided
at Investor Day? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. That's a through the cycle number. And we still believe that will be the number. If you look at this quarter
and we take out the one charge-off, we add about 3.2% back to ROTCE. So we get closer to our range. As Bryan
and I have talked about earlier, we are looking to create positive operating leverage. We're looking to return
capital to shareholders. And so we still do run our company and look at through the cycle, that being our targeted
range. We have no reason to believe that we can't hit that or that we should bring that down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
As we've talked about in a number of different times, we're running at higher capital levels today, and we believe
[indiscernible] (50:13) through the cycle range as well, that has an impact on that. So we still have high degree of
confidence that through the cycle, we can drive those to sort of mid to higher teens ROTCE.

Hi. Thanks. You've previously mentioned about how you're open to doing a potential MOE for scale benefits and
crossing the $100 billion in assets. I was wondering what factors could accelerate a potential deal and what
factors could push out a potential deal? Any updated thoughts there would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I'd say there are more factors pushing it out than there are bringing it in. I think they're opposite sides of the
same coin in some sense. But I think that the M&A environment is likely to be very, very minimal over the next
couple of years. Part of that is economic. Part of that is interest rate marks. And I still think as demonstrated over
the last few quarters, uncertainty about regulatory approval processes in addition to the proposed rules around
Basel III, and make anything unlikely in the near term. And I would guess – our view is it's probably two years,

three years before – anywhere from a 1.5 years to 3 years before you really start to see a pickup in M&A activity.
So that's not something that's on our radar screen today.

Makes sense. Thanks for that. And shifting over to loan growth and the increased guidance to 7% to 9%, I was
curious what areas are you leaning into with the increased loan growth guidance?

Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So we do see some opportunities where other banks have pulled out completely. So we've got some opportunities
in mortgage warehouse lending. We've got some opportunities in what I would just call [indiscernible] (54:26) in
our markets. We can talk about generational opportunities to bring over the family owned companies and the
markets that we continue to serve. There's also some opportunities in asset-based lending. One of the reasons
that we think this could be attractive too is we are seeing some ability to have widening spreads and even more
conservative underwriting. So things like more upfront equity, better covenants, more opportunities to have [ph]
guarantor and sponsor, risk scores (55:01) that kind of thing.

We're – I'm sorry to interrupt. We're always opportunistic as we think about how we grow high value relationships.
And that's through all economic cycles. And so we're always thinking about how we grow the business. The other
thing that's driving the growth, if you look at a substantial portion of the growth in the third quarter of this year, it
continues to be what I've described in the past, the spring-loaded nature of our balance sheet and that we have
some continued fund-up of construction assets which is driving the growth. Organic growth has slowed. It does
feel like lending activity more broadly in the economy and what we see from customers has slowed and is likely to
continue to slow. But we will be opportunistic and look to grow our business and to grow our customer base by
using our balance sheet in appropriate ways to support customers and communities.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A – [004877-E]Bryan Jordan – First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)> Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a question on loan growth too. David kind of stole my question but that's okay. I guess the question for you,
Bryan, is this – do you feel like this is a sustainable pace of growth, this kind of 1% to 2% sequential growth as
you look out into 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, right now, I think as I tried to mention or say, articulate, some of the growth is just going to be natural in the
fund-up of some of these construction loans as projects get completed. And these are project that, as Susan has
described, continue to be on track and continue to look good. So that will drive some of it. In the middle of this
quarter, it started to feel a little more like – really in the back half of this quarter, it started to feel like starting to
slow down in customer demand and customer activity. So it does feel like things will be a bit slower. But I do think
there's opportunities to continue to selectively add relationships and credits. And a lot of euphemisms are out
there about the [indiscernible] (57:41) and things like that. We're not in that mode. We do think that we can use
our balance sheet to support customers and communities, and it's one of the benefits of having a strong capital
base and being in a position to compete effectively for new relationships when we see, as Susan described,
generational opportunities or otherwise to strengthen our customer pool across the entire franchise we serve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And just somewhat related, I know you were asked this at Investor Day, but the balance sheet growth
expectation at your size – it feels like you have a couple of year runway and maybe you think about $100 billion in
asset threshold later. But any limits on your balance sheet growth in the near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No real short-term limits. I think we've got a few years of runway and if necessary, we can tread water. So we
understand where that bright line is. And we're going to be very intentional about not inadvertently stumbling over
that threshold. So until we get greater clarity about what that regulatory landscape looks like, we will do all we can
to grow the balance sheet, and at the same time, not inadvertently stumble over it. But we think we've got a few
years. It's not an immediate concern in the near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. Just a small one too. One of the numbers that you flagged was the 19,000 new checking accounts as
part of the deposit campaign. Is that a material number to you? I know it's just a quarterly number. And what
drove that, and is that repeatable?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, it's an important number because it's 19,000 new relationships. It probably compares to about – it compares
to a base of around, call it, 900,000 customer relationships. So it's not an insignificant number. We, in a given
quarter, will lose a few as well, but it is important to know that our bankers are out there front footed, that they're
acquiring customer relationships in the marketplace across the entire footprint. And as I said earlier in this call,
clearly, it's not just about that first account. It is we want to build a relationship. I mentioned the tenure of our
customer relationships. We want to broaden and deepen those relationships. So I guess it was the old proverb
about every journey starts with the first step. I mean, it's that first account. And then we broaden and deepen from
there is our goal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, this is Hope. The other reason that we've called that out is it shows that we're growing our deposit one client
at a time. We're not out there buying big municipal fundings. It's not [ph] forward (01:00:44) deposits. We're truly
acquiring clients and that's why our deposits are growing. I know others have [indiscernible] (01:00:49) they're
talking about big chunks of money. We are doing it one client at a time and because we believe the way that our
franchise will excel and succeed is to bring these clients in with their first product and then sell them and make
them long, deep relationships that are with us for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Okay. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open,
Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi. This is [indiscernible] (01:01:28) for Timur. Just kind of a longer-term question about your CET1, your long-
term CET1 target in the 9.5% to 10.5% range. I guess has there been any preliminary work done on what that
could move to, if at all, as – if you were to cross that $100 billion mark? Or is that already factored into the range
provided? And just how that would maybe impact your long-term capital return plans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We have done some very preliminary work, but given the sort of state of flux of the Basel III proposals and
how it impacts various tiers above the $100 billion threshold, we haven't really factored that into our long-term
goals at this point. And if in fact we do something that puts us above that $100 billion threshold, whether it's
through organic growth or otherwise, we'll update at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay, great. And then just one clarification question on the expense guidance. Does the guidance for the full year
assume that FDIC special assessment [ph] hits in (01:02:57) 4Q or has that not been included yet?

Hope Dmuchowski A

No. We don't have that in expenses. We have it as an adjusted item. It is in our capital forecast. But for the
expense guidance, we're excluding that as an adjusted item.

Okay, great. That's helpful. Okay, that's all that I had. Thank you very much.
