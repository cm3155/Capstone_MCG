Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast and thank you for joining us today. I
hope that everyone is doing well and hopefully some sense of normalcy is returning to your daily lives. Earlier this
morning we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.21 for the three months ended June 30, 2020, up
11% compared to the year ago quarter and up 5% compared to the previous quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.02 ahead of analysts' consensus estimates. We are very pleased with our
results this quarter. Despite significant pandemic related challenges, economic uncertainty and social unrest
during the quarter, the company performed well as we continued to execute on our time tested strategy.
Before I discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to provide some color on our deferral
program. After an expected initial surge in payment deferrals, in April, the pace of new deferral requests slowed
dramatically during the second quarter.
Our deferral program is somewhat unique in that, it is for an initial six month period as opposed to a three month
period. Therefore any positive changes will not be evident until the fourth quarter of the year. As noted in today's
presentation at June 30, multi-family and in CRE full payment deferrals totaled $5.9 billion or 15.5% of
outstanding balances and weighted average LTV was 56%.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Specifically, multi-family deferrals were $3.7 billion or 11.7% of the portfolio and had an LTV of 57%, while CRE
deferrals were $2.2 billion or 32.5% of portfolio and had an LTV of 52%. The company has gone through many
economic cycles and while this one is indeed different, our stringent underwriting guidelines and our longevity in
the market which have served us well during previous cycles are serving us well now.
Today, the New York City real estate market especially our non-luxury, rent regulated multi-family niche has held
up extremely well. Rent collections continue to be above levels we experienced in the second quarter. In fact, we
have seen month-over-month improvements throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter.
Moreover, New York City has recently entered Phase 4 of its reopening and many people are returning to work
and many businesses are also starting to reopen. This along with state, rent, subsidies so landlord is having a
positive impact on our borrowers cash flow.
We remain optimistic that as we get deeper into Phase 4 and business and economic activity in our market begins
to increase, the number of borrowers in deferral will decline dramatically. We look forward to sharing our results
during our third quarter earnings call as approximately 96% of all borrowers on deferral programs come off their
deferrals in October and November.
Moving now to our second quarter results.
Our second quarter performance was very strong and reflects significant expansion in our net interest margin,
solid top line revenue growth and lower operating expenses. This led to double digit pre-provision net revenue
growth which is a good indicator of how well-positioned we are in the current environment.
At the same time our provisions for credit losses declined compared to the first quarter while our asset quality
metrics remained strong and multi-family loan growth continued. We also announced that the board of directors
declared a $0.17 cash dividend for common share. The dividend will be payable on August 18 to common
shareholders of record as of August 8. Based on yesterday's closing price, this translates into an annualized
dividend yield of 6.6%.
The major highlight of our second quarter performance is a substantial double-digit improvement in our interest
margin. The net interest margin excluding the impact from prepayment income was 2.09%, up 17 basis points
sequentially and up 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We were especially pleased with the progress
made on our funding costs. Our cost of the deposits declined to 1.46% during the second quarter, down 36 basis
points on a linked-quarter basis and down 60 basis points, year-over-year.
This was driven by a decline in our average cost of deposits mostly due to the downward repricing of our CDs.
Net interest income also excluding the impact from prepayment income rose $21 million, or 9% compared to the
previous quarter and $29 million or 13% compared to the year ago quarter.
We continued to be well-positioned for further improvements in both the margin and net interest income given the
re-pricing opportunities embedded within our funding mix. On the expense front, our operating expenses continue
to trend lower. Total non-interest expenses were $124 million, down 2% compared to the prior quarter and
relatively unchanged, compared to a year ago quarter. The efficiency ratio was 44% and continues to reflect
positive operating leverage.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
I would like to point your attention to our pre-provision net revenue number, where we showed strong double-digit
improvements, compared to the first quarter of this year and compared to the year ago second quarter. PPNR for
the second quarter was $158 million, up 16% and 19% respectively. We view this number as an important metric
to focus on as it shows the earnings power of the company and our ability to absorb the credit costs, generate,
capital and support our commitment to the dividend.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total loans were $42.3 billion, relatively unchanged compared to the previous
quarter as good growth in multi-family portfolio was offset by decline in the CRE and the specialty finance
portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, total loans are up, $412 million or 2% annualized.
After seeing some modest growth in multi-family portfolio in the first quarter, total multi-family loan growth was
stronger this quarter, increasing $325 million on a sequential basis to $31.6 billion or up 4% annualized. However,
this was tempered by a $114 million sequential decline in the specialty finance portfolio and a $105 million decline
in the CRE portfolio. The linked-quarter decrease in the specialty finance portfolio was primarily due to
commercial borrowers reducing inventory and some larger borrowers accessing the public markets to raise capital
and using the proceeds to pay down debt.
Despite this, we see the specialty finance business reverting to form next quarter. Origination activity continued to
be very strong as total loan originations, excluding PPP loans increased 21% on a linked-quarter basis to $3.3
billion, led by multi-family originations, which increased 70% to $2.4 billion. Second quarter originations exceeded
last quarter's pipeline by $1.2 billion or 60%.
Speaking of the pipeline, we continue to see strong demand from our borrowers as our current pipeline is $2.2
billion, 5% greater than the first quarter pipeline. Importantly, included in the pipeline is approximately $1.3 billion
or 60% of new money.
On the funding side, total deposits declined $243 million or 3% on an annualized basis, compared to the prior
quarter. Continuing the trend from the prior quarter, CDs declined $2.1 billion primarily due to the drop in market
interest rates at the end of the first quarter and the company's strategy to significantly reduce the rates it offers on
CDs.
Most of this decline was offset by solid growth in other lower cost deposit categories. Our wholesale borrowings
increased modestly compared to the previous quarter and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York increased $75 million.
On the asset quality side, our overall asset quality metrics continue to be very strong. We reported a provision for
credit losses under CECL of $18 million, down from the $21 million as we reported in the first quarter of the year.
This exceeded net charge offs by $14 million and led to an increase in the allowance for loan losses.
We had no charge offs in either quarter in our core portfolios. Net charge offs totaled $4 million or 0.01% of
average loans compared to $10 million or 0.02% of average loans in the prior quarter. The majority of the charge
offs in both periods were taxi medallion related. Non-performing assets were relatively stable, increasing $4
million or 7% compared to the first quarter level. This translates into 12 basis points of total assets compared to
11 basis points last quarter.
Excluding non-performing taxi medallion-related assets, NPAs would have been $30 million or 5 basis points of
total assets compared to $28 million last quarter also 5 basis points of total assets. Lastly, I'd like to end my
formal comments by once again thanking all those who continue to serve on the front line of this crisis.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
The doctors, the nurses and all other first responders and to our employees, management and board here at New
York Community who have shown extraordinary dedication during this most difficult time. On that note, I would
now ask the operator to open the line for your questions. We will do our best to get all of your questions within the
time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later in the week. Operator?

America. Please proceed.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess just first, if you could just update us on the net interest margin, very strong this quarter, but CD cost to net
2%. Tom, just talk to us in terms of your previous guidance of double-digit margin expansion every quarter this
year. Do you still expect that and what are we seeing on the multi-family loans yields and the CD cost as we look
into the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Good morning, Ebrahim. So that's right. We had an improved in the Q2, obviously the margin was a beat, we
expected the margins to be up 10 basis points, it was up 17 basis point. Going into Q3 and Q4, we still anticipate
double-digit margin expansion for each quarter throughout the remainder of 2020.
So we're very bullish about the margin improving further from here given that we still have a substantial amount of
CDs re-pricing as well as borrowings re-pricing and overall spreads in the multi-family side are still very strong. If
you think about it in the next three months we have about $5.4 billion of CDs re-pricing at 1.99% and going out for
the next 12 months is $12.7 billion is going to be priced at 1.69%.
Our current offering rate right now in the market, our highest rate is 65 basis points, that's a seven month CD and
many customers are just going into the short-term CD which is three months at 50 basis points. And in many
circumstances many customers are just ending up in post-maturity as given the pandemic and that's a 2 basis
points cost of funds and the type of post-maturity numbers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
So we've been clearly getting significant improvements there. As far as overall yields on the multi-family side, we
were very fortunate to have that very nice spread throughout the pandemic, so we're still around that 300 basis
point spread albeit there's been some competition as of late from the agencies. So we're mindful of that, but the
economics spread clearly is a much better spread than it was in the previous year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. I guess just moving to the multi-family space, talk to us in terms of what do you expect like if you can –
activity you gave pipeline numbers, but just what's the health of the market as you think about coming out of this
COVID. Clearly a lot of concerns around the New York City economy, like do you really expect a lot of activity and
buyers coming in? Is there enough price discovery happening, give us some color on that and your expectations
for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, I think what's encouraging is that, you know we've improved our retention rate as expected this year
about the 50 percentile. So the goal here to get to a 5% net loan growth story for 2020 was to get our people
focused on what's coming due as you're aware of this significant amount of money coming due in the next few
years, so we're targeting those types of customers and anticipating a very high retention rate as compared to the
previous year.
Although 50% – I think the number was 52% for the quarter. We anticipate that to continue throughout the year.
That is key for our expectations to continue our net loan growth story for 2020. As far as purchase and sales
transactions as you can imagine, during the COVID pandemic, there wasn't any. We're hearing there's some
deals that are coming through in Q3 and Q4 and we'll be mindful of that.
So we believe that the second half will be the opportunity to see some activity in the marketplace but it's been
pretty much at a zero level throughout the second quarter because of the COVID pandemic. That being said, we
have a very strong pipeline $2.2 billion of that 60% of that is new money and the yield is still very strong. I believe
the overall pipeline yield coming out into the third quarter is about a 324 yield. So that's an impressive yield, it's
still hovering around that 300 basis points spread.

Good morning, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I wanted to first if you can give us a sense for what rent collections looked like today on your rent regulated, non-
rent regulated multi-family buildings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So Mark, I would tell you that – go ahead, Joe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I was just going to say that our rent collections have been quite strong despite the expectations or the
headlines that are occurring with regard to other lenders in our circumstance, we're in a very good place and it's
not atypical for us to have tenants that have every expectation and capacity to stay in their apartments. So we're
getting a very good flow of payments from our tenants.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Mark, I would say specifically when you look at quarter-over-quarter, was well above that 85 to 90 percentile
on rent collected from the – obviously the multi-family. So that is very strong. Each month as we evaluate that, it's
becoming stronger as we go through the summer months here.
So as far as the third quarter is concerned, obviously we're – it's beginning of the – end of July, and we see some
very strong numbers coming through as far as collections. As far as the overall portfolios, when you think about
the deferrals and you look, think about what's going on with the multi-family side, I believe approximately 42% of
those loans that are in deferral have a 100% rent regulated on the multi-family side.
In the total multi-family side, I believe 62% had some form of rent regulation. So we're mindful that given the
magnitude of the rent stabilized portfolio and the level of the payments that's coming in, we feel very confident
that those customers will revert back to full payment status as we get back to the second half of year, because
our payment deferral program starts to kick in – into October or November. So we're mindful of that timeframe
change, however the good news here is that the collection that we seek is we have the operating accounts, we're
seeing the money coming in on a monthly basis, so we're very pleased with the overall cash flows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then I know asset quality is really been amazing there over time, but does it make sense to continue to
build reserves, given the uncertainties today in the world?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Well, Mark, you know that the history – the company's history has a pristine asset quality metric. So if you think
about we adopted CECL in Q1 quantitative versus qualitative. I would allocate two-thirds of our reserve is at this
point in time qualitative and a third is quantitative because we don't have a history of any significant losses.
So we think about the magnitude of the rent stabilized portfolio, we – these numbers are high for us. So obviously
we were very public about our guidance that Q1, we felt that was going to be the largest reserve towards adoption
of CECL as we monitor the macroeconomic backdrop that'll change over time. But it appears that given the
current portfolio is leaning towards, we anticipate to have a very manageable transition as we go towards the end
of the year and hopefully as the city comes back to full Phase 4, we'll start to see better performance metrics, but
it's – a guidance is too soon to tell, but the overall macroeconomic backdrop when we want it, through our CECL
calculations, it's mostly qualitative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then lastly, I think you said in the release you have $103 million of PPP loans held-for-sale. What are
the economics of holding those loans versus selling them today look like and is – is that the plan to sell those in
3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. It's immaterial, it's a $100 million on 1% type return, it's not going to be a – its immaterial number. That plus
the fees are insignificant for the company. We will – you can imagine, most of our customers were not eligible.
Property owners, given their structure were not eligible to tap the PPP funds. So we were there for our customers
that had eligibility and also for customers that were not getting – non-customers that were not getting access to
PPP to the money center bank. So we stepped in locally as a community player. However, we did not do a whole
lot of PPP. We had the program in place but most of our customers were not eligible.

Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
I just want to start just on the loan growth front, you mentioned in terms of the quarter you're expecting
[indiscernible] (00:23:29) quarter, you're expecting a rebound in the specialty finance portfolio. Kind of wondering
what drives comfort there. And then just for the back half of the year, pipeline looking pretty good, it's kind of like,
your – do you still think, close to mid-single digits for 2020 is good or maybe just – or is it below?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, so Steve, I would say, we still feel very confident that the second half will be stronger than the first half. And
obviously, we're coming out of the depths of the pandemic and with respect to specialty finance, that's – it's
obvious many companies were buckling down their cash position, they were hovering, managing inventory
differently, given the lack of economic activity. That will pick up.
Capital markets were very strong for that business, so many of these A-rated companies had access to very
attractive alternative financing to the capital markets and they paid – they accumulated lots of cash and payed
down some of their shorter term liabilities.
We anticipate them to draw down some cash as they build up more inventory for anticipated better economic
activity as the country comes out of the pandemic. So we believe that we should be on track and I mean the
growth has been phenomenal in specialty finance over the years. I believe we'll still be on track for that 25% to
28% type net – net growth in – on specialty finance. I think if you look at where we are today, we're 23%
annualized. So we should see some growth for specialty finance for the second half of the year.
As far as multi, the multi-family is driven predominantly right now from within our own portfolio as well as getting
other transactions within the marketplace refinancing. It's not purchase and sales. We believe eventually there will
be the opportunity where buyers and sellers come together and we will participate in the financing of that.
So it's been very slow in Q2 as expected. We've been doing a bunch of non-dealer road shows, Joe and I and
we've been very public that didn't expect to see a whole lot of growth. We were very pleased that we did have net
multi-family growth for the quarter. And we anticipate that to pick up in second half, that means for us based on
our retention of north of 50% of our own portfolio, we should be in line to get that low mid-single – low
[indiscernible] (00:25:25) mid-single digit net loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the provision in this quarter, kind of curious as to what the
economic assumptions and the drivers were there?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
I mean pretty much obviously we're more inclined to deal with the issues from [indiscernible] (00:25:42) economic
forecast. We have the most recent [indiscernible] (00:25:45) baseline forecast that's – that was released as of
April 28, as of March 31.
And we have the Moody's economic scenario which is the baseline forecast released on June 9 as of May 31. So
those are the – the current forecasts that we run with. I'd say for us, it's more driven off a property price declines
since we're real estate based, we're not a CNI lender.
So you think about unemployment and bankruptcies alike, that really drive some of the CNI players. So when you
look at the overall backdrop economic landscape that we're using, we still have a substantial amount of this CECL
calculation that's qualitative just because of the history of the bank that has no losses as we look at the portfolio.
But clearly, property price declines will then drive our CECL more so than unemployment factor.

Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Just on the deferrals, do you – so providing the vacancy rates in the multi-
family book was super helpful. Thank you for that in the slide deck. But just curious how those vacancy rates
might look on the deferred loans? Do you have that by any chance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So -- so – again, we're going to be one quarter behind everybody else given the nature of our program, Collyn. So
as Ficalora indicated in his prepared remarks, we have a six-month program. I will tell you with certainty where we
stand today, the conversations we're having with our customers is getting out of the program because they're
ready to pay.
So we haven't had any adverse discussions about people looking for extension. But it's too early to tell. With that
being said, we did a relatively deep dive into the portfolio that we have, it's on deferral. We looked at our CRE
book on retail, we looked at our CRE book on office. And what we've determined when we pulled the files and we
went back to the customers and tried to evaluate the cash flows, it appears that when we look at the retail
portfolio, we have reviewed approximately 90% of our CRE retail deferrals and 74% of those loans reviewed,
11

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
have rents coming from the essential businesses, 54% of those loans reviewed have 50% or more of the rents
coming from the essential businesses.
So, that gives us some encouragement that despite the pandemic, they were still collecting the booking sales, so
obviously they have the capacity to pay some form back to the bank and as far as debt service coverage. In
respect to office, a little bit different. We reviewed approximately, we're still in the process. We reviewed
approximately 70% of the CRE office deferrals and of that 88% of those loans reviewed have rents coming from
the essential businesses of which 31% of the loans reviewed have more than 50% coming from essential
businesses.
So, they are still open, I mean not everyone is open, but they were getting into phase 4 and we feel that overall
we should have a good showing at the end of the year with a lot of these particular credits coming off deferral.
Just another note there on the specialty finance side, a 100% of our specialty finance loans coming off deferral in
July, made their payments. So, we had approximately $200 million in total, I believe $90 million has – we have
$90 million that paid in July, we believe the rest will be procured in August. So, we're very confident that there's
very low loss content – no loss content in the – in the specialty finance business.

Okay. That's very helpful. And just kind of along those lines, right, if we – if we play this out, everything that's
happening, New York City and understanding obviously things are starting to open up, but it's so – the city is just
obviously so different than what it was before. If we play this through, I mean where do you when you – some of
your borrowers, where would vacancy rates need to go to really start to stress some of your borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, it's an interesting point, obviously our debt coverage – our debt coverage ratio at a point of origination are
very strong. Obviously that changed as there's no income coming in. So we think about the weighted average
debt service coverage ratio and we expect to – our CRE portfolio.
I believe that number is 170, so think about the coverage there. We typically underwrite at a more conservative
level as Mr. Ficalora indicated, the average LTV is low, 51.92%, and when we look at the areas that we want to
say may have more difficulty, let's say, for example commercial mixed use where you have more of a
concentration of businesses struggling to reopen and you have less residential above that, that LTV is at 48%.
So you really have real deep equity embedded in these credits and a lot to walk away from. So no one is knocking
on the door and saying here take my keys, I don't have a 48% LTV. So we're in a very good spot. We believe that
it's going to take a little time for some of those other types of credits. However when you look at the majority of the
portfolio, which is multi-family, rent collections are high.
They are 90 percentile which is pretty impressive and we – bear in mind, we have lots of stimulus within the –
within the government intervention today and probably more to come, which will continue to help people pay their
rents and then we have high unemployment pockets within the city, different aspects of the city in particular the
Bronx.
And I would say on LTV perspective, we were very cautious in Manhattan, so our overall LTV in Manhattan are
always lower. The numbers are just more and more attractive as far as how we lend in Manhattan than we do in
the Bronx because of we're very cautious about cap rates and the value of expansion over the past 20 years. So

we think that we have a very low leverage portfolio with debts backed by a substantial amount of wealthy property
owners that have real long-term equity built into the game here.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. The rent rolls are very stable in our buildings because the people themselves, the tenants have rent control,
rent stabilization. They can't move to a new building and get that same benefit. So they want to maintain that
apartment, they want to maintain rent control, so we have a very high concentration of people, tenants that are
inclined to stay in the buildings they're in because they have huge economic advantage. That really plays
extremely well even in an environment such as this.

Okay. And then just one follow-up; just another kind of broad question in terms of your pipeline right, you said
60% is new money. What's kind of – what's the sort of the background of the dynamic of that, of those borrowers
coming in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Just getting business from other banks, right? We're in the space, this is our core business model. Other banks
that are going through their own issues and struggling, we focus in this multi-family CRE niche, in this particular
marketplace, so clearly getting loans from other banks that are coming up for renewal.
You can imagine how much is out there that has to be renewed. We have a substantial amount of our own loans
that have to be renewed in the next year and half, so that's going to be their focus until the property transactions
start to occur. We believe that will eventually pick up and the good news there is you're starting from zero. So
we're growing with no property transaction. When the market does pick up, we believe we'll be a participant there
and do solid credits.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, Tom. In terms of your expectation for the low- to- mid-single-digit loan growth this year, is that going to be
driven by the rebound especially finance or more on the multi-family side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say both. I mean obviously we were slightly down in Q2 on specialty finance. We've been historically growing
here very nicely. We've turned down a lot of deals, there's more pricing this quarter, but we had as I indicated
significant access to the capital markets and given the pandemic, many businesses were slow to react and they
were hovering cash.
As the economy opens up, these businesses will draw down. We have some other businesses that were drawing
down because they were very busy for example in Albertson for example. They're taking down financing because
they have a tremendous amount of selling of groceries.
So there's an example of one taking down credit while others are hovering credit. We think we'll see some good
momentum on the cars and inventory as there's – there is a tremendous demand. There is no inventory out there
to sell cars.
But I think for the most part, I think all of our core businesses and especially finance was thought at least
accessing credit on their line, we have a very significant line. If you look at the -- the roll forward of our reserve,
we had a large commitment contingency built on CECL because of the substantial line because we had so many
pay-offs.
But we think that'll improve and as far as multi-family, we think that we'll continue to grow throughout the year
hopefully at a stronger pace in the second half and CRE is on the table. CRE is one up here in the [ph] Haven
(34:22). I don't envision a lot of CRE growth, but pure CRE. But multi-family and specialty finance should be the
contributing factors towards the plug for that potentially mid-single digit net loan growth that we plan to achieve for
the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then it sounds like your borrowers are in fairly good financial health. But just out of curiosity, if
they did come through October or November, do you have the ability to put them on another six months deferral?
Or do they have to come off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Sure. Look, you know, there's a lot of flexibility right now because we're still in in a black swan event, a
pandemic that's being supported by the government as well as the regulators. We believe there'll be some further
I guess, guidance as we move along throughout the year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
But we're just one quarter behind Ken and that's – someone's put us in a competitive disadvantage when you talk
about the book because we – I'd love to give you more information but our customers are just in midway through
their deferral program.
We believe that on the multi-family side, given the magnitude of cash flows coming in that we see every day
because we have the bank accounts, we see the operating accounts, and the cash flow coming in, and we talk to
the largest customers, the collections are high and as I indicated, there's a lot of government stimulus that's
assisting that.
As far as office and CRE and commercial mixed use, that is going to be a matter of the reopening phase and the
strength of the borrowers. And given that we're very frugal on our lending and you know we are very focused at
being conservative stringent underwriters, we have a lot of de-value of equity.
So we believe that if they do need help, we can give them help and it's going to be a case by case basis. I know a
lot of our overall customers that are you know just [indiscernible] (00:36:04) smaller mom and pop neighborhood
type businesses will be supported by the tenants as they come back into the city, but the city is still going through
this phase for reopening and it's going to take a little time. But we do have -
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
By the way, we also – yes, just though I can add, we also have a higher rate of interest on every dollar we defer.
So when you take massive amounts of money that are being deferred at rates that we could not get in the
marketplace, it's very attractive to the bottom line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. And Ken, I do have a comment, I'm going to repeat it again, it's important that the conversations we're
having right now is that they don't want accrue any more interest. They want to pay their bills because they have
the cash flow. So as you give them six months of balance sheet time to bring collections in and they have an
abundance of cash, they're still accruing interest.
So they want to stop the accrue of interest and pay and get back to normal payment status, so if you're collecting
most of your rents every month, you have the capacity to pay. That's the conversations that are happening so
we're excited as we go into Q3 and in the beginning of Q4, we should be in a position to see a substantial rollback
of these deferrals and whatever it has to be dealt with, we'll deal with it as it comes along in particular under the
CARES Act, there's lots of flexibility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And it's a really quick last question. In terms of expense outlook, I see expenses came in lower than
your guidance for this quarter. How are you thinking about it for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, it's interestingly, we were – obviously given the pandemic, we're spending less money for the most part,
but we – we are definitely focused on efficiency and the good news is that we anticipate by the end of the year,
15


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
we can hit that 42% efficiency ratio at the – not on the full year average, but hopefully by the – by the quarterly
average and that was the original plan.
So, we probably beat our plan by $10 million to $15 million. So, if we recall back to last year's guidance, we
assume 2020 will be between $510 million and $520 million, we could probably hit $500 million, so I'd say it's – it's
reasonable to bring that down for the year. The $500 million, which will be flat year-over-year, so we're very happy
about where we are. For the quarter, Q3, we'll probably be around $125 million – we were $124 million last
quarter, which will be around the same.
So, we're very pleased with the containment efforts that we are showing here as a business, but it's well-
contained and hopefully as we have growth, we'll have operating leverage with significant margin expansion as
we're going through -throughout 2020. Margins holding up very nicely and we still – we still feel highly confident
that we'll have that double-digit margin expansion every quarter this year.
Now, we got a lot of margin in – we got a lot of margin in Q2 more than I expected, 70% better than guidance, but
that had a lot to do with the dynamic of the marketplace and the accelerant Fed adjustments that were taken
place and as we can all realize, we are liability sensitive, double-digit liability sensitive institutions, so we should
benefit from lower to longer scenario by the Fed.

Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We are under the CARES Act, we believe we have flexibility right now, because if you have a building that has no
cash flow, you're not going to be penalized on the previous year's financial statement if no one is paying – if
there's no – if the business is closed.
So we think there'll be flexibility there. We've actually had considerable dialogue regarding that throughout the
industry. When we reopen fully and we look at the new cash flows we believe that there's some good coverage. In
the most part our coverage is very high. I indicated that we're 170 on our CRE book. I believe our multi-family
book that was in the deferral was at 153. So there's a lot of room there as we get to that stage.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, you can imagine with an abundance of caution obviously. I will tell you that when customers are pulling
down some money to cash out refi, we're very conservative. We're holding back multiple months of proceeds,
we're holding back escrow, we're holding back any items that we felt needs to be escrowed as far as, as we get to
the pandemic.
We are also taking out a certain percentage of an adjustment based on appraised value just because as an
abundance of caution. And if you're not selling your building and you wanted – you have to refi and you think you
have real value, we're willing to do cash out refi but at a much less of an amount. Now we may lose deals

because of that and that's fine, this will be – we're an abundance of caution type lender, that's the history lender,
that's the history of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks. And then just moving on, your loan spreads are still pretty high, if rates are permanently at this
level, would you expect the spreads to remain where they are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Steve, we're going to be in the market, so obviously we had a good shot in Q2, as the agencies pull back. The
agencies are back today, so there's no – let's not fool ourselves that we do compete with the government. The
government is probably the largest player in the marketplace. And they've tightened up their spreads but they also
hovering on yield maintenance.
And if you are comfortable with yield maintenance, then you may go with the government, some of the largest
players will go with the government and put that loan on the shelf for, an extended period of time. But for the most
part of the portfolio lending, given that flexibility as far as structure, personal guarantees, as well as dealing with
cross [ph] validization (00:42:09), we have the ability to be competitive and I'd say the biggest fear today is that
we have to deal with the government and the government rates tend to be tightened when they have a large
appetite and their appetite is significant. But we'll compete and if we have to be a little bit less than $300, we'll be
within the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And just one last one from me. Joe, you'd mentioned that people are headed back to work with the
reopening in New York market. Roughly in your opinion, where are we, in terms of the activity versus a year ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, you know, it's very hard to say because there's not consistency in how this evolves. But I would say to you
that that the marketplace today and prospectively represents depending on the nature of the asset, the kind of
asset we're talking about.
A period of uncertainty that has the potential for some of the revenue sources to dissipate. Most important,
however for us is that we have the vast majority of our people are tenants that have extraordinarily attractive rents
and they want to maintain those relationships.
They are highly motivated to do that. So despite the fact that there could be a first floor tenant that is not deriving
revenue because there are not sufficient numbers of people in the marketplace using their store.
The vast majority of the rents we collect are not driven by that. So I'd say that we're in a good place and we will
continue over the course of this evolving cycle to be in a place where the vast majority of our revenue is in fact
continuing.
We don't have tenants that, even for example if a person is in a rent controlled apartment and they virtually have a
loss of their job, they would borrow money to stay in that apartment because that apartment is the most valuable
19


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
asset they possess. The idea that we will have ongoing revenues from the properties that we lend on is
extraordinarily high and different than the vast majority of lenders in the New York market.
So that distinction needs to be fully grasped. It has occurred cycle after cycle, that's why our assets continue to
perform even in difficult periods. So when massive foreclosures are occurring, our assets are performing, our
owners are actually able to go out and buy the foreclosed properties. So this is not atypical from the standpoint of
the consistency of performance in the unique differences in our asset mix.
But this is a period which will continue to provide opportunity for the owners of our buildings to take advantage of
those buildings that were way overpriced, that did not have a stable good tenancy, that did not have rent control,
rent stabilization as a significant component of the revenue stream. That is for us a distinguishing characteristic.
Anyway, I'm very pleased that our current situation is demonstrating the uniqueness of our business model and I
think as we go quarter by quarter into the future, it'll be more and more obvious in the differences between how
we perform and how others perform.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Matt, I'd say the transactions that you reflect was back in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We had
some notable large 100% rent regulated buildings that traded in those cap rates around 5%. I believe that's still
consistent. There hasn't been an adjustment despite lower interest rates, despite the direction of interest rates.
You think that the – actually on a quarter-over-quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 last year, there was a slight drop, but
with an abundance of caution when you look at the appraisals, you tend to be re-appraising internally and you
tend to put your stopgaps on certain aspects of the rent roll in order to be more conservative.
But I don't think you saw any magnitude adjustment yet in the cap rates. However, it typically correlated to lower –
lower interest rates, so that has not changed much. So the fact that, rates are lower, cap rates have held constant
over the past six months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just looking at the geographic breakdown of your multi-family exposure, there are $6 billion
outside of the state of New York. Just curious how this segment of the portfolio is held up and if there's any major
and notable differences in rent collection.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So we did a deep dive on the portfolio regarding the magnitude of the deferrals. Let's just talk about the
deferrals and when you think about the breakdown, I'd say we have a $1 billion that's in the Bronx, a little less
than a $1 billion in Manhattan, all locations approximately $3.6 billion, most of the deferrals are coming from the
five boroughs.
As far as outside the city, it is insignificant, the deferrals. That kind of gives you an indication that the city was
probably hit the hardest, and we expect to people that it looked for relief as an abundance of caution. I truly
believe that many customers that have multiple assets with the bank, looked at the marketplace when COVID hit
that, the relief was there, let's use the relief, see how we make out and as the cash flow continues to come in
every month and their balance sheets start to swell with excess cash, they are accruing interest.
So I feel highly confident on the multi-family side, that we're going to see a substantial amount of the deferrals,
come off deferrals come up on November 1. That being said, you have a – we don't have a whole lot of exposure
outside of the five boroughs and in New York City marketplace, so we do have our credits in New Jersey. We
have some in Philly, in Baltimore area and Main Line Philly but again, if you think about the magnitude of the
portfolio, it is really New York City dependent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Got it. Okay. You mentioned commercial mixed use as a category that's seeing some stress. Could you just
talk about why that asset class in particular might be or is more exposed in the current environment? Is it just
simply the nature of that bottom poor commercial tenant? And then the amount disclosed which is super helpful is
that so we see a re-mixed use? And I'm just curious if there's ...

So we've identified you know, we'll just – we've identified again, it's in our public filing this morning that the
commercial piece was approximately $334 million of the $706 million. So we have $706 million of commercial
mixed use which is where we believe may have some additional difficulties, given the magnitude of the rent roll
that's still in the process of reopening. And when you think about that as a percentage of the portfolio, that's 47%
of that book is looking for some help because these businesses were completely shut down for the most part.
However the LTV in that book is 48%. So it's a very low leverage portfolio with a very high debt service coverage
ratio upon pre-COVID. And obviously the 65% of the revenue is coming from the ground floor and let's say for
example, you have a five-story walk up, they're going to need maybe additional help down the road, that there's
no question that's a possibility. We don't know it's too soon. But it's just logical to assume that given as the
highest percentage of the deferral, is where the area of focus is.

And is there additional mixed use in the multi-family portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Remember the way we categorize it, is multi-family versus commercial, it's over 7 percentage, it goes into
commercial. So 60% – 50% goes into – into commercial. Less than that. Many buildings have some component of
ground floor revenue that's come from commercial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, could you just talk about M&A. In this environment you do have a currency
advantage. Are there any discussions taking place and if so, could you just talk about that a little bit and then
remind us of what you're looking for in terms of geography, size, balance sheet profile and a partner?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Yes. I think there's no escaping the fact that we have a long history of being informed as to the kinds of
opportunities that the marketplace presents. Our currency is very well-suited in many cases, not all, but in many
cases our currency is very well-suited to create accretive transactions.
So there are partners who have sort of dialogue so as to understand whether we do or do not and under what
circumstances, we might be willing to do a transaction. It is part and parcel of how we look at the value creation
that we've accomplished over our public life and that we intend to accomplish into the future.
There are no banks that we've combined with, that didn't wind up having a substantially better performing
currency. Their investment in their company paid them far more by investing with us. So, as you very well may
imagine, there were many people who are very familiar with and then I'm talking about not just CEOs, but also
bankers that are very familiar with our track record and our desire to do accretive deals.
So you could assume that we have opportunities that are being analyzed and that there is good reason to believe
that the future period will present adequate opportunity for us to execute on an accretive deal. Importantly, we will
do deals that are good for our shareholders. The only reason we ever do a deal is because we believe it creates
greater value for shareholders. There are no deals that we've ever done that didn't create greater value for our
shareholders. So yes, in this period and in the period, which may become more difficult into the future, there will
be opportunities where the differential between our currency and our target currency should be sufficient to be an
obvious value creation for all of us. There's only one currency in a deal. That's the surviving currency and every
deal we have ever done has created a greater value for those that took our currency.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And Matt, I would just add to Joe's commentary that we're not going to do a transaction that can take on tangible
book value. So that's one of our limiting factors. So as you can imagine as the stock improves, then we will be
more desirable to do something here, but given where our currency is right now as Joe indicated, certain
transactions just can't happen because of the – of the partners currency. It has to be tangible [indiscernible]
(00:54:30) accretive, that's just something that we feel very strongly about.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was curious how much exposure do you guys have to the 1031 Exchange and the reason I ask
is if Joe Biden were to win, part of his tax plan is to eliminate the 1031 exchange tax incentive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. So, Pete, let me – let me handle that one. So, obviously, we do not have a 1031 exchange business, but
our customers do play in that space. So, the value creation that's been created to The New York City real estate
market has been through the 1031 exchange.
As you're fully aware, the deferral of taxation through literally generational holdings is the impetus on many
players being – creating more value time over time over generational holdings as they utilize the tax codes.
Under the Trump administration, they locked in that 1031 exchange for real estate where other lines of
businesses were excluded from that. So, we do not have a business that is a 1031 exchange business. Other
banks do that business. We just participate in the purchase and sales, which facilitates the transaction. So, I will
say with clarity if that does happen, it's not good for real estate.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Hello. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate all the information this morning. I just want to ask about the CET1 ratio
under the scenario that Joe was just talking about with a merger. Is there a lower band to where you may take
that just temporarily on a closing and then obviously it would improve as you've retained earnings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I would say what we talked about capital is king for us. We don't – we have a very strong capital allocation
process because we have a low risk bank, but the last thing we want to do is do a transaction and take our ratios
down.
So, if we were to be successful in announcing a transaction, you'd assume that ratio would improve right at
announcement in a closing. That's clearly one of our deciding factors when we're looking at combining two
institutions together and improving capital position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one. I know you talked a lot about asset yields, but is there any
relation to the history back in 2009 and 2010 when rates reset to how the asset yields held up then? It just seems
if they are holding up better know, and maybe that's an advantage for you, well beyond the current quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, it's interesting that you mentioned that, so obviously, let me just go back to 2014. 2014, and the end of 2013
is where we had the low for longest scenario with the Fed, they have rates close to zero for extended period of
time, which is kind of where we are today, and our cost of deposits was 50 – as low as 58 basis points.
I think right now at a 116 basis points on cost of deposits, so we have a lot of room there. On the asset side, we
had a much stronger asset yield because those rates are coming down from a much higher plateau. The negative
is that you have refi yields coming down to literally slightly less than where they were a year ago.
So the 3.20%s, 3.30%s are being refinanced at 3%, 3.10%, 3.15%. So you're not getting that benefit but the cost
of funds drop is significant. It's conceivable that we can go below the cost of deposit scenario, where we are in
2013 and 2014 if the Fed continues to keep their rates close to zero. That's a very – that's a reasonable scenario.
So you'll make it up on the cost of funds side. We have – and during that period, our borrowing costs are
dramatically higher. So we have approximately $975 million remaining in 2020 at a $178 million on the wholesale
side, and 2021, we have about a $1 billion at 2.03%, and if you think the way the market is on, let's say two year
bullets, three year bullets, it's 40 basis points, 50 basis points, and potentially going lower.
So I think that there is a – the positive here is that we're going to do as much as we can to get reasonable
spreads. We can't control the market but we will be lending. But the cost of liabilities for our model is coming down
significantly in a zero for longer scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
I appreciate all the guidance on the expense side. I was just wondering about the lower comp expense this
quarter, is that where from a reduction in the workforce or lower bonus accruals or some combination of that? And
then if you think there's more capacity for more steps on that front, the back half of the year or even next year and
then maybe on the branch network, what you guys can do there if anything...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

...to capture some expenses there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Let me address the comp numbers straight out because those are driven off of payroll taxes. Q1 is always the
high quarter for the year and you have to true up social security and payroll expenses. So that's the high point.
Our payroll should be relatively consistent so what you saw last quarter should be consistent in Q3 and probably
Q4. As far as branch opportunities, we're always open to looking at leases that are coming due and coming
available.
We rather not take charge and we took one in the beginning of the year that we felt was appropriate, when we
looked at some of these opportunities and as they come along closer to their renewal, we evaluate the profitability
and we will consider that during the – down the road. But clearly we're not looking to take additional charges for
that.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Yes. Okay. And then just one question on the end of the whole deferral process, if you guys have any multi-family
or commercial real estate in deferral that come off at the end of that period and they aren't cash flowing and you
have to call those TDRs and mark those, I know you guys are really well-positioned from an LTV basis, but how
do you mark those if there aren't any appropriate real transaction, you can use in the market at that point or if their
deals going out at much lower prices because assets are coming out of structures and hitting lower bids? And so
what are the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave you're not marking them down, you're just being – TDRs are TDRs. I mean obviously you're correct. I mean
if there's no cash flow, the financial wherewithal from the borrower can't support it. You're going to carry them like
at the [ph] face (1:00:55) value.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Right.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
... and so there is really no good transactions going on and I mean, you're obviously using transactions to figure
out where you value those assets...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
... is there...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We appraise or get updated appraisals, you go through that process. Again, I think you know I would say you're
more inclined to deal with that on the office and retail side and maybe the mixed use.
But on the multi-family side you still have you know a lot of customers here that are getting flushed with cash so
you're correct, that's going – no one is coming out of this unscathed, it's going to be, loans that have to be dealt
with after the process goes through the multiple opportunities of giving them some relief.
But we don't really know exactly when that will call for us, we feel very strongly that we're going to have very
strong statistics to discuss at the end of the year. Bear in mind, we're one quarter behind the entire banking space
as we felt it prudent to give them six months relief in the epicenter of the pandemic.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
We were proved right, you know I can tell you with certainty as we got into Phase 4, businesses are opening right
now and the conversations like I've discussed what we're having is and I don't want to pay, I don't want to accrue
this interest, I don't want to – I want to pay you, so I don't have an interest accrual and that's the ongoing
conversation. There will be some that who have a difficult time and given the low leverage we deal with, we'll work
it out and hopefully there won't be a material number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Have you guys set up any kind of a reserve for an interest income, for some of those loans that are on deferral
where you think they might not be able to come off of it successfully?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Nothing material.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And then I guess just lastly, what are the prospects of actually being able to extend deferrals again, come
October for some of those loans that are having trouble still? We've heard from some banks that accounts may
not allow that. They might force the TDR classification but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
...just curious where you're guys are gearing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, I'd say that there is flexibility and I'm hoping we don't have to go there but if we do have to go there, there's
lots of flexibility. We're in a black swan pandemic event that has to be dealt with, that has significant government
support here.
So, in the event, a business is forced to shut down for extended period of time, I'm assuming there's some
flexibility under the CARES Act that they can't reopen because the government says you can't open what they did
not like to open, there's going to be some flexibility.
You know we deal with a lot of large borrowers. They have a lot of large buildings that are rent regulated, we also
have a lot of large credits and those large credits, some are uniquely positioned, but some of the smaller players
may have the issue of reopening and the capacity and we have to deal with that.
And as that comes to a point where we have to sit down and discuss the next round of deferral, we'll deal with
that. But there's no question that there's flexibility and it's important to note that what we're hearing from the
28

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
industry that there'll be more flexibility coming. I will tell you that all our people are sitting on a number of panels of
potential clarity on how to deal with this after six months. I believe by the time six months comes around, you'll
probably have more clarity from the industry.
