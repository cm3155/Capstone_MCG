Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation.
We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the
presentation and the reconciliations in the Appendix.
And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute
well through a challenging environment. Our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong
balance sheet.
During the quarter, we grew our CET1 ratio to 10.4%, near the top of peers, while still buying in $250 million in
stock. With Non-Core loan run-off of $1.4 billion and deposit growth of $500 million in the quarter, we lowered our
spot loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% at quarter end.
We focused on building up our liquidity even further given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of
travel, adding almost $4 billion to cash and securities. We also built our ACL further to 1.55%, well above our pro
forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3% with our General Office reserve now at 9.5%.
While the balance sheet has been a principal focus, we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, which
should drive strong medium-term performance. Our private bank is being built out. We had a soft launch during
the back half of Q3 and we brought in around $500 million in deposits and investments. Full launch is scheduled
over the next several weeks.
We're executing well on our New York City metro push, our deposit strategies, our TOP programs, our ESG
initiatives and our payments strategy.
Our underlying EPS for the quarter missed the mark slightly at $0.89 as several capital markets deals slipped
from Q3 to Q4 given linked quarter market volatility. This was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third
quarter of 2020, three years ago and prior to several acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital.
The good news here is that the pipelines remain strong and we continue to maintain and grow our market share.
NII, expenses and credit costs all track to expectations.
We included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck, page 5, which breaks out results for our
legacy core business, our private bank start-up investment and the drag from Non-Core.
Note the legacy core performance shows Q3 EPS of $1.08; NIM of 3.33%; and ROTCE of 15.3%. The Private
Bank should turn positive by mid-2024 and be nicely accretive in 2025, and Non-Core will dramatically run down
over the next several quarters. This dynamic will help offset the drag from forward-starting swaps and help propel
results higher over time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Given the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates, we've initiated a zero-based
review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in 2024. We'll report further on this on our January call when
we give 2024 guidance.
For Q4, we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize, NII will decline, but by less than in the past two quarters.
Fees should bounce back somewhat, though the extent is market-dependent. Expenses and credit costs should
be stable, and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan run-off.
This has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like Citizens. Rest assured, we are working hard,
we're navigating the current turbulence well, and we're taking the actions to position us well for the medium term.
And with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter, referencing
slides 5 and 6.
For the third quarter, we generated underlying net income of $448 million and EPS of $0.89. This includes the
Private Bank start-up investment of $0.05 and a negative $0.14 impact from the Non-Core portfolio. Our
underlying ROTCE for the quarter is 12.5%.
On slide 5, you'll see that we've provided a schedule separating out our Non-Core run-off portfolio and the start-
up investment in our new Private Bank from our Legacy Core results, so you can see how those impact our
performance.
Our Legacy Core bank delivered a solid underwriting ROTCE of 15.3%. Currently, the Private Bank start-up
investment is a drag to results, but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive, 5% EPS benefit in
2025. Similarly, while Non-Core is currently a sizable drag to revenues, it will run off quickly, further bolstering our
overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forward-starting swaps.
Back to slide 6. Total net interest income was down 4% linked quarter and our margin was 3.03%, down 14 basis
points, both in line with expectations. Deposits were up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing resilience of
the franchise.
We continued our balance sheet optimization efforts, further strengthening liquidity during the quarter, given the
uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations, increasing
cash and securities by about $4 billion. In addition, the Non-Core portfolio declined by $1.4 billion and in the
quarter at $12.3 billion.
[indiscernible] (00:07:14) clarity on new liquidity rules for Category IV banks, it is worth pointing out that we
currently exceed the current LCR requirements for both Category I and Category III banks. Our period-end LDR
improved to 84%, while our credit metrics remained solid, with net charge-offs of 40 basis points, stable linked
quarter.
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $172 million and a reserve build of $19 million this quarter, increasing
our ACL coverage to 1.55%, up from 1.52% at the end of the second quarter, with the increase primarily directed
to raising the General Office portfolio reserves from 8% in 2Q to 9.5% at the end of 3Q.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
We repurchased $250 million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.4%,
up from 10.3% in the second quarter. And our tangible book value per share decreased 3% linked quarter,
reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates.
Turning to slide 7 on net interest income. Linked quarter results were down 4%, as expected, primarily reflecting a
lower net interest margin, which was down 14 basis points to 3.03%. As you can see from the walk at the bottom
of the slide, the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing, which includes mix shift from lower cost to
higher interest-bearing categories, non-interest bearing deposit migration, as well as the mixed impact of the
liquidity build I mentioned earlier. These factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and
rundown of the Non-Core portfolio.
Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 48% through 3Q, which has been rising in response to the rate
cycle and competitive environment. Our deposit franchise has performed well, with deposit betas generally in the
pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the
higher end of peers. Our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral, down slightly
versus the prior quarter.
Moving to sliding 8. Fees were down 3% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees,
partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees. The capital market's fees outlook was positive early in
September, but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up to the end of the month, we saw a number
of M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter, resulting in lower linked quarter M&A advisory fees as well as lower
bond underwriting.
While we continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines, uncertainty continues around the timing of these
deals closing, given the level of market volatility. Card fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower balance transfer
fees. The increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher MSR valuation. The servicing P&L provides a
diversifying benefit, which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production as higher mortgage rates
weighed on lock volumes,
On slide 9, we did well on expenses, keeping them broadly stable linked quarter, excluding the $35 million Private
Bank start-up investment.
On slide 10, average loans are down 2% and period-end loans are down 1% linked quarter. The Non-Core
portfolio run-off of $1.4 billion drove the overall decline, partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and
home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial
along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this
environment. Period-end core loans are sustainable.
Average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients look to deleverage given the
environment and higher rates. We saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic
environment.
Next, to slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were up $530 million linked
quarter with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits broadly stable.
Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 39 basis points, which translates to a 48% cumulative beta. Our
deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels and with 67% of our deposits in consumer
5

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
and about 70% insured/secured. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this
rising rate environment.
As rates rose in the third quarter, we saw continued migration of lower cost deposits to higher yielding categories
with non-interest bearing now representing about 22% of total deposits. This is back to pre-pandemic levels, and
we would expect the decline to moderate from here although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and
consumer behavior.
Now, moving to credit on slide 13, net charge-offs were 40 basis points, stable linked quarter with a decrease in
commercial offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto, which normalized following a very low second
quarter result.
Non-accrual loans increased 9% linked quarter to 87 basis points of total loans, reflecting an increase in General
Office. We feel the rate of increase in non-accruals is decelerating after a jump in Q2.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14, our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.55%, which is a 3-
basis-point increase from the second quarter, which reflects a reserve build of $19 million as well as the
denominator effect from the run-down of the non-core portfolio.
We increased our general office coverage to 9.5% from 8% in the second quarter. You can see some of the key
assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario
that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns.
As mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $354 million this quarter, which represents
coverage of 9.5% against the $3.7 billion portfolio. We have already taken $100 million in charge-offs in this
portfolio, which is about 2.5% of loans.
In setting the General Office reserve, we are factoring in a very severe peak-to-trough decline in office values of
about 68%, with the remaining 18% to 20% default rate and a loss severity of about 50%. So we feel the current
coverage of 9.5% is very strong. It's worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our
outlook would be manageable given our strong reserve and capital position.
We have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and
engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower-specific elements to
de-risk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. I should also note that about 99.2% of CRE General Office is
in current pay status.
Moving to slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.4% as
we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank
regulators.
We've returned a total of $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to
maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro
uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks with our size.
Turning to slide 16 and 17. I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, so
that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
First, on slide 16, we've included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving
performance over the medium term. On the commercial side, we highlight how we are positioned to support the
significant growth in Private Capital.
Although deal activity has been relatively muted recently, many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to
deploy, so there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity given the right
market conditions.
We have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've
established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor league tables. And our new private bankers will
significantly expand our sponsor relationships and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when
sponsor activity picks up.
We also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payments space and we've been investing in our Treasury
Solutions business, developing integrated payments platforms and expanding our client hedging capabilities.
On the consumer side, our entry into New York metro is going very well with some early success attracting new
customers to the bank and growing deposits about nine times faster than in our legacy branches as we leverage
our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our
network.
The buildout of the Private Bank is also going very well. These bankers have hit the ground running and have
already brought in around $500 million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half
of Q3.
This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places
where we'd like to do more like Florida and California. We plan to open a few private banking centers in these
geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with our Clarfeld legacy wealth business as the
centerpiece of that effort.
Turning to slide 17. On the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program, which is progressing well. The
chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the Non-Core portfolio, which is comprised of our $9 billion shorter
duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans.
This portfolio is expected to decline by about $7.6 billion from where we are now to about $4.7 billion at the end of
2025. And as this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of cash pay downs to building core bank liquidity,
with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio. The capital
recaptured through reduction in Non-Core RWA will be reallocated to support the growth of the Private Bank.
In summary, this strategy strengthens liquidity and has already been a source of about $3 billion of term funding
ABS issuance this year. It builds capital by reducing RWAs and it's accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE.
Next to our TOP program on the right side of the slide. Our latest program is well underway and on target to
deliver a $115 million pre-tax run rate benefit by year-end. Our TOP programs are essential to improving our
returns over the medium term, and we are ready to launch on TOP 9, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by
further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
We are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in third-party spend as well. In light of pressure
on revenue given the rate environment, we are targeting to keep 2024 underlying expenses flat.
On the technology front, we have a very extensive agenda with a multiyear next-gen tech cloud migration,
targeting the exit of all of our data centers by 2025 and a program to converge our core deposit system onto a
cloud-based modern banking platform. We've come a long way modernizing our platforms since the IPO.
And on the ESG front, we recently announced a $50 billion sustainable finance target which we plan to achieve by
2030 and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. And we are working diligently to help our clients
prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on slide 18. Our outlook incorporates the Private Bank and assumes
that the Fed hold rates steady through the end of the year. We expect NII to be down approximately 2% next
quarter, given the impact from non-interest bearing and low-cost deposits migrating to higher cost categories,
albeit at a decelerating rate more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields, Non-Core run-off and day
count.
Based on the forward curve, we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of 2023 to be approximately 50%
and to rise to a terminal level of low-50s percent before the first rate cut.
Non-interest income is expected to be up 3% to 4% with a seasonal pickup in capital markets, depending upon –
on the market environment. Non-interest expense should be broadly stable, which includes the private bank and
excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment.
Net charge-offs are expected to rise to approximately mid-40s basis points as we continue to work through the
General Office portfolio and expected further normalization.
We feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level and the ACL level will continue to benefit from
loan run-off. Our CET1 is expected to increase to approximately 10.5% with the opportunity to engage in a
modest level of share repurchases, the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the
external environment.
Beyond the 4Q 2023 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting flat 2024 underlying expenses. This
includes the Private Bank and the Non-Core portfolio and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment.
Also, we've included slide 25 in the Appendix on the swaps impact through 2027. We expect higher swap
expense in 2024 to be partly offset by the benefit to NII from the Non-Core rundown.
Notably, the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over 2025 through 2027 as swaps run off and the Fed
normalizes short rates. In addition, the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in 2026 and 2027.
To wrap up, we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment. Importantly,
we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will
serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized and if the environment becomes more challenging.
Our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as
we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Operator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.

Hi, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is for John. John, there has been a lot of feedback from investors on uncertainty over the NII
trajectory for 2024 in the environment of Higher for Longer. And I think you know where I'm going here. I think that
investors are trying to sort of square the $11 billion, $12 billion increase in notional swaps, right, at a received
fixed rate of 3.10% in the second half of next year and trying to square that in a Higher for Longer environment
with some of the balance sheet optimization.
So if you could just sort of take us through a little bit of the moving pieces and perhaps simplify it for the investors
listening in terms of how that impacts your NII trough timing. What happens after you hit trough? And are you still
confident in what you said, I guess, a month ago in that you could exit 4Q 2024 with a 3% NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Erika. Maybe I'll take that a little bit in reverse order, because it might help us with the jump off
conversation.
So net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter. So we felt good about that, at 3.03%. I think that
the two big forces that I would talk about broadly, as you look out into the fourth quarter, would be our basic
ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out. So I'd say that if you look at overall net interest
margin, I'd say that we're going to see another, call it, mid-single digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just
on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity build. And so, that 3.03% kind of comes in right around that 3%. So
that's kind of playing out the way we expect it. Notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration, I'd
say that that's holding about where we think it should be.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
The other item, as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck, is the fact that given the uncertainty
and regulatory environment, we've endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way. That
liquidity build is NII-neutral, but it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin. And so, you could see
that being an impact in the fourth quarter of – it was a couple, maybe 2 basis points or so in the third quarter. That
could be maybe another, call it, several basis points as you get into fourth quarter. So you can see things playing
out as we expect in the fourth quarter.
When you basically get to the 2024 dynamics, once you reset the table in the fourth quarter, the big puts and
takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into – it's flattish when you get into the first half of
the year, but it rises in the second half of the year. It happens that as it relates to 2024, that's about when the
forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in. So I'd say that when you think about some of
the mitigants to the outlook with the swap portfolio, you're going to have potentially the Fed beginning to cut in the
second half of 2024.
You have the ongoing benefit of the Non-Core portfolio. You've got the growing accretive contributions from the
Private Bank. And with long rates being where they are, asset front book, back book is a – kind of will contribute
positively. And then, just the broader balance sheet optimization efforts that we're doing across the bank, I think,
are all the areas that I would highlight as nice mitigants to what we're seeing play out.
And let's see where the rate environment plays out. I mean, the forwards have it in one place. We have economic
– Bloomberg economist consensus are probably 50 basis points lower than where the forwards are. But I mean,
nevertheless, we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and, frankly, growing momentum as you
exit 2024 on the net interest margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And just to clarify, are you still confident that you could exit – taking all that into account, exit 4Q 2024, have a
NIM of about 3%. And based on sort of what you're telling us, it sounds like if the Fed doesn't cut as the forward
curve indicated, that would be the risk to that 3%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think in the fourth quarter I'd say that, all else equal, we're getting around that 3% level depending upon
the impact of liquidity builds, which are NII-neutral. And as I said, liquidity build piece that I would say, which is
kind of I would say sort of set that aside, just given where we are, it doesn't drive NII. So when you're thinking
about the net interest margin that drives NII, we're going to be in that neighborhood of 3%, ex-liquidity build.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I'm going to step back after this because I think I'm taking up too much time. I just want to clarify, I'm
asking about 4Q 2024. Are you talking about for 4Q 2023? I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
4Q 2023, yeah. Sorry, I needed to make sure that was clear. Everything I was just saying was about in that last bit
was that we're getting around that 3% level, give or take, in 4Q 2023, ex-liquidity build. And the liquidity build is
NII-neutral. So if you're trying to think about where we're driving NII, it's around that plus or minus 3% level, ex-
10

liquidity build, for 2023. And all the other forces that we talked about earlier, where we're as you're going into
2024, when I was ticking off that the tailwinds from Non-Core, Private Bank asset front book, back book and BSO,
all of those are tailwinds into 2024, which will be mitigants along with let's see where the rate cuts actually start
kicking in, in the second half of 2024.
And we'll see where we exit 2024. But that's something we'll come back to you on in terms of adding more color in
January, as we typically do. And we'll assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that
time.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I want to revisit that fourth quarter margin just to make sure
everybody's on the same page. But the reported margin, it sounds like, will be below the 3%, however, right?
Because you do – and I know it will be dependent on liquidity build, but it sounds like you do anticipate liquidity
build, so we'll be talking kind of something in the mid-2.90s. Would that be sort of the reported expectation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
It will be lower. It just depends on the NII-neutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate. So it's sort of
− I think it's useful to talk about it ex-liquidity build given the fact that that's the driver of NII and there'll be possibly
additional, just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded, it'll be – that's flat to NII but it will be a
denominator effect that would take the NIM below that plus or minus 3% that I talked about before, but not an NII
driver.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then maybe as we look out, just in terms of sort of the handoff from the non-
core loan run-off to more visible Private Bank growth. When do we sort of think that will become sort of more
neutral from in terms of visibility to the balance sheet, like when would we expect the loan portfolio to sort of level
out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that we were saying that we think that the Non-Core run-off will be a continued driver of sort of – in
the first half of − in 4Q and the first half of 2024 you'll see some declines in the loan portfolio. But in the second
half of 2024, we start seeing the Private Bank contributing as well as organic contribution and starting to see loan
growth such that year-over-year we would have an expectation, you'd see us starting to see loan growth in the
second half of 2024.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thank you. Just I was wondering on the credit side, we've just seen in general some preannouncements on
charge-offs in the shared national credit space. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to share of national
credits and how you fared in the recent exam?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So let me take that, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So just in general as I think of – there's a lot of focus on shared national credits. Actually, when we came through
the exam this year we had more upgrades than we had downgrades, so we didn't have any forced charge-offs in
terms of our the shared national credit book.
We've been taking our participations down as part of our BSO exercise. We're there about 10% lower than they
were a couple of quarters ago. I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credit. We treat participations or
shared national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension.
So, one, it has to return. People think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning. We
go through the exact same process whether we're participating or leaving a transaction or a sole lender. And then
also, we do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make, whether it be a shared national credit
extension or not.
So, our SNC book doesn't perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank. And actually, in some
cases, it's larger credits. So they might perform marginally better than some of the middle-market assets that we
have on the book over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I think just as part of the BSO as Bruce said, as part of BSO in general, we're kind of looking at the
total relationship returns. And if we went into a credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and
become more important bank that's not panning out, we're not getting the cross-sell we anticipated, and we're
extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity. So I think you'll continue to see that trend.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me just pick up on that. Just in the last quarter, back to the loan growth question, we had about $900
million of front book loan originations offset by about $1.6 billion of BSO activity. So we're really churning the book
towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that Bruce mentioned. And I think a
lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing. We see people supporting their lead bank relationships and
moving away from more speculative future opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And then just – can you just provide a little bit more color maybe on the deposit repricing and
migration and how you see it playing out with a longer – Higher for Longer rates just impacting the deposit pricing
pressures?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and handle that. I mean, I think, first off, I mean, I think when you look at our performance from
a deposit beta standpoint, we feel like we're basically in the pack with what you're seeing across the industry,
which is a really positive result compared to where we were last cycle. It's just part of the ongoing investments
we've been making in primacy and product capabilities and delivering the entire banks for our customers. So
we're really kind of pleased to see where we're – how things are playing out cycle to date.
That said, we still are. And frankly, you look at the overall metric of non-interest bearing to overall deposits, we're
around 22%. That's basically back to where we were pre-pandemic. We've seen a decelerating migration out of
non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing, and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interest-bearing
book.
Nevertheless, it's getting smaller every quarter. We would expect to see that really dissipating over the coming
quarter or two. And that's really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the Fed's on hold. So, feeling
very good about that trajectory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe, Brendan, you track very carefully how we're doing versus peers and some of our strategy is to
continue to maintain that low-cost focus. So maybe you could add some additional color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sounds good. So much of our low-cost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed
through the pandemic by all the stimulus. We saw the rundown of the stimulus rate peak in May and it started to
abate as we got into the summer and the fall, although it's still kind of spending down at a decent clip.
We do have a lot of analytics, benchmarking analytics and how we're doing, and this is supportive of John's
commentary that the franchise is performing at a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle. We believe
we're number two in the peer set in terms of DDA consumer migration. So we're performing exceptionally well on
the DDA side.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
When you look at beta on the consumer side as compared with the growth that we're getting, it appears we're
about 400 to 500 basis points better in net growth on the consumer book through the cycle so far and our betas
are mildly better.
So, more growth, slightly better cost on the core book, that's excluding Citizens Access. That's a real indicator of
the quality of the franchise and the quality of the customer base that we've moved from sort of a community
banking, high-priced deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships.
So we expect the paydown of low-cost deposits to continue to slow obviously depending on rate environment and
the economy that potentially could change. But I do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to
peers will be strong and we'll continue to outperform on the consumer side on the stability of our low-cost book.
At the individual customer level, they still have a little bit more liquidity in their balances than they did pre-
pandemic. That's largely held by affluent and high-net-worth individuals. Our mass market book and even in the
mass affluent space, they've sort of moderated back down to operating floors. So I think those are all signs that
would support a continued slowdown in the rundown of low-cost deposits pending any recessionary impact that
may bring them below operating floor.
So we feel pretty good. And just on the uninsured and insured deposit front, we saw a little bit of a blip on the
uninsured in March. And since March, that has been incredibly stable and all parts of the book have been
growing. So all the fundamentals point to continued trajectory and stability and certainly continue to outperform.
And then in addition to that, you know, we're controlling what we can control. We're performing in the top quartile
in the United States in terms of household acquisition growth. The New York market, as John pointed out, is
helping to give us an extra lever to drive low-cost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends, which
are generally outperforming. So we do believe we've got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to
continue to outperform in the medium-term outlook on a low-cost deposits.

Peter J. Winter Q

Great. Very helpful. And then, just one quick housekeeping. I just want to confirm, John, you said that the

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that last question, Don. I just wanted to ask you. I know that the
Private Bank buildout was $35 million of costs this quarter. Just wondering if there's any changes to your
expectation of what that would trend like going forward as part of that cost commentary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think Brendan will probably add some color on this, but it's pretty similar into the fourth quarter. And then, of
course, into next year, you see it starting to migrate towards a – instead of being an EPS drag, it gets back to
breakeven when you get out into 2024. And then more broadly, a 5% contribution to EPS is our outlook there but
go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There'll be, into Q4, some very modest upticks, in the low-40s potentially. And the reasons for that we hired
the majority of the team, as you all know, in the early part of the summer, the influences on that nudging up is our
successful securing of various different private banking offices coast to coast to house the team and start to bring
in customers into the platform. Some operating expenses clients come on board as well as we're playing some
very selective second-tier offense. There's still a lot of talent in motion. And this quarter after the first 150, we also
hired another 25 really top A-list talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer.
And so we're going to be selective. But as we see the right talent pop up, we're going to grab them and add them
to the team, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
But the other thing, just in the way that comp is structured, Ken, that the folks who came over on guarantees as if
they're fully producing. So as the revenues come in, there won't be incremental costs. There'll just be kind of
earning those pay levels. So another factor to consider.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's a great point. And then as a follow-up, you guys have done a great job over the years on the TOP
program. And just, I take your commentary about holding costs flat, inclusive of these extra builds. That would
imply a real turn exiting the year, given that you're ramped through the year on costs this year.
And John, I know you mentioned AI as a piece of that increment, but you've done 100-plus of TOP each year. I'm
just wondering, like, where else would you be digging in in across the organization to get that magnitude of what
seems to be a pretty meaningful implied extra cost save out of the numbers next year? Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So it's Bruce, and let me just start off and then John can amplify. But the TOP program, I think has been a
real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage, but to actually get to flat for next
year, we have to go beyond that.
15


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
So we've geared up a very nice TOP program and we're adding to it. But I think we're going to have to look at kind
of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks. And we'll look at certain business activities
that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically.
We've already done some of that this year, so we've downsized the mortgage business quite a bit. We exited the
auto business. So I think it's a combination of actions. It's continuing to find ways to upsize TOP, leverage things
like AI where we can do that, look at our overall org structure and staffing levels and see if we can pinch some
efficiencies there, and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where.
The key here is not to just have a knee-jerk revenues – there's revenue pressure in the environment. So let's
really take a hard knife at all expenses. We have to be judicious about where we're cutting and protect the things
that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term. So things like the private banks,
things like the New York metro expansion, there's things that we're going to ring-fence and then there's other
areas we're going to have to go a little harder with the knife. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that that covered it well, Bruce. And just the ongoing fundamentals, our bread and butter, of focusing
on organizational related items and third-party spend and the like. And I won't repeat all the categories that Bruce
articulated, but we've got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out
with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. You have 67% of deposits from consumer, so strong franchise there, and you noted that you
should outperform peers on a relative basis. But one of your large peers noted last week that banks may still be
overearning on NII. So I guess my question was, how do you see competitive factors playing out for consumer
deposits next year, especially if the rate environment stays Higher for Longer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Brendan, do you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits. You're seeing kind of money
market and CD rates in the mid-5s in some spots. We feel like we're competing really, really well on that.
Obviously, it's supported by our transformation on low cost. That's where you kind of start on how you manage
strong NII levels and NIM levels is having a solid foundation of low-cost, highly engaged customers.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
We have probably more levers than other have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up
coming our way in 2024. Certainly, we have Citizens Access, which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to
grow interest-bearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships. But also, it helps not put too much
contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may
drive in hot money and bring the franchise into non-relationship-based banking. And so, that's been an incredibly
effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interest-bearing costs.
Where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates, we've done it in an
incredibly relationship-based way. So the access into – no pun intended with Citizens Access, access into higher
rates on deposits, if you're a core banking customer of ours, requires you to be in a relationship product. We call it
Quest or Private Client, which is mass affluent or affluent value proposition. So when you do more with us, you
get more.
That strategy has enabled us to be more targeted on how we think about introducing interest-bearing cost into the
environment that we're able to protect and retain balances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire
book in some spots.
So yeah, it's intense out there. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of
hard to come by to the US banking system. But we think we got the right tools and the right levers to continue to
win and compete well with our peers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And just maybe just to add – all great points there, and just to add one other point about this. I mean, the rate
environment is expected to become more constructive, I guess, is the point. Meaning, if you're raising deposits in
a world where the yield curve is inverted or, at best, getting less inverted, that's always going to be a tricky
situation for banks until it becomes a more stable upward slopping situation, which I think it's a little more likely to
be the case as you get into 2024; and certainly, to the end of 2024, when you start seeing lower short-term rates
and, nevertheless, an attractive long-term rate, where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive
return. So that's really what I think is going to shake out as you get into 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I mean other – one last piece of color I would add is that as we enter 2024, we're still kind of having a net loan
shrink, and that'll eventually turn around as the private banks starts to put on loans. And we'll see where the
economy is. But we're not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans. We can still see the LDR
improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit. So factoring that into the calculus of do
you really need to be aggressive, given that's your dynamic around loans and deposits, that helps you manage
the cost of your deposit franchise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I appreciate all the color there. And just separately on the LCR requirements, you mentioned
that you're compliant in both Category I and Category III now, and that this bill is also NII-neutral. But I guess the
question is how much more do you think you need to build from here and how do you think about that increasing
your asset sensitivity in the long run?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I – there's just a couple of questions in there. I mean, I think the regulatory requirements are
generally inducing banks to become more asset-sensitive. You've got the issue of, more broadly, if the long-term
debt rule goes in, that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration that's going to cause
asset-sensitivity to grow over time.
We're naturally an asset-sensitive bank, and those forces would cause us to be more asset-sensitive. So we'll
have to consider in the coming – and during the transition periods whether it makes sense to moderate those
positions with off-balance sheet types of actions. But nevertheless, there's generally a tailwind of asset-sensitivity
being created from the regulatory environment, but also idiosyncratic to us, our non-core portfolio, as that runs off.
That's mostly a fixed book and that has a tailwind to asset-sensitivity.
We're around neutral now. So becoming a bit more asset-sensitive over time is some of the underlying forces
there that I would say are in place. And we'll decide as the environment plays out whether – how and whether to
moderate that.
And again, the liquidity build is NII-neutral. So it's really not a driver. And it's something that, again, at the NII
guide of down 2% is really driven by basically having a – the ex-liquidity build NIM decline is really the driver of
that and equates to the 2% that you're seeing in the guide. So that's the way to pull it all together for 4Q.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Connor (sic) [Matt O'Connor] from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I want to talk earlier in the call in terms of non-interest income trajectory for next year and all the
puts and takes. But I just want to circle back on that. In a sustainable rate environment, so kind of Higher for
Longer, when and around what level does the net interest income dollars start to bottom?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, we're still working through our 2024 outlooks, right? So we're going to be much more, I would say,
transparent about what our expectations are for 2024 as you get into planning season here and completing that.
And of course, we do that in January.
With that said, we, broadly, as you look at the swap trajectory for us into 2024, we have a swap portfolio growing
right around the time that the forwards would indicate the Fed would begin to cut. And matter of fact, as I
mentioned earlier, there's – you could actually see deviation around that and we happen to have a view that is
likely – that it'll actually come in a little lower than where the forwards had it coming in at the end of 2024.
18


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
So that'll be a mitigant. And as I mentioned, the Non-Core rundown is a mitigant and Private Bank as that grows is
of course, accretive.
The other thing I'll mention, I mean, if you get beyond 2024 and you look at what's happening in the 2025 through
2027 timeframes, it's certainly more consistent with a more neutral Fed posture. That would represent –
regardless of what the transition is in 2024 that would represent a significant tailwind getting into 2025 to 2027 as
you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and NII.
And so working our way through 2024, we get some really nice tailwinds and that's just on the active swap
portfolio. We also have a locked-in and baked-in tailwind from the terminated swaps, which run off as you can see
on our slide in a significant way over 2025 to 2027.
So I would call 2024 a transition year while the Fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes
hold with Non-Core and creates this – create a lot of momentum as you look out into 2025 and beyond.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add a little color here, Matt, to you and Erika's question. I think Erika was looking for John to
say, are you still holding at 3% in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year. I think the
reluctance to draw a line in the sand on 3% is the amount of the liquidity build. And that – some of the cards from
the regulators on new liquidity regulation aren't turned over yet.
So just putting that aside if you just say, that's a bit of an unknown. Do we still have an ambition to have our exit
rate at the end of 2023 be roughly the exit rate at the end of 2024? Yeah, that would still be the ambition. We
have to go through the work as John said, to go through kind of the budget process for next year, but that's still
where we'd be hoping to arrive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just in terms of the impact of rate cuts versus higher-for-longer scenario, what does higher-for-longer do
versus the rate cuts? Because it sounds like you're still a little asset sensitive, but the roll-on of the swaps would
obviously benefit from rate cuts. So what's the net impact if rates are stable versus what the forward curve has for
next year? Is it better or worse?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say, I'd say that where we're positioned, yeah, we're right around neutral. A small increase in rates
is actually positive to our platform. A large – we tend to calculate the stuff using the 100-basis-point and 200-
basis-point gradual rises were relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations which you'll see disclosures on in
our 10-Q.
But when it comes to just another hike or – and those kinds of conversations, meaning we tend to, in those
environments, continue to make money and have a positive impact to NII.
The other way – so generally the forward curve is favorable to us. I think we like the tracking of the forward curve.
We start getting cuts at the end of 2024 and that allows the continued front book, back book. We like the long end
19


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
being more anchored a little higher. That helps, too, in terms of our originations at our fixed rate loan book. So
again – and it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that that's desirable.
So the forward curve is, I think, constructive for us, plus or minus is fine. I think large moves either way is where
we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds. But other than that, we're feeling – we feel okay with
it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. So to summarize, steeper is better as a good rule of thumb.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'd say forward curve is better and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much. So having some cuts
and a slow – I mean, in general, over the long term, banks do better. We're maturity intermediary when rate –
when we have an upward sloping yield curve.
So the short rates are at 5.50%. We think that that it's more constructive to see short rates around 3% to 3.50%
over the long term. We also think it's constructive to have 10-year that's north of 4% in that same environment.
So, therefore, a gradual decline from 5.50% down to about 3% to 3.50% over the next two years we think is not
only good for us but good for the industry and allow us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve and I think
that that's the environment where we would be performing in a very good way.
That said, we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that, but that's
the one that I would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole.

Hi. Thanks. I guess I have a couple of clarifications, given all the discussions going on. John, when you said –

Non-Core is not included in the way you define underlying expenses. So are you saying both underlying, which is

It includes those things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

Okay. So I want to – but all these definitions, everybody has a little difference. So it's important to clarify that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.

Thank you. The second one, I guess, John, going back to the rates discussion, just trying to get my head wrapped
around that. If I heard you right just in response to Matt's question, you said small increase in rates is beneficial to
NII, but then rate cuts is also positive. So I'm trying to reconcile how both scenarios are positive for you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I can clarify that, Vivek. I mean, a small increase in rates from here would drive some NII, a small amount
of NII. And a small decline would be a small – negative event in terms of a small decline in NII. But they're both
quite small, which is why we're calling ourselves neutral. But just from a positioning standpoint, it would be a small
positive if rates rose from here and with, let's say, one additional hike, for example.
Let's say that if the Fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in November or December, we'll see an NII contribution to
that. A small cut goes the other way and also – but not a significant decline if there was a cut.

Thank you.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And to be clear, the difference here is what happens immediately, say, in the next quarter versus what
happens over time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
We are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to
3% to 3.5% over call it, a orderly period of time.
We think that's very good and it gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book, back books
continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next, call it, year or two
as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with non-core run-off, etcetera.
So we would – our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that will migrate to over the,
call it the 2024 and early 2025 period.

And one more clarification – that's helpful – on the expenses. Bruce, when you talk about stable for next year,
what are you assuming for capital markets? Are you assuming for capital markets revenues and, therefore,
incentive comp goes up or are you just using current level? Any color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Well, we haven't given the full guidance yet on 2024, but there is a variable element of pay that if revenues
go up in capital markets, that pay would go up. That's probably the one area that has the greatest tie to revenues
across the bank, and we would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process.
So, we said we're targeting the flat expenses for next year and we would incorporate our view on kind of where
the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that. And then we'd
have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank.
