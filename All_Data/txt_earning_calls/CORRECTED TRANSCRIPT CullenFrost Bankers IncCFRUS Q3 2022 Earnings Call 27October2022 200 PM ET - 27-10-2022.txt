Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B., and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today I'll review third quarter results for
Cullen/Frost, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas is going to provide additional comments before we
open it up to your questions.
In third quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $168.1 million or $2.59 a share and that compared with earnings of $106.3
million or a $1.65 a share reported in the same quarter last year, and $117.4 million or $1.81 a share in the
second quarter of this year. Our return on average assets and average common equity in the third quarter were
1.27% and 20.13% respectively. These results and our overall growth show that our investments in our strategy of
sustainable organic growth are paying off and that our company is well positioned to succeed.
Loan growth continue to be strong and above our long-term expectation of high-single digits annual growth.
Average loans excluding PPP in the third quarter were $16.75 billion or 13% higher level than the average loans
of $14.82 billion in the third quarter of 2021. On an annualized linked-quarter basis, loans excluding PPP
increased by little over 5%. Year-over-year growth in the portfolio was broad-based with about third coming from
our C&I component, about half coming from commercial real estate, and the remainder coming from consumer
real estate.
We booked about $2.04 billion in new commercial commitments in the third quarter, and this was up 12% from a
year ago and down 7% from the second quarter. The drop was mainly from larger deals as core commitments
were more in line with the previous quarter. Looking at our pipeline, gross pipeline is basically flat from the last
quarter, down 0.9% and on a weighted basis, it's down 15%. Overall, deposit growth was strong and we invested
in our depositor relationships by doing the right thing and allowing increased interest rates to flow through to our
customers.
Average deposits in the third quarter were $45.8 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of last
year and up 9.6% on an annualized basis over the previous quarter. We continue to see great growth in our
consumer banking business. Average consumer loans were $2.1 billion in the third quarter, up by 15.9% over the
third quarter last year and up an un-annualized 6.9% compared to the previous quarter. This is primarily from our
consumer real estate products of HELOC, home equity, and home improvement. The outlook for these loans
continues to be good and credit strong.
Growth in new households continues. In the third quarter, we put on 6,773 new households. That was 4% higher
than the same quarter a year ago. Our total household count of over 405,000 in the third quarter was 7.1% over
the record level in 2021, all organic. Regarding our branch expansion efforts, our Houston expansion branches
have produced right at $1 billion of deposits with loans of $765 million and over 18,000 new households. And they
continue to exceed pro forma.
In Dallas, we opened the sixth of our planned new locations earlier this month, and we expect to open four more
new locations before the end of this year. We are very encouraged by the preliminary results of the new sites
which have achieved 356% of deposit goals, 290% of loan goals, and 250% of new household goals. Now, before
anyone asks, yes, we did set meaningful goals for our new locations. As we said before, those goals are based
on the average of what we had achieved with the 40 locations that we had opened in the eight years prior to our
Houston expansion strategy.
As I mentioned, the new Houston locations are above goal and the new Dallas branches are performing even
better than that. Our team that is building our new mortgage loan process is preparing to launch its pilot program,

with an eye on rolling out our new mortgage loans on a wider basis in stages beginning late this year and early
next year. It has been exciting to watch as we create an entire process to originate and service mortgage loans in
keeping with the Frost philosophy and our core values of integrity, caring and excellence.
Overall, credit quality remains good. The September 30 number for total delinquencies excluding PPP was $80.5
million or 48 basis points of total loans. The total problem loan level, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher,
totaled $387 million at the end of the third quarter, down from $429 million at the end of the second quarter. The
favorable rate of problem resolutions that we began seeing late last year via payoffs, payments and upgrades
continued to the third quarter totaling $381 million to-date. Once again, we did not report a credit loss expense in
the third quarter, and net charge-offs for the quarter were $2.9 million, which compares favorably with the $2.8
million in the second quarter. Annualized net charge-offs for the third quarter remained at 7 basis points of
average loans, which is below our typical long-term level. Non-accrual loans were $29.9 million at the end of the
third quarter and that represented a decrease from $35.1 million at the end of the second quarter.
You may remember that in our second quarter conference call, I reported that we had achieved our goal of mid-
single digit concentration level in the energy portfolio, and I'm happy to report that we've stuck to our goal with
energy loans excluding PPP representing 5.4% of loans at the end of the third quarter. And speaking of PPP
loans, we knew that when that process began, helping our customers get their loans forgiven would be as
important as helping them get their applications approved, and our teams have done a magnificent job on both
ends of the process and more than 99% of our borrowers are through the process now. And the way that we help
borrowers get emergency loans to stay in business and then get through the PPP forgiveness process is going to
pay dividends for our customer relationships for many, many years. All of this together demonstrates that we have
strategies and systems in place to allow us to succeed in all economic environments. We believe in doing the
right thing for our customers. And it isn't just words. It's backed up by the investments in time, resources and
personnel that we make with things like our industry-leading rates on deposit accounts, building a world-class
mortgage loan process from start to finish, providing overdraft grace, early payday, 24-hour customer assistance
7 days a week, and expanding our presence so that we can extend the Frost value proposition to people across
Texas. All that takes hard work. And I'd like to thank our people for being a force for good in everyday lives.
And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter
was 3.01%, up 45 basis points from the 2.56% reported last quarter. Our yields on both balances held at the Fed
and loans had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage. The increase was also positively
impacted to a much lesser extent by higher yields on investment securities and by higher volumes of both
investment securities and loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs on deposits and
repurchase agreements.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $19.4 billion during the third quarter,
up $1.3 billion from the second quarter average, as we continued to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the
quarter. We made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately $2.2 billion, which included about
$790 million in Treasuries, yielding about a 3.15%, $840 million in agency MBS securities with a yield of about
4.62%, and about $520 million in municipal securities with the taxable equivalent yield of about 4.85%.
Our current expectation is that we would invest an additional $1.2 billion of our excess liquidity into investment
purchases in the fourth quarter or about $1 billion net of projected inflows. The taxable equivalent yield on the
4

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
total investment portfolio was 2.94% in the third quarter, up 7 basis points from the second quarter. The taxable
portfolio, which averaged $11.5 billion, up $1.2 billion from the prior quarter, had a yield of 2.20%, up 16 basis
points from the prior quarter.
Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $7.9 billion during the third quarter, up about $113 million from
the second quarter, and had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. At the
end of the third quarter, approximately 76% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF-insured. The
duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was 5.3 years, down from 5.6 years at the end
of the second quarter.
Looking at deposits on a linked-quarter basis, average deposits were up $1.1 billion or 9.6% on an annualized
basis. Average total non-interest bearing deposits were up $156 million or 3.4% on an annualized basis from the
second quarter. Excluding public funds, those deposits would have been up $250 million or 5.6% on an
annualized basis. The linked-quarter growth in deposits has come primarily from growth in average interest-
bearing deposits, which were up $921 million or 14% on an annualized basis. The cost of interest-bearing
deposits for the quarter was 62 basis points, up 40 basis points from the second quarter.
Looking at non-interest income on a linked-quarter basis, service charges on deposit accounts were down
$910,000 or 3.8%, primarily as a result of lower commercial service charges, primarily resulting from a higher
earnings credit rate on annualized balances. Insurance commissions and fees were up $1.4 million or 11.7% from
the second quarter as a result of higher life insurance commissions, which were up $600,000 and also impacted
by our normal business cycle, which results in higher commissions on both P&C and group benefits in the third
quarter versus the second.
Other charges, commissions and fees were up $1.2 million or 12.2% from the second quarter. Commitment fees
on unused lines of credit and money market income were both up over $500,000 compared to the second quarter.
Regarding total non-interest expenses, total non-interest expense was up $11.6 million or 4.7% compared to the
second quarter. The primary driver was salaries and wages up $10.3 million or 8.8%, primarily impacted by higher
crude incentives and an increase in the number of employees as we continue to grow our business, and to a
lesser extent, the impact of market increases which were effective in May.
Looking at our projection of full-year total non-interest expenses, we now expect total non-interest expense for the
full-year 2022 to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens over our 2021 reported levels. The effective tax
rate for the third quarter was 14%. And our current expectation is that our full-year effective tax rate should be in
the range of about 13% to 14%, but that can be affected by discrete items during the remainder of the year.
Regarding the estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022 earnings, our current projections include a 75 basis point
Fed rate increase in November, followed by a 50 basis point increase in December. Given those rate
assumptions, we currently believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter of $2.50 is
too low, and we believe that even the highest estimate that I see as $2.72 for the fourth quarter is low.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.
Please proceed.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hi, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start, so Frost is one of the few banks that saw growth of non-interest bearing deposits in the quarter.
Could you give more color on what drove that? You are not seeing the same underlying trend most banks are
seeing where they're seeing outflows into higher-yielding alternatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Steven, if you remember the last quarter I said one of my concerns was that we might see some
softness there. Now I'm going to say I continue to be somewhat concerned, especially about the larger balances.
We're seeing some movement there, but so far have been able to offset that sort of reduction in balances. So,
knock on wood, I think we – in our projections, part of our beat was that we had more liquidity than we expected,
part of it being from deposits being stronger. So, I think that we continue to analyze those. I think there is still a
little bit of risk, especially on those higher balances accounts, but I think, as Phil mentioned, our goal is to try to
continue to provide top quality service. We continue to build new relationships. So we're obviously adding
deposits there.
When we look back at kind of the 12-month, look back at what our deposits, where that growth is coming from,
about 55% of it is from augmentation of our existing customers, but 45% of the growth was coming from new
customers. So, I think it's a good place to be, but I continue to be concerned, especially like I said about those
higher balance customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. I'm hoping we could drill a little bit, I got many questions on the AOCI mark and the TCE ratio
falling below 4%. Can you talk about where do you see that bottoming? And when you look at the securities
6

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
payoff schedule, what's the timing when we should start to see tangible book and TCE ratio start to turn up given
the payoff schedule?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think obviously most of that is going to be driven by what happens with interest rates more than payoffs, to be
quite honest with you. If you believe kind of what the Fed is saying about interest rates starting to decline in the
next year or two, if you will, I think you'll see some of that come back. We're aware of what's out there from a TCE
basis. We are moving our new muni purchases to the held to maturity category. We're not doing a lot there, but
we're sensitive to it. We don't spend a lot of time, to be quite honest with you, worrying about it, with liquidity at – I
think this morning we were still north of $12 billion, we've got a loan to deposit ratio that's pretty low. So we're not
in the same situation as other banks are. So, it's something that we're aware of, but don't really spend a lot of time
worrying about it. We may do some things with new purchases, but to the extent of what we're discussing, that's
really about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Steven, from a business point of view, again, notwithstanding a situation where somebody would have
to monetize those unrealized losses and that would really be a situation, I think we had a liquidity issue or
something like that. And that's not it – that's not on our radar, obviously, in terms of – because of so much liquidity
we have, now, I am a Frost banker and liquidity is always on my radar. So I will say that. But the economic reality
is, if you run a business, to me, and I think this is one of the things that the Fed considered when they changed
those rules several years ago about this mark-to-market is there are tremendous natural hedges that exist in the
balance sheets of regional banks with their non-maturity deposit bases, and the accounting industry doesn't even
try to recognize those values. And I think as you look at how balances and net interest margins operate, where
banks have these natural hedges, I think from an economic standpoint, it's not something that is of concern to us.
That said, I recognize that if a bank doesn't have liquidity to hold these things, then they might be in a different
situation, but it's not keeping us up at night.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steven, just to give you a little bit of color to answer your question specifically on 2023, right now, I'm projecting
about $1.4 billion in maturities and payoffs. And as you go into 2024 and such, the munis really start to
accelerate. We're only expecting about $400 million next year, but after that you're probably in the range of $1.2
billion to $1.3 billion for the next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay, thanks. And if I could sneak one more in, so the backdrop of what we're hearing this quarter is
most banks are only raising the rates on deposits basically when they're forced to fund loan growth. What's been
the customer reception in your markets like at the ground level to you guys offering higher rates? Are you seeing
a material acceleration of client acquisition because of that? Thanks.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
What I would say about client acquisition that it's continued to stay. I was looking at our retail numbers recently,
and I think I might have said that our retail numbers were up by 7.1% in terms of total customer numbers. And
then we also saw an increase of 4% from the third quarter of 2021 in terms of the net new customers that we had.
So those were really record numbers in 2021. I don't know if you remember, I think we beat our all-time high
before that year by 210%. So that's kept up. And I think we've continued to see growth, as you said earlier, in
deposits. And I believe we're seeing some more growth in the interest-bearing deposits as opposed to non-
interest bearing [indiscernible] (23:26)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, correct, correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...total. So I think it's reflecting in those numbers and the character of the deposits that we're raising. I think it's
been understood by people in the marketplace. We're trying to make it better understood by improving our
marketing. I think we could do a better job there, and we're hard at work trying to do that, we will do that. And you
know, Steven, it's I don't think we've been defensive in these races. I think what our attitude has been, it's more
offensive than it is defensive. And so if you see increases in our deposit betas, it's because we've got the ability to
do it. We've got the operating leverage to do it. We are making that investment in those customers. And I think it
just makes our franchise stronger and the trust factor greater. So, that's what you're seeing today when you see
those betas. It's not really a factor of we're worried, it's that this is kind of our time and we really want to be – we
don't want to be asleep at the switch. We want to continue to be putting on the pressure and increasing market
share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, one last thing I'll say and it's really tough to analyze, but it's not like we're saying from the work that we've
done, significant percentages of those deposits. If you're looking at the growth in MMA, for example, it's not that
money is coming out of our DDA or IOC accounts. So, maybe 10% or 15% of the increase is some
disintermediation between our own non-interest-bearing to our interest bearing. So it's not like we're seeing big
percentages of movements there.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Was wondering if you could just give an update on your NII expectations following the stronger trends this quarter,
and if you could just talk about how you're thinking about NIM trajectory into 4Q and the beginning of next year, if
you think you'll still have some solid expansion opportunity to go there, that'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Dave, I'll speak in generalities. As I said, we're still assuming that the next, whatever it is, five days or such,
the Fed is going to raise rates 75 basis points and then again 50 bps in December. So with that sort of a
trajectory, I certainly would expect that our NIM and our net interest income will both increase into fourth quarter.
We don't give guidance on 2023 until January, but I'll say that given what we're seeing, I don't see – without some
dramatic change in redemption rates, if you will, I don't see the fourth quarter being the peak on the NIM. I don't
expect the same sort of growth in the NIM percentage or dollars that we had between third and fourth – excuse
me, second and third to occur, third and fourth and going forward. But I do expect, from a trend standpoint, that
those would continue to improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. I think you talked about at least being up over the low-20s in NII this year. Seems like
that should go decently higher, what do you guys thinking there now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I would say so. I think that you'll just see that if you guys kind of put that out their trajectory-wise, you're
going to see that, that – you know, if I'm giving you guidance that I would expect the fourth quarter to increase, it
really blows that low-20% growth out of the water.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. And then, how are you guys thinking about deposit beta through the cycle at this
point? I think you'd mentioned, getting a 20% total deposit beta through 2022, you're expecting 75 and 50 bps
coming up here, how are you just thinking about that through the cycle now?

We really haven't changed our thought processes very much there. I mean, I think we're kind of on the same
place. We may be a little bit light right now, not much. But as I look at 2022 right now, that's kind of what we're
expecting that we'll be doing through the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. Maybe just switching to deposits, great growth this quarter, it was great to see really buck the trend
for the industry as you guys talked about before. I was curious what the contribution was from Houston and
Dallas. I know you mentioned the $1 billion mark for Houston, congrats on that. Just curious that if you had the
starting and finishing balances for both of those markets, that'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, the one thing I do remember, top of mind, I'll just quote that right now, because I think Phil mentioned the
year-over-year growth in deposits, so I think the – if you look at, I think we reported 17% growth year-over-year.
And I think without the expansion, we would have been at 16%. And then if you look at the loan side, I think that
they actually provided loans [indiscernible] (28:41). Let me see if I've got it here. They've had provided 2% of the
growth in that category. So I think we were up. And this is excluding PPP, obviously. If you excluded PPP, we
were up 13%. And I think the expansion provide a little over 2% of that growth. So we would have been in the
11% range without – as far as the numbers period end, I don't think I've got those. Well, I can give them to you
here pretty quickly, you know, from a deposit standpoint, we're close to $1 billion as Phil said.

On the – back on the deposit side, deposit growth overall came in better than expected this quarter. And then we
gave some good color on the non-interest bearing dynamics. As you look at fourth quarter and into 2023, how are
you thinking about positive growth trajectory from here? What level of growth do you think is achievable as you're
looking into 2023 specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I guess, what I would say is that, if I looked at the linked-quarter growth, if I remember correctly here, and I'll
just grab that, you know, I think that we've been saying that we expect it to get softer and it has gotten softer. The
linked-quarter growth was an annualized 10%. If I look at year ago quarter, we're closer to 17%. So we are seeing
softness obviously compared to where we had been historically. I think the expansion is obviously helping. I think
that our deposit rates are obviously contributing to that as well. But I'll continue to say that, especially for larger
customers, there's just going to be more options out there, for customers with higher balances that we won't be
able to compete with and may not want to compete with, right, because there are going to be some rates that
don't make sense for us to pay.
So I would think that, if I was looking at it, I would think that I'd lean a little bit more towards the linked-quarter
growth and maybe even a little softer there. But, again, we were wrong in the third quarter, it was a lot stronger
than we expected. But I think the second and third linked-quarter growth is kind of would be my starting point, all
things being equal.

Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jerry. That's helpful. And then on the efficiency side, your efficiency ratio, clearly given
some of your top line trends, came in better than expected this quarter as well, I guess, in the 54% range on a
core basis, how do you see that trending as you look at 2023? What do you think is a reasonable longer-term
level particularly for 2023? And then separately comp expense came in a little higher this quarter. How much of
that was revenue-driven versus head count or branch investment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I would say with regard to efficiency, and I know Jerry gets uncomfortable providing guidance for 2023,
because we just don't do it until our January calls. So you guys are getting a little bit more than you would have
normally got anyway. But I will say that, look, earnings are good. I mean, a certain amount of this is arithmetic,
okay, and it's you guess earning asset, you see the NIM, you can see the impact that the increase in rates has. I
mean, that's not hard to figure out. And you guys have been doing it – John, I know you've been doing it for a
11

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
long, long time. So we expect to see the revenue piece increase. I think that bodes well for efficiency ratios. At the
same time, the reason I jumped in is that we're going to continue invest in the business. And I'm not and we aren't
obsessing over that ratio, we're going to continue to invest in, I'd say at least three things – I'd say four really right
now. One, we're going to invest in our people, and we've been doing that using the numbers on salaries we report
and then they're pretty dramatic, and they're necessary in order to keep the best group of people here and bring
new ones in. So, there's that.
We're going to invest in technology. We've been doing a lot of that and we've been getting better, and our
technology is improving all the time, and the customer experience related to it is great. We're going to continue to
invest in our physical footprint in the markets that we've decided and then we've disclosed. And we'll look at other
markets as we continue to move forward. And the other thing that we're going to do is we're going to invest in our
marketing. I think you know we need to have – with the value propositions we've got, we need to make sure our
voice is as loud as it should be in the marketplace. And so, now those things are going to continue to be
investments. And that will be on top of just any inflationary pressures. So, what we're really looking to do, as Jerry
and I look at the business is, expand it, grow it profitably, make it stronger. And so the efficiency ratio will be I
think a derivative of all that together.

It looks like the last three quarters you've been growing bonds on a net basis pretty consistently a little around like
$1 billion, maybe a little on top of $1 billion per quarter. Sounds like that's going to be the same in the fourth
quarter. Frost still has a lot of cash as a percentage of average earning assets. So, does it seem like as we look
to next year, the bond additions should be potentially about the same where you add about $1 billion a quarter
next year?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think, Brady, it's kind of funny, Phil says. I was getting Phil over here because he said that I was giving more sort
of 2023 sort of visual, if you will, forward-looking. I said, yeah, more than the former CFO, [ph] you would say that
(35:50) – what I would say is that, you know, that's a good starting point. That's what I would do if I were you. Part
of our sensitivity, obviously, about giving too much guidance is we're still in that planning process. It's
communications we're still having internally. You heard us talking a little bit about our liquidity when we got asked
the question about tangible capital. So, we want to think about all those things, and take a look also again of, you
know, make sure that we're comfortable with sort of a prepayment and maturity assumptions we've got included in
there. But I think that's a really good place to start. And what I would say is in the fourth quarter, one thing that's a
little bit different, we had been buying treasury securities. And right now we're more focused on mortgage backs
and municipals. We feel like that's a better place for us right now from a risk reward standpoint. I mean, those
yields are, you know, in the third quarter of what we purchased was a little bit better than the yields we'd
assumed. Obviously, that helped part of our beat as well.
And so we're seeing yields in the fourth quarter north of 5% in those products. So, that's kind of what we're
thinking about. And as we go into 2023, then we'll revisit what sort of a investment program we put together. But I
think that your start at $1 billion a quarter is a good place to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then I wanted to circle back on the tangible common equity ratio of 3.85%. It seems like you guys are
not concerned about it at that level. Is there a level of TCE that would be concerning to you guys? I think the
FHLB has some restrictions if you go below a certain level and some public funds account also has some
restrictions if you trip a certain level. So is there any TCE ratio that would be concerning or do you just not care?
You got almost 13% common equity Tier-1, so TCE just doesn't matter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't think there's any operational concern over that number, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then my last question is just on the provision. I think you guys have had coming up on two
years of a zero provision. The reserve ratio percentage has been coming down. With the economic uncertainty
out there, do you think we start to see some provisioning costs in the near-term or do you think that, that reserve
has room to potentially go lower and the zero provision can continue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Brady, I think that's a great question. I mean, that's the sort of conversations we're having right now. You're
right, we haven't booked a provision for a while. I think if we found ourselves in a situation where we thought
couple of things. If we thought or if we saw actual loan growth quite a bit higher than maybe we had this quarter,
and if you combine that with maybe a more concerning sort of a rate environment and a more concerning sort of
lending environment, we could find ourselves with provisions. I don't think we're – I think it's the sort of
conversation that we'll be having throughout the quarter. I don't think it's a slam dunk either way. All things being
equal, if we did record a provision – need a provision in the fourth quarter, I couldn't see that it would be anything
13


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
that really material. But you are right, I think that the conversations continue to be good with the CECL execution
committee. We are having a lot of good conversations. And I wouldn't be completely surprised either way, to be
honest with you, if we recorded zero or if we recorded some small provision of a couple of million, I wouldn't be
surprised. And a lot of it is going to depend on how we see the environment over the next quarter.

Operator: Our next question is from Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. Please proceed. Jennifer, please
check and see if your line is muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon. Just curious about what you're seeing within your asset quality trends. Are you
seeing any weakness underneath the covers in any areas that are worth noting at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jennifer, the short answer is really no. We talk about what are we seeing. I mean there inflation is, a lot of people
haven't gone through that. I kid to John that some of the analysts have been doing this a long time, obviously so
have I. And we've been through inflationary cycles before. A lot of people haven't that are in business today. And
we're careful to make sure that we're asking the right questions and our loan officers are particularly ones who do
not live in an increasing rate environment, inflationary environment, understand what to ask and the things that
can be happening to businesses.
I think the things to watch are commercial real estate deals and probably not so much existential credit issues as
opposed to are they going to be able to meet certain covenants if you've got covenants in there where you have
to be able to cash flow X times debt service and you assume some kind of phantom debt service number. I mean,
those numbers are getting pretty high. And I don't think that they'll really have much, like I say, existential impact
on things. But you could see some risk rates move as a result of that.
I think we're seeing, you know, you're seeing cap rates beginning to rise, particularly on deals that don't have the
opportunity to increase rents, like, you're not seeing cap rates move so much on multifamily where you get an
opportunity to change those rents in relation to inflation, whereas you might see an industrial deal with a single
tenant, very high credit quality tenant, but those are long-term leases. You're not going to get the opportunity to
increase those cash flows from rental rate increases. So, you're seeing cap rates move up on those. You can ask
yourself, is that going to affect these deals at all.
But if you look at us, we saw problem loans decline this quarter. We saw non-performers decline this quarter. So
it's still hard to see it anywhere. But if you look at the real estate area, you look at deals, people being more – you
know, they're pausing certain deals, are going back to the drawing board on certain deals, and so things are
slowing somewhat. I think interest rates are a factor there that it's trying to slow things down. I think they're being
14


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
somewhat successful there. And I think usually anytime you have a large election, I think business owners tend to
pause a little bit and see what happens if there's any great change that might occur one way or the other. And I
think we're probably feeling a little bit of that. So, no cracks right now. Credit still looks really good. And we'll just
have to see what the economy does from here.

[ph] Good evening (44:13).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. One, in terms of the branch expansion, could you remind us after
the end of the year how many more branches you have remaining in terms of as you think about opening in
2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I would guess in round numbers you've got about 15 to do in Dallas, and probably 4-ish or so, four, five, in
Houston for our 2.0 expansion. So, we'll be seeing round numbers around 20.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And anything, just given the environment, better or worse, that would make you want to do accelerate or
maybe open more branches than these or what you had initially planned, given the success that you've had in any
new markets that you're looking at, Phil, in terms of they might deploy the same strategy over the next year or
two?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think the thing that we'll do is we'll continue to look at attractive markets in the state. We're not done with
that. And we've talked about for years now about understanding the Austin market, and how that may or may not
be different from some of the larger strategies we've used in Dallas and Houston, and we're continuing to do that.
I think if you heard us talk on the calls, last couple of calls. We've had some in some new locations in what I'll call
the more consumer-oriented markets. They're more rooftops than they are, well, I'll call premier businesses there.
And you know that about two-thirds, 70% of the profitability of this strategy has been always based on the
commercial middle-market piece.
But some of the returns and some of the performance we've had in these more consumer-centric, now, admittedly
higher income consumer-centric markets has been pretty remarkable. And it results in two things. One is your mix
of assets leans a little harder on the consumer side. If you look at our Dallas early numbers, again, Dallas was
early in the game. But it's interesting that half of our loans are consumer loans in the Dallas market and half
commercial as opposed to, let's say, take Houston, which is like 80% commercial, 20% consumer. And so, the
reason I mention that is that I think it gives them opportunity in those markets that might be more house top
oriented. And the other thing about those markets is they tend to be a little bit smaller, so they don't have to be as
big. And if it turns out that what we're seeing in these markets has legs that I think it could open up some new
opportunities for us in markets that we've already been in, which might have [indiscernible] (47:39) a little bit more
consumer-centric. And I think it also might help us as we evaluate some of these new markets that we might go
into, new geographies and state that might be a little bit more consumer-centric than commercial. It could be that
those might actually be viable markets for us as well.
So, I think what we've been seeing recently to me makes me a little bit more optimistic on our ability to continue to
expand the strategy. And like I say, we're going to see more and more. I think the strategy is I used two words
about it, I believe that it's scalable and I believe it's durable, and I believe that we'll be doing this for a long time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Phil. And I guess one follow-up for you, Jerry. If I heard you correctly, did you say
you are adding mostly mortgage-backed securities right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Munis and mortgage-backed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And I guess the question is, as we think about there are other banks who are trying to hedge their margins to
prevent if rates begin to go lower at some point over the next few years, anything that you're doing synthetically in
terms of defending the margin against lower rates, and how do you think – and I guess with the mortgage
securities, it does increase prepayment risk if and when rates go lower. So, just want to get your thought process
around managing the margin against lower rates?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Yeah. So, some obviously we continue to have those conversations. I think that part of the conversation obviously
is all the liquidity that we have, some of the analysis we do is, of course, if we thought rates were going down, we
could make bigger bets, right, with all that liquidity in hand, which certainly would help protect the margin during a
period of decreasing rates. So, I think that that's one of the things that's out there.
And, I think the other thing that we've talked about, and this is outside of the investment portfolio, obviously, is that
given our deposit rates, we've got a lot more room than most to bring deposit rates down. I mean, we've proven
that we will and we can in the low rate environment. We did it when we started raising rates in 2017. And when
rates came down in 2019 and 2020, we were moving our rates down. So we've got that opportunity as well. I
mean, it's not something that we would want to do, but we're certainly not afraid to do it and could do it to protect
the margin, but, again, also analyzing where those purchases could be. We could make, I'll call them bullet-type
purchases of significant amounts of liquidity if we decided we wanted to do that.
