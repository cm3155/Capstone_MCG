performance. We generated earnings of $556 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.59 and one of the best
return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at 24%.
Our consistent, strong earnings performance has given the board confidence to increase the quarterly common
stock dividend by 20%, which was officially reported in a press release earlier this week. Although some lingering
economic uncertainty remains, we feel good about our ability to carry this momentum into second half of the year.
We continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, robust liquidity position and prudent credit risk
management.
Our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment. And our
granular deposit base and relationship based banking approach continue to serve us well. Overall sentiment
among our Corporate customers remains relatively positive, despite ongoing labor shortages, persistent
inflationary pressure and slowly improving supply chain issues.
In fact, most are continuing to forecast solid performance in 2023, although later expecting modest declines from
levels experienced in 2022. We remain committed to serving our customers while maintaining our focus on risk
adjusted returns. We're being judicious with capital, preserving it for our best clients and relationships. Year-to-
date the Corporate Bank has grown loans 2%, in line with our expectations with the vast majority of this growth
coming from existing customers.
Our Consumer customers also remain healthy. Unemployment in 7 of our 8 top states remains at or near
historical lows, and housing prices in 13 of our 15 states are forecast to outperform the HPI Index in 2023. Wages
in most of our footprint have kept pace with or exceeded increases in inflation. And as a result, Consumer deposit
balances and credit card payment rates remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Our credit quality remained
strong. Although normalization continues, charge-offs remain below historical through-the-cycle levels.
We also continue to benefit from the strategic investments we're making in our business. For example, over the
last few years, we've focused on enhancing our treasury management suite of products and services. We've
invested in talent and technology, including data and analytics, improving our ability to provide our clients with
data driven insights. Today, our relationship managers lead every prospective client conversation with a cash flow
mindset, enabling us to clearly understand our customer needs. We're very pleased with the success of our
treasury management business, which has produced 13% revenue growth year-over-year. Although our
penetration rate for treasury management solutions ranks among the top versus peers, we continue to see further
opportunity in our existing customer base, particularly in lower end commercial.
Additionally, during the second quarter, we introduced Regions no-cost Overdraft Grace feature, giving
consumers the opportunity to remedy overdrafts and avoid fees. To date, the data indicates that customers are
seeing an approximate 30% reduction in the occurrence of a cess fees. We're excited about the financial benefits
and flexibility our customers are enjoying as a result of changes we've made over the past two years.
We also continue to actively search for investment opportunities with respect to mortgage servicing rights. And
during the last 18 months, we've acquired the rights to service approximately $23 billion in mortgage loans
through a combination of bulk purchases and flow deals. These are just a few examples of our commitment to
investing in markets, technology talent and capabilities to grow and diversify our revenue base and enhance
offerings to our customers.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially. Average business
loans also increased 1%, reflecting high quality, broad based growth across the telecommunications, multifamily
and energy industries. Loan demand remained stable during the quarter and we had the opportunity to continue
growing faster. However, as John mentioned, we are committed to appropriate risk adjusted returns and now is
not the time to stretch for growth. We are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship
and proven history. Approximately 84% of this quarter's business loan growth was driven by existing clients
accessing and expanding their credit lines. Average Consumer loans increased 1% as growth in the mortgage
and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we
expect 2023 ending loan growth of 3% to 4%.
From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and a differentiating factor across the peer set,
with balances continuing to largely perform as expected. Our deposits are highly operational in nature, granular in
size, and generally receive more coverage through FDIC insurance than most peers. Although banking turmoil
late in first quarter introduced some additional uncertainty to the company's outlook, deposits largely performed as
expected, ending the first half of the year down $4.8 billion.
As part of our practice of maintaining a diversity of funding sources, total deposits include approximately $1 billion
of deposits composed of brokered CDs and wholesale market transactions. Recall this is in addition to the
brokered CDs we acquired as part of the EnerBank acquisition, which are maturing over time. Deposit declines
came largely from higher balance and more rate-sensitive customers across all three businesses.
We also saw continued diversification of customer dollars across various Regions offerings, such as from interest
rate checking to CDs or money market deposits, and movement out of deposits to offerings through our Wealth
Management platform and in the Corporate Banking segment, utilization of off balance sheet money market
mutual fund solutions.
In the case of Corporate clients, overall liquidity under management has remained solid, increasing almost 3%
since the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, a tightening Federal Reserve, observed through increasing
interest rates and reductions in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, along with heightened competition, will likely
continue to constrain deposit growth for the industry through year-end. Accordingly, we expect deposits to be
modestly lower over the balance of the year, and we expect the continued remixing into interest-bearing
categories.
So let's shift to net interest income and margin. As expected, net interest income declined by 2.5% in the second
quarter. This represents the beginning of a reversion from elevated net interest income and margin levels back
towards our longer-term range, mostly due to deposit and funding cost normalization.
Regions' balance sheet remains asset sensitive. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net
interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and
fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower yielding loans and securities. At this stage in the rate cycle, we
expect deposit cost increases through a continuation of repricing and remixing trends. Importantly, recent trends
remain within our expectation.
The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 26%, and our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% cycle-to-date beta by
year-end. Longer term, deposit performance will be heavily influenced by the amount of time monetary policy
remains tight. Deposit betas could ultimately exceed the 35% in 2024, assuming higher rates for longer.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Regardless, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for
Regions when compared to the broader industry.
Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of
the range is supported using June 30 market forward interest rates, or approximately one additional 25 basis point
hike this year. Third quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately 5%, driven by continued
deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period for a number of previously
transacted forward starting receive-fixed swaps.
The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earning stability in today's uncertain environment.
Hedges added to date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. While no meaningful
hedging was transacted during the quarter, we continue to look for opportunities to add balance sheet protection
beyond 2025 at attractive market rate levels.
Since quarter-end, we have added $1 billion of forward starting swaps and $500 million of forward starting rate
collars, near recent highs that will become effective in 2026, 2027, and 2028. A resulting balance sheet is
constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates
move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain at or above the
midpoint of the range.
Let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 8% from the prior quarter,
as increases in capital markets and card and ATM fees were partially offset by declines in Other categories. Total
capital markets income increased $26 million. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased
3% sequentially, driven primarily by growth in real estate capital markets, partially offset by declines in M&A fees,
debt underwriting, and loan syndication income.
We had a negative $9 million CVA and DVA adjustment reflecting credit spread tightening during the quarter.
However, this was a $24 million improvement versus the first quarter. Card and ATM fees increased 7%, driven
by seasonally higher spend and transaction volume as well as a first quarter $5 million rewards reserve
adjustment that did not repeat.
Service charges declined slightly during the quarter. As John mentioned, we introduced our Overdraft Grace
feature in mid-June. Based on our experience to date, we now expect full year service charges of approximately
$575 trillion (sic) [$575 million] (00:13:47). With respect to outlook, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted
total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 8% compared to the prior
quarter and includes the previously announced elevated operating losses related to check fraud. Excluding the
approximately $80 million associated with incremental check fraud incurred this quarter, adjusted non-interest
expenses remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter. We have effective countermeasures in place and
losses have returned to normalized levels.
Salaries and benefits decreased 2%, primarily due to lower payroll taxes and 401(k) expense, partially offset by
an entire quarter of annual merit increases and higher head count. The FDIC insurance assessment increase was
driven by changes in various inputs, including normalized credit conditions and increases in average assets. We
remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to continue funding investments in our business,
including optimizing square footage.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
As an example, this quarter we entered into an agreement to sell two of our largest operation centers totaling over
450,000 square feet. We will continue to refine our expense base, focusing on our largest categories, which
include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend.
We expect full year 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up approximately 6.5% and continue to expect to
generate positive adjusted operating leverage.
From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs
were 33 basis points in the quarter. Non-performing loans decreased, while business service criticized loans and
total delinquencies increased. Provision expense was $118 million or $37 million in excess of net charge-offs. The
allowance for credit loss ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.65%, and the allowance as a percentage of non-
performing loans increased to 332%. The allowance increased due primarily to normalizing credit, modest
economic outlook changes and loan growth.
Allowance for credit losses on the office portfolio increased from 2.2% to 2.7%. Importantly, the single office loan
on non-performing status is paying as agreed. Additionally, the vast majority of our office exposure is in Class A
properties, located primarily within the Sunbelt. Overall, we continue to feel good about the composition of our
office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio.
While we expect net charge-offs will continue to normalize over the back half of the year, we continue to expect
our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points. We also expect to return to our
historical through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points in 2024.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 10.1%.
Although we were not required to participate in this year's supervisory capital stress test, we did receive our
preliminary Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting planned capital changes, including the dividend increase John
referenced. Our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer will remain at 2.5% from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the
third quarter of 2024.
Additionally, we have access to sources of liquidity at June 30 totaling approximately $53 billion, including
collateral we have in a ready status at the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding
Program and the discount window. These sources are sufficient to cover all retail uninsured deposits plus
wholesale non-operational deposits by approximately a 3 to 1 ratio. Given current macroeconomic conditions and
regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate continuing to manage capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near
term.
And finally, we have a slide summarizing our expectations which we have addressed throughout the prepared
comments.
With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a little on the deposit pricing thoughts.
So you kept the interest-bearing deposit beta assumption, which is great, but softened the deposit growth
expectation a bit, maybe a thought or two on how you're thinking about the balance between flows and pricing.
And then when we think about that beta assumption potentially going higher into next year, as you had suggested
vis-à-vis the current 35% expectation, what are sort of the major puts and takes as you think about? I mean,
obviously sort of time is a big one, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. This is David. So, with regards to deposit pricing, it's important that – if I understand, that we think about our
customers, we talk to our business leaders in terms of what we need to do to support our customer base and
what's going on from a competitive landscape. And so through that, we form an opinion as to what our deposit
beta ought to be.
And I would tell you that going into last quarter, we've had 35% beta now for just beginning of the year, and we
had a little bit cushion in that, we believe, pretty conservative, based on what we've seen and the competitive
pressures that we've seen and obviously events of March 8. It's probably not as conservative, we believe is the
right number, but we don't have as much conservatism in it as we had.
With regards to what we're thinking about beta going into 2024, we really needed to understand what the Fed's
thinking. And, right now, if they have one more increase and kind of stay on hold for a while, you probably have a
couple of quarters before betas start creeping up on you. So, we had originally called for the end of the cycle at
the end of 2023. Because this has been elongated a bit, the cycle is going to continue into 2024 to some degree,
and that's all dependent on when they stop. And so if they have one more increase at the next meeting, it'll be
sooner. If they keep going, another increase after that, it'll be later.
So those are probably the biggest drive – individual drivers. You have other things like competition. Whether we
have to be competitive and so what our competition does, we have to react to some degree. So that's another
driver.
And then the overall Fed balance sheet. So the Fed's down about $800 billion since the beginning of the year.
Fed balance sheet is going to continue to drip down a little bit, which will take liquidity out of the system and put
some pressure on there. So there's several things. That's why it's hard to be precise on what the beta is going to
be. But I think there should be some expectation that there's a little bit of a increase in 2024, the amount of which
we can't tell you precisely. We'll continue to look and search for that and update you as we change our opinion on
that.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. Thank you very much. And then wanted to ask just a super quick one on sort of the background
behind the favorable $25 million adjustment you made to the expected full year service charges numbers. Sounds
like it's simply a better understanding based on the early observations from the rollout of the new initiative, but
would love to hear any incremental color you have there as well, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, it actually wasn't that. The driver is because our – what's embedded in service charge is also treasury
management and our treasury management group has done a great job this year growing relationships, were up
about 9% our relationships and if you look at revenue, our revenue on treasury management is up some 13%.
And so we saw that happen in the first part – the first quarter. We want to see if it continued, it did in the second
quarter. And so our service charge from 24-hour grace is about what we – where we forecasted it. So you add all
that together and just on a run rate basis, you can see we're going to be higher than what we had originally
guided. And that was the single driver.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
David, can you share with us – I know we don't know what the final outcomes will be from the regulatory changes
that are on the horizon, possibly if we get them next week. But can you share with us how you guys are thinking
about how it might impact you in terms of the long-term debt portion of the TLAC, as well as the higher risk-
weighted asset assumptions possibly from mortgages, which came out I think this week, and any other issues that
are surrounding this whole regulatory change that's on the horizon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So, let me just give you an overall comment, and then I'll break down some of the elements. So overall,
Gerard, what we're hearing, what we're seeing, we can – we'll be able to adapt and overcome whatever it is that
we have to. We think the Fed is going to give us all time to adapt to whatever those changes are going to be
without any major disruption.
So specifically on debt, we're hearing potentially a 6% of RWA number for those over $100 billion. Maybe there's
some tailoring, but let's just use the 6% for easy math. That's an incremental $5 billion of debt for us that we will
have to raise over time. We will be able to leverage that $5 billion into our business, and including putting some of
it at the bank that will reduce our deposit insurance premium some.
And when you wrap all that together, you're talking about 60 basis points to 70 basis points of all-in cost for us on
that $5 billion. So, you're talking about $35 million bottom line hit if that were to happen, fully implemented. So it's
just not – it's not something that's pretty easy to overcome. We don't think it's necessary, but we don't get to make
the rules. We just have to adapt and overcome.
With regards to the RWA, so we're hearing conflicting things. There's clearly some additional operational risk
we're going to have to put into RWAs. We're supposed to get some benefit though on the credit side, whether it
be from mortgages or investment grade. If all that happens like Basel intended, then it's a push and no big deal.
On the other hand, if we don't get the benefits we're supposed to on the credit risk weights, then that will cost us a
little bit of capital. And again, we'll tether that in over time.
Outside of Basel but probably part of the NPR that will be coming out will be AOCI. AOCI is likely to be in the
capital regime going forward, which, in a stress basis, actually is helpful, because your AOCI is in a gain position.
But in a rising rate environment, which is good for banking, because that's where we make most of our money,
from a capital standpoint, you'll have to tether that AOCI in over time. Again, they're talking about starting maybe
in 2025 or 2026 and then giving you three to five years to do that.
And again, we can – we'll be able to handle that. Some of that takes care of itself just because of the maturities of
the investment portfolio, and so – and then rates coming down the other way. So, again, the bottom line is where I
started. Whatever it is, we'll adapt and overcome.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, I think you guys mentioned that you sold a couple of operation centers, or you're in
agreement to sell a couple of operation centers. I didn't hear, are you going to vacate them as well, or is it just
more of a sales leaseback situation? And then second, the price you receive for them, how does that compare to
what they may have been valued a couple of years ago at?

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the first part is, we will lease one of the buildings – some of the square footage for a relatively short
period of time to help us transition. But for the most part, we're going to be vacating both of those buildings. I
mean, the world has changed since we've built all that, and we just don't need the space. And of course, working
remotely has been a piece of that, too.
So, we think it's a good deal not only for our customer base but for our community, because what's going there,
we think, will be very helpful to the community. We're going to be able to get out, sell that. It will be a book value
to a slight gain on the sale. Not anything to write home about, but we'll make a little bit of money on that.

tie into the whole commercial real estate lower values that we're hearing about?

John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Gerard, it's John. I'm not sure it's a relevant question. We're selling to the taxing authority that – so
we're selling to the city that we occupied, and our tax valuation was unchanged over the three-year period, and so
it's based on tax valuation. So I'm not sure that we can give you a good answer to your question.

average earning assets from here, if [indiscernible] (00:30:10) coming down a little bit and loan growth kind of
given your clear view of that, and just wondering how that fits in with your securities and cash in between in terms
of what [indiscernible] (00:30:19) does.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think you'll see a modest decline there, Ken. I think the deposit decline, normalization, remember, we had
a lot of surge deposits. We've been calling for runoff a bit. We were pretty close to our number through the second
quarter. Rates are higher longer. I think that's going to have some switching costs associated with it. There's
going to be some off-balance sheet movement as well. We think our non-interest-bearing drifts down to that mid-
30s, which is what we've been calling for. I think today we're at about 37%.
So as a result of that decline, you should expect average earning assets to decline along with that. When we talk
about modestly, we're talking 1% to 2%, frankly. And – but we'll see. We're continuing to grow checking accounts.
The core of our franchise are checking accounts and operating accounts. And we are all over trying to grow that
and take advantage of the markets that we're in, which is very favorable as we see the migration of people and
businesses into our market. So we think this is some more normalization and then we think it kind of settles out
after that modest decline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Okay. Got it. And just on the loan side, I'm just wondering resi mortgage and EnerBank have been the
biggest parts of your loan growth for a while now. Just wondering, does that continue to be your expectation of
where you'll get the majority of growth? And within that, I guess, if you can just give us an update on how
EnerBank's been doing relative to your expectations. Thanks, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So our growth has really been driven thus far in total from the commercial side. That is going to slow a bit.
We can just – as we talk to customers, we could see the demand for credit isn't quite what it was. Obviously there
are transactions that are harder to get done in real estate because we are – based on where rates are, we're
requiring more equity in the deal and developers don't want to do that. So things don't happen. There's still a big
demand for housing, resi portfolio. We will continue to grow some. We have a good group of MLOs that are out
there. The housing supply is still way below where it should be. Now rates are up and so that's going to mute
things.
From an EnerBank standpoint, we've had pretty good growth. They have met the expectations that we have laid
out for them. We'll see some slowing a bit in the second half and into 2024. We had a pretty big solar program
going at one time. The math on that got to a point where it was not as profitable as we had originally hoped for.
And so we are not going to change – chase loan growth until – unless we can get paid appropriately for the risk
that we take. As a result that's going to slow a bit in EnerBank. That being said, we're very happy with what
they're doing. And you're going to see growth just not at the pace that we have had.

John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
On your NII guide, was just wondering about the timing of the rate hikes you're factoring in there. It sounded like
you were assuming July, but just wanted to confirm that. And then on your deposit comment that you're factoring
in that decline further on the DVA side and just overall, was just wondering what the rough average cost is of that
incremental deposits that you're bringing in to replace some of that DVA? What's your assumption there? Is it 5%,
5.5% or is it closer to maybe some of your lower core accounts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's right at 5%. And you're correct, we did factor in the increase – rate increase in July.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay, great. Maybe on capital, the plan to manage CET1 at or slightly above 10%. Given you're there now, just
wanted to get your thoughts on the chances of your restarting that buyback once you get more clarity on the
capital requirements next week, or do you think there's maybe a better possibility that you restart that in 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
It is probably more likely a 4Q. We keep thinking we're going to get clarification. We thought June 30, has been
pushed out. So we don't know exactly when we're going to get it. But whatever we do, we'll sift through the
material and we'll come up with an appropriate plan. Until we know that plan, just doesn't make any sense. I mean
we had, I think, the highest return this quarter on tangible common equity. There's just no need for us to push on
the – to push on share buyback right now. Let's just be a little bit cautious and deal with the new rules and then
after that, if buying our shares back is appropriate, then that's what we'll do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then one last one on credit. Just wanted to get your thoughts on your office reserve ratio at this point. I
know you don't know what's in the other office books out there like some of these other banks that we're just
seeing reserve ratios that are a little bit more elevated at some of the larger banks and I know you mentioned you
don't expect any losses in that book, was just hoping you could just talk a little bit more about what's giving you
comfort with that – the 2-handle that you've got on there right now on the reserve ratio. Thanks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. This is John. I'll answer that. So, our office portfolio is about $1.7 billion. Roughly 36% of
that portfolio is single tenant. And of that single tenant exposure, 82% is investment grade. So we sort of look at
that $700 million and feel like that we understand that, it's well secured, is performing. So – then we look at the $1
billion portfolio that remains that's multi-tenant. 63% of that is in the Sunbelt. Beyond that, it is well diversified
geographically. Largest concentration we have is in the Dallas-Fort Worth market where about 20% of the
portfolio or exposure actually resides.
There are about 100 credits make up that $1 billion. So we have very good visibility into the relationships and to
the performance of those particular credits. When I think about how we're doing, we've been talking to customers
well in advance of maturities and we have a fair number of maturities in 2023 and 2024. Performance to date has
been good. We've had 13 credits that have matured already this year and over half of those or half of those
credits had an extension option which they were able to exercise.
Another 20-plus-percent renewed based on our current credit underwriting standards and the balance either paid
off – we have one credit that we're still working on. That's the one non-accrual that we have in the portfolio. And
so all in all, our assessment of our portfolio – our office portfolio is pretty good. We have said we don't think we
have any significant losses in the portfolio, and that's been confirmed by, again, in conversations we're having
with customers, our visibility into what's occurred to date and what we think will occur over the next 12 to 18
months.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we are in the formative stage of putting in our new systems, focusing on the deposit system. It'll be the
biggest and all of them are important to us, but that was really important to us. We are planning right now. We are
laying the foundation. We are spending some money. We've been spending money for quite some time, but
you're not going to see benefits for a number of years, Matt. We've got to go through and what we've learned from
talking to others that have gone through these type journeys is it is much better to take your time and be planful
and will reduce – ultimately will reduce the overall cost.
So we're going through a number of customer journeys and really thinking through not just putting in a new
system, but how can we really transform how we do business and how can we make it easier for our customers to
bank with us, how we can make it easier for our associates to take care of our customers and so it's a lot of work.
And so you're going to see cost upfront, which is what we're experiencing today before you'll see the benefits, it'll
be a few years out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And remind us of the timeline. I think it was back in 2019 you first started talking about it and I thought you said it
might be five or six years, but update us on the timeline, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That's right. It's going to be yet another five years from now before you see this. So we have a deposit system.
We'll be putting in a new commercial loan system and we'll be putting in a consumer loan system as well. But the
biggest one and the most expensive one will be the deposit system. That's at least three years out before that
gets put in.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. First question is clarifying sort of the statements on NII, David. So based on your guidance, the
fourth quarter 2023 net interest income "exit rate" will be somewhere between $1.31 billion and $1.32 billion. Sort
of based on what you're telling us, should we expect perhaps a step-down in the first quarter due to day count,
and like you said, the continuation of data creep? But then would there be stability from there or an opportunity for
reprice if the Fed cuts? I'm trying to just triangulate your comments on NIM, which are very helpful to the NII
quarterly cadence.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we won't confirm your number exactly, but your thinking is spot on that as we get to the end of the year,
we start stabilizing a bit. And the question is where does the Fed stop? If they go one more time and stop, then
14


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
the only thing you really have bleeding into the first quarter will be slight beta risk and the day count that you
talked about. So I think you have stability from thereon.
However, if the Fed continues to push this out even more and has to go two, three – two more hikes, three more
hikes, and you just push everything out, we do have hedges that are becoming live this quarter. You can see that
on our page 6 in our deck. And so we put those on over a year ago with anticipation that there was risk that rates
actually roll over, start going down. They didn't.
And so we'll be in a bit of a negative carry on those, which is okay, because the rest of our book is earning a
whole lot more money than we thought at the time. So that's all been factored in to the guidance that we gave
you. And right now, we're expecting that we get to the end of the year and things really start to settle out, with
exception of minor tweaks in that first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And could you remind us sort of how much in total the check fraud you should have in your expense base
for 2023? And as we think about your natural [indiscernible] (00:43:06) run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we have a schedule on our supplement on it. Let me flip, see if I can find it real quick for you, because
we were anticipating this question. We wanted to give everybody an understanding. It's on page 15 of the
supplement, and it's embedded in the operational loss number. And that change related to check fraud was about
$80 million as we mentioned in the call. But you could see our operational losses had averaged about $13 million
to $18 million per quarter. And we are back to that kind of run rate now. And so, we expect to be there about that
number going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in, and this is for John, we're sitting here now, July 21, 2023, and your
firm is in a position of great strength. I'm wondering – and I'm asking about organic opportunities. Don't think I'm
wrapping an M&A question around this. But as you think about [indiscernible] (00:44:20) on more stringent RWA
diet than you, given where your capital is today, how are you thinking about playing offense, as we think through
[indiscernible] (00:44:33), how do you leverage that deposit base that will stay inexpensive and the capital that
seems to be building nicely and the credit that seems relatively stable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Erika, we're continuing to add talent. So we're continuing to hire talent. We're in some very good markets. We
have acquired a number of capabilities over the last number of years. And so it's really combining talent with
opportunity and markets with additional capabilities. We just execute our plan. We're asking our bankers to be
active in markets, talking to customers and non-customers, looking for ways to expand our business.
And while there is still some economic uncertainty and we want to be prudent and careful, we start with
soundness first, followed by profitability, and then growth. We think we are in a position, as you pointed out, to win
market share where opportunities exist. And we are focused on those prospects that we've been calling on for a
15

long time and relationships that we've had for a long time to ensure that we use the capital and the resources we
have to support those companies as they want to grow their businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Erika, this is David. Let me add to that. So, we do realize there could be opportunities for us to grow loans
faster than what we just gave you the guidance on. So we gave you guidance of 3% to 4%. We've reduced that
slightly because of the demand that I had talked about earlier.
We want to grow relationships. We aren't interested in taking advantage of somebody's RWA diet and growing
loans only. We cannot outstrip our funding base, because that marginal profitability just won't be there if you're
having to wholesale fund that growth. So, if we can get a relationship to bring, say, an operating account and
other deposits, we're all over that. But we're not interested in just growing loans because somebody else wants to
shed that risk.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Yeah, just a ticky-tacky one at this stage. AOCI pull to par, what should we be thinking about with regard to how
that's going to pull quarterly over the next four, six quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think we have a schedule in the back, it's on slide number 17 that shows by the end of 2024, about 25% of
that will be rolled in and then by the end of the next year, about 39%, that's using just maturities and forwards at
this time.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Okay. And that's on just AFS book, obviously, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then your strategy for the securities portfolio in general, are you going to be adding to it over time or what are
you doing with the excess deposit growth that you got? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we've historically been 18% to 20% of our earning assets on securities. We suspect we'll be roughly in
that range. We have to think through is what the new regime will be with regards to AOCI. As you're probably
aware, the AOCI changes with regards to securities becomes part of your capital. But the fair market value
changes with regards to derivatives is not.
And so, what that does is it causes you to at least think about if we need the duration protection that we use our
securities book for along with liquidity, that perhaps we use more derivatives than securities and we'll just have to
see. But I don't see that changing our securities book appreciably. Will it be down a notch or two, perhaps, but I
don't think you would – you should expect us to grow that book much past that 20% range.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Back to the deposit beta. I know you indicated the potential for an increase in 2024 [indiscernible] (00:49:10). Any
way to help us [indiscernible] (00:49:13) that look likely if we are in a higher for longer environment or could it be
up there where some of your competitors are flagging in the mid-40s and maybe even up there in the 50s where
some of them are at? Just curious if you can help us frame it out. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Deron Smithy A
Executive Vice President & Treasurer, Regions Financial Corp.
Hey, John. This is Deron Smithy. I'll take that one. So I think you're in the right neighborhood. Our expectations
would be that if the Fed is indeed done over the next couple of meetings, what you're seeing is just that residual
beta creep but that plays out over a couple of quarters. And then you have very modest increases from there. It
obviously depends on how long we're at that level. But I think somewhere in the upper 30s to around 40% is
reasonable in terms of how much it may continue to move.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it, Deron. No, that's helpful [indiscernible] (00:50:13) that. And then separately, just back on that O'Connor's
question on the systems conversion, can you remind us of your expectation around the cost of the conversion? I
know you had originally indicated that you don't expect it to impact your IT budget. Is that still the case or has it –
has that changed as you have landed on the vendor, etcetera? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, John, we're still in the formative stage of planning for that. I'll tell you, there's a lot of things going on
other than this, the system integration with regards to technology. The environment is changing to Software as a
Service versus buying a system and capitalizing it and depreciating that over time and skipping several of the
upgrades, because you don't want to pay for that.
Today, it's all going in the cloud, it's paying by the drink and that's more expensive and it's – so technology cost,
used to be technology costs go down over time. That does not appear to be the case. We are going to do our best
to control that while making appropriate investments in technology, because I think we can leverage that better
than we do today. We use a lot of human capital to do things. I think over time you're going to see most
everybody leveraging technology better.
And so, I think that right now we're at 9% to 11% of total revenue. I can see that drifting higher a bit over time. But
right now, that's our call of 9% to 11% and we'll update you as things change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And then 9% to 11% is the total IT budget?
