Good morning. Earlier this morning, we reported strong fourth quarter earnings, which put an exclamation point
on an incredible year for Old National. One that saw the closing of our transformational merger with First Midwest,
successful completion of all related systems conversions, tremendous client growth, and strong talent retention
and attraction. The strength of our combined franchise is evident in the results outlined on slide 4.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
Adjusted EPS was $0.56 per common share, representing a 10% increase quarter to quarter with a strong
adjusted ROA and ROATCE of 1.46% and 26.5%, respectively. Our efficiency ratio was a record low of 47.5%.
I'm pleased to share that we achieved the quarterly expense run rate necessary to fulfill our $109 million of
modeled merger expense savings.
Moving to slide 5. We reported GAAP earnings for the entire year of $1.50 per common share. Our adjusted EPS
was $1.96 per common share, representing a 13% increase over 2021. These robust quarterly and annual results
with [indiscernible] (02:27) returns were driven by a focused execution on our successful merger, maintaining our
strong low cost deposit franchise, growing loans with consistent strong credit standards, and disciplined expense
management. We were also pleased that the [indiscernible] (02:44) balances remained relatively flat for the year
excluding the recent sale of HSA deposits while maintaining our deposit pricing discipline with a low 12% deposit
beta cycle to date.
Another highlight in the year is our continual investment in top revenue-generating talent across our footprint. Our
story resonates well with these individuals. And our talent pipeline remains robust. You may have seen our recent
press release last week with the official launch of 1834, high net worth wealth manager brand. This is a fantastic
opportunity to leverage our combined franchise of strength and recent talent investments. We are already adding
new clients to 1834. As we look forward, we feel good about 2023 and expect loan portfolios to continue to grow,
albeit not at 2022 pace. In other areas, it should be more of the same, below peer deposit cost to drive a funding
advantage, more organic growth in our wealth management client base, a continued focus on its disciplined
expense management.
While we don't see anything meaningful on the horizon, it gives us cause for concern on credit, we know that our
granular portfolio, attention to client selection, and consistent underwriting guidelines, as well as our active
approach to credit management, will serve us well if the economy turns worse. In other words, we intend to stay
on the offense, but we are well positioned to withstand any new challenges that lie ahead.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brendon for further details.

Thanks, Jim. Turning to the quarter's results on slide 6, we reported GAAP net income applicable to common
shares of $197 million or $0.67 per share. Reported earnings include a $91 million of pre-tax gain from the sale of
our HSA business, which was partially offset by $27 million in pre-tax property optimization charges and $20
million in pre-tax merger-related charges. Excluding these items as well as debt securities losses, our adjusted
earnings per share was $0.56.
Slide 7 shows the trend in total loan growth, excluding PPP loans. Total loans were $606 million, led by
commercial growth of $438 million and consumer growth of $168 million. Both commercial and consumer grew an
annualized 8%. The investment portfolio decreased by 1% quarter over quarter due to reinvestment of portfolio
cash flows in support of loan growth. We expect $1.1 billion in total investment cash flows over the next 12
months.
Slide 8 provides further details of our commercial loans and pipeline. The strong fourth quarter growth was well
distributed with 8% annualized growth in C&I and 7% in CRE. Q4 production put some pressure on the pipeline,
but loan demand remains healthy and we expect the continued organic loan growth in the mid-single-digit range.
Turning briefly to pricing, new money yields on C&I increased 92 basis points from Q3 to 6.21% with new CRE

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
production yields up 131 basis points to 5.86%. We've maintained our pricing discipline throughout the race cycle
and are pleased that our spreads have remained stable.
Slide 9 show details of our Q4 commercial production. The $2.7 billion of production was well-balanced across all
product lines and major markets. In addition, all of our product segments posted quarter over quarter balance
sheet growth. We are pleased with the contribution from our newest LPO markets, which contributed almost $200
million in production this quarter.
Moving to slide 10, average deposits excluding the HSA sale were down 1% quarter over quarter with the mix of
our non-interest bearing deposits stable at 35%. End-of-period deposits were impacted $382 million related to the
HSA sale and an additional $400 million in seasonal public fund outflows. End-of-period deposits also reflects the
beginning of the mix shift from interest-bearing transaction accounts into time deposits.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio, combined with wholesale funding capacity and asset liquidity in the form of our
investment and indirect books, provides us flexibility in this competitive deposit market. That said, we are actively
defending deposit balances through competitive [ph] ramp rates (07:08) and pricing exceptions.
We are also playing offense through various deposit specials throughout our footprint. We are pleased with our
execution of this strategy to date as we have been able to generate new deposits sufficient to maintain stable
overall balances. Market conditions have put upward pressure on deposit rates with average total deposit cost of
22 basis points quarter per quarter to a still very low 34 basis points.
Interest-bearing deposit cost increased to 52 basis points, resulting in an industry-leading cycle-to-date beta of
12%. Our granular low-cost deposit base should continue to give us a funding advantage throughout the
remainder of this rate cycle.
Next, on slide 11, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Both metrics exceeded expectations
largely due to the outperformance of our deposit beta assumption. Net interest margin expanded 14 basis points
quarter over quarter to 3.85%, with core margin excluding accretion up 30 basis points to 3.75%.
Slide 12 provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range. Core margin for Q1
is expected to be in line with Q4, taking into account the 6 basis points of March decline related to [ph] beta
(08:25). Our outlook assumes deposit betas increasing from 12% today to a cycle-to-date beta in the first quarter
of 20%. The assumptions in our outlook also including CET1 target rate of 5% and a 4% yield on 10-year
treasuries at the end of the first quarter. Specific margin guidance is challenging the [indiscernible] (08:46). But
assuming that that [ph] pause will stay (08:47) in Q2 and deposit repricing persists, we would expect pressure on
margin in the back half of 2023. Also, while we remain well-positioned for rising rates, we have been proactively
adding down-rate protection, including an additional $400 million of new hedges this quarter, with an average floor
strike of 4%.
Slide 13 shows trends in adjusted non-interest income which was $74 million for the quarter. This was generally in
line with our expectations as market conditions continue to put pressure on mortgage and wealth revenues. The
linked quarter decrease was also impacted by lower capital markets fees, which reflect lower demand for interest
rate swap products given the rate environment. Fees were all impacted by one month of service charge
enhancements implemented in December that were discussed last quarter. Again, we estimate approximately $5
million annual impact from service charge enhancements.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
Next, slide 14 shows the trend in adjusted non-interest expenses. Adjusting for merger charges, property
optimization charges, and tax credit amortization, non-interest expense was $230 million, and our adjusted
efficiency ratio was an historically low 47.5%. Expenses decreased $7 million quarter over quarter due to lower
salaries and data processing expenses. Expenses were higher than anticipated due to $5 million quarter over
quarter increase in incentive accruals given our strong earnings performance for the year. Excluding incentive
adjustments, we are pleased to report that we have achieved a quarterly expense run rate consistent with our
modeled cost synergies.
We thought it would be helpful to provide additional detail on our 2023 expense outlook. We believe $225 million
is the correct quarterly run rate to build off for your 2023 models. From this $900 million annualized base, we
anticipate annual impact of $14 million in tax credit amortization, $11 million for [ph] Merrick (10:42), an
incremental increase in FDIC expenses of $9 million, and approximately $10 million in strategic investments in
both talent and technology enhancements. These investments will be partially funded with approximately $5
million in expense saves from the real estate optimization actions taken in Q4.
Slide 15 shows our credit trend. Credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios
continue to perform exceptionally well. Net charge-offs were a modest 5 basis points. Our special assets team is
continuing to work through our PCD loans and expect charge-offs from this portfolio to increase but with variability
from quarter to quarter. The provision expense impact on this effort should be minimal as we carry $59 million or
approximately 5% reserve against the PCD book.
On slide 16, you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance, including reserve for unfunded commitments,
which stands at $336 million, up $8 million over Q3. Note that during the quarter, we reclassified both current and
prior quarter allowance for unfunded commitments from non-interest expense to provision. Allowance for credit
loss totals and metrics now include the allowance for unfunded commitments, providing a more complete view of
our allowance levels. This accounting treatment is also more consistent with peers and should aim in
comparability.
Reserve build was driven primarily by strong loan growth with relatively small increases due to portfolio mix partly
offset by improvements in our economic forecast. The financial help for clients remain strong. And while credit
metrics are stable, we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated reserves given the uncertainty in our base case
and economic outlook.
Our current reserves reflect a relatively severe economic scenario, including negative GDP of 3.6% and
unemployment of 7.2%, which is at the top end of our supportable range. Unless the economic outlook
deteriorates materially, 2023 provision expense should be limited to portfolio performance and loan growth. In
addition to the $336 million in reserves, we also carry $102 million in acquired loan discount [ph] marks (12:49).
Slide 17 provides details on our capital position at quarter end. Capital ratios improved across the board. Our
CET1 ratio grew to a very healthy 10%, and our TCE ratio increased 36 basis points to 6.18%. Total OCI was
stable quarter over quarter but is still impacting our TCE ratio by 155 basis points. We continue to monitor our
balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We ended a transformational year for ONB with
fantastic full year results and then an even better fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 10% and tangible book value
per share grew 8% in the quarter. Key profitability ratio has also improved from very strong Q3 results, with an
adjusted return on tangible common equity of 26.5% and return on average assets of 1.46%.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
We posted another solid quarter of quality organic loan growth and defended our deposit base well. Net interest
income improved $15 million, with 30 basis points of core margin expansion and an industry-leading cycle-to-date
deposit beta of 12%. We are also pleased to have achieved a quarterly expense run rate consistent with our
modeled merger cost synergies, resulting in a record-low efficiency ratio of 47.5%.
Slide 18 includes thoughts and our outlook for 2023. We believe commercial sentiment and our year-end pipeline
supports mid-single-digit loan growth in 2023. Net interest income and margins should be consistent with the
guidance we outlined earlier, with pressure from deposit repricing in the back half of the year.
We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds, with mortgage following industry
patterns. While our wealth business will be subject to market volatility, we are beginning to see revenue
momentum from the strategic hires we've made over the last 18 months.
Capital markets revenue is under pressure and should perform consistent with Q4 levels. Service charge changes
implemented in December that are largely consistent with industry best practice will impact full year 2023 by
approximately $5 million. Our expense outlook is consistent with guidance we outlined earlier.
Turning to taxes, we expect approximately $14 million in tax rate amortization for 2023, with a corresponding full-
year effective tax rate of 24% on a core FTE basis, and 22% on a GAAP basis.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. We do have the full team available, including
Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren, and John Moran.

[ph] I appreciate (16:08) the guidance you guys gave on expenses and the waterfall is really helpful. When you
think about 2023, I think obviously, everyone's a little bit more skeptical in economic outlook. When you think
about hires, I know that's kind of a priority longer term and the investment in the company, taking decades rather
than quarters. But is there any way you would possibly slow because you don't necessarily want to hire lenders
going into a recession or any type of lending that you're looking to lean into?

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I just think there's great opportunities for us to tell our story. When we get those opportunities and people are
interested, I think we're always going to have a place for top talent. And Mark Sander said this really well. Top
talent will pay for itself. So while we'd be thoughtful and deliberate about all of our new hires, I think when given
the opportunity to attract. I mean, this is really the top quartile, top decile of each of the marketplaces. We're going
to go ahead and hire those folks.
But again, we'll be thoughtful if the economic outlook looks materially different than when we look at it today.
We're going to be thoughtful about adding expenses and we'll be diligent about looking at ways to reduce cost as
well. So, but at this point in time, I just don't see anything different than the plan, which is to go ahead and attract
the best possible talent we can to the organization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. That's fair. And then obviously, hires, as broadly speaking in terms of lenders. So when you think about
the fee income line, there's a lot of moving parts in a lot of different businesse. I know the recently announced
wealth management is a big positive, but obviously, you guys can't project the full year fee income with mortgages
involved a factor in that. But when you think about it, are we out of floor in mortgage? And from here, do you think
fee income rebounds holistically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Let me give you a 50,000-foot view and then I'll have our CFO jump in. I'd like to think that mortgage doesn't get
much worse than where we're at today, right? And a lot of the balance sheet, a lot of production doing today hit
their balance sheet, not the fee income line. In terms of wealth, the good news is we're basically taking our
business and dividing it into a couple of different businesses. And 1834 is one of those businesses, right? There's
not a big increase needed to staff that. And I would say that the talent we're looking for is both on the commercial
side, business banking, and – but it's also the wealth management side. That's a big part of where we're headed.
The good news is we have all the talent we need to get 1834 off the ground and running at a high level. So it's not
a big required investment there. But we do have high expectations that will grow kind of above our historic norms
in that business, despite what market conditions there. Market conditions are going to be what they're going to be.
But nonetheless, we have pretty high expectations around our ability to grow that organically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
And just before I turn over to Brendon, Ben, I'll just add to what Jim said. A number of those hires that we put on
in 2022 were in wealth management. So as we hired a dozen to 15 a quarter, probably half of those were
[indiscernible] (19:20). So we're not more than sufficiently staffed to grow in wealth. Brendon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
[ph] Probably (19:24) the only thing left to add on that than to double click into mortgage, I think we have to
remember year-over-year 2022, at least in the early part of the year did include some elevated [indiscernible]
(19:35) sale margins. So I'd say we had – we're at a slower terms of production, gain on sale margins today, but
7


Old National Bancorp
(ONB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
we were aided in the first half of last year by elevated [indiscernible] (19:45) sale margins. So that will impact
year-over-year numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Okay. I'd also like to think in the capital markets business, right? I mean it was a difficult time with rates rising very
quickly, but those businesses find a way to adjust and offer new products or different products, particularly if
there's a different set of newer rates emerging. So I think there'll be opportunities to grow that business.
Obviously, the fourth quarter is a tough quarter for that business overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. If I can sneak one more, and any appetite for potential repurchase or capital deployment? I know that
you guys were historically looking to kind of support the growth, but if growth is slowing down into a recession,
and just overall thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a little too early to want to jump in that. I think we need to have more clear picture of economic
outlook. Any issues related to credit out there, I think we need to have a much clearer picture before we want to
jump on top of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thank you. That just seemed gratuitous. But I certainly have to say – Brendon, everyone's – probably the most
exciting topic I can pick up. So in margin, you talked about margin pressure in the second half. You have sort of a
8

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
thought for order of magnitude and maybe a sense for a lower bound where the margins could settle in the event
that things do start to degrade?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
It's really hard, Scott, to pinpoint something. So much of this depends on what the Fed does, if the Fed kind of
keeps their foot on the gas. We could see maybe even marginal – margin expansion. But they pause for a while
and deposits continue to reprice. Low demand remains relatively strong. I think that would be that kind of the
worst-case scenario in terms of margin pressure. Just hard to know where those deposit betas fall out. The one
thing I'd – we continue to talk to ourselves about is whatever that is, I think we have a competitive advantage. Our
deposit beta was half the industry last cycle, and I expect we can have a significant advantage over the industry in
this cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. And I guess just for reference, when we talk about potential degradation in the second half. I know you're
hesitant to offer [indiscernible] (22:22) the first quarter. But is that [ph] 368 (22:24) the best starting point for the
margin or is something in like the low to mid [ph] 370s (22:29) more appropriate? In other words, it goes down in
the 1Q due largely to day counts. Does it go down and stay down or would it bounce back all else equal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
All else equal, right? It would bounce back. And so Q2 would not have the same level of day impact. And then
what happens in the back half of the year, I think is really going to come down to where do deposit costs fall out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
[indiscernible] (22:57) opposite direction, right? I mean, that can alleviate some pressure on deposit rates as well.

Good to hear from you, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Maybe just a question. Slide 12, you've got the 10-year at 4% by the end of this quarter versus the [ph] 3.50%
(23:33) today, and I'm just kind of wondering how that good impact, the outlook, the 10-year does not change.
And then maybe as a follow-up and some on NII, do you think even with some margin compression in the back
half of this year, the loan growth and the balance sheet growth can support growth in net interest income as we
progress throughout 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
I don't think – it's not a huge impact from the 10-year move around. It will impact a little bit of our investment book
and [indiscernible] (24:03), but not a huge material impact. It's the same thing with NII, certainly loan growth,
earning asset remix will help support NII. But the total NII, that was, again, I'd point back to the guidance, and it's
really going to come down to where deposit costs fall out in [indiscernible] (24:22) in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just stick with kind of the hedging strategy, added more swaps in the fourth quarter. Could
you maybe talk about kind of receive rate duration of the additional hedges? And bigger picture, what's the
strategy from here on, protecting the margin from lower rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, duration on the hedges have been roughly around three years. The average strike on that floor today is – of
the entire $2.2 billion, is right around 2.6%. The most recent ones obviously have a strike significantly higher than
that. So I think that'll provide some meaningful protection.
And as you think about it, as deposit costs continue to reprice up, if and when the Fed starts to move, we've got a
lot of support by being able to reduce deposit cost in the back half. So as we think about positioning the balance
sheet towards a more neutral position, I think we're a long way towards that goal already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Maybe one last small question, if I could. Is the tax rate creeping higher at 24% core FTE? It just seems
like it haven't gone back to past presentations. It just seems like it's kind of gotten higher the last few quarters. Am
I correct? And if so, what's behind that? And if I'm not, then we can move on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No, you're correct. Absolutely. We had – obviously with the [ph] SMB (25:46) partnership, we had a lot of
earnings, but our tax credit business has not increased by double. So we're working on a strategy if it's needed to
invest in that business and we look to move that forward but nothing in the near-term is going to change that, so
we [ph] took it out of the (26:00) guidance we gave you.

Brendon. Hey, good morning, Jim. Brendon or Jim, the efficiency ratio you talked about, you know, 47.5% just
been a great level. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of this metric? I know it's one metric, but
balancing both sides of the equation, how do we think about directionally that the efficiency ratio work kind of
settles?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So obviously, we give you the express outlook for 2023, where the efficiency ratio falls out will largely be a
function of where revenues – revenue sit. But I can tell you this sort of this − I don't know that we can repeat
47.5%, but I do think for the full year, we're going to have a really strong efficiency ratio, and we continue to work
on opportunities that you're going to need to control expenses.

Yeah. I would just suggest that, Chris. We've had a long history of being very disciplined around the expense
base here, and it was obviously been nice to have some tailwind from the revenue side to help us out. But having
said that, there's no magic bullets or no easy wins out there, but it's going to be a continued long-term focus on
driving expenses lower. A lot of these come through just long-term enhancements through technology and
business process automation would help − which should help continue to reduce costs. So there's not any quick
wins out there that are going to reduce us significantly. But it's just the continued focus on – by our leadership and
management teams to make sure that we're driving our expense dollars more sufficiently as we can.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
If I could just push on that a little bit. I think in the deck you say there's $5 million of savings coming from this
branch optimization. The one-timers [ph] were call it 27 (27:58). How do I wrestle with that kind of earn-back
math? Is there something I'm missing in that strategy, like I would've expected a little bit more to fall, I guess, to
the bottom line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, most of this was from real estate, this redisposition, right? So the reality is I think it's something
less than a five-year earn-back. It's still longer than we would anticipate normally. But nonetheless, we think was
the right – these were properties which are problematic. Around 20 pieces of property in total. About half of those
were in the branch [ph] world (28:29), but very small branches. So again, something like more or less than a five-
year earn-back, a little longer we'd like it to be but appropriate for us, particularly given the [indiscernible] (28:40)
we had to reinvest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Great. And then maybe I could on credit. I think I'm getting some questions about what's the pace of
reserve build. You guys have, I think, been viewed as very, very good on credit [indiscernible] (28:54) history is a
little bit more chunky, but overall, you kind of put them together, pretty good credit. How do we think about – I
guess two questions, the pace of build based on your economic forecast and also how you view the kind of a
normalized charge-offs for this pro forma company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think we're in a good spot and that we really never released a lot of the excess reserves we carried in
through from COVID. We're continuing to put up a pretty severe economic scenario through our model. So it's
difficult for us to sit here today to think about a more adverse scenario coming through in reality.
So we think provisions limited to portfolio changes and growth. And in terms of charge-offs, I think we've had a
good run. I don't know what normalized charge-offs looks like in going into next year or what the economy may
provide us. But I do think we have significant amount of coverage. The PTE book that came over from [ph] SMB
(29:51) is a 2% to 5% reserve against that book. So I think that will also go a long way in offsetting incremental
provision expense associated with the merger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's helpful. But the reserve at [ph] 98 (30:04), how do you view like the fully loaded reserve with the 5% mark
in [ph] SMB (30:13)? What's the real metric you guys are tracking internally as like in terms of coverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
[indiscernible] (30:17). So if we think about the entire – the $102 million of additional discount and credit of overall
1.4% number.

Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Chris.

Operator: Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. David, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. My question – first question here is related to funding loan growth. And loan growth,
you've got a pretty decent expectation for 2023 with the potential for some deposit outflows. How do you look to
fund that growth? It looks like securities, you'll get a little bit there, but that may not close – fill that whole gap.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So we have opportunities in the mortgage book, in the indirect book, and have liquidity in those forms in addition
to the investment portfolio. We also have a lot of wholesale funding capacity. And that said, we are still out there
fighting hard for deposits and we're going to work hard to maintain those levels. And as we go through, we grant
it's going to be a tough environment, but we're certainly not giving up and we're out there playing offense. So the
combination of those three items is how we're going to fund it. We're confident we have enough liquidity to make
sure we support that commercial team and the growth of that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. I think we're defending our deposit base quite well and the ones and getting more aggressive where we
have to. And you saw some of that repricing happening this quarter consistent with the rest of the industry. And I
still feel confident in our ability to raise deposits. Deposit gathering is a large component of the goals in every one
of our lines of business. And we're adding net new clients in every business. And so, I feel confident in our ability
to raise deposits as we need them, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right, great. And then, you gave some commentary around the deposit service charges and the changes
in some of the – your products there. Is the fourth quarter number, it's a little over – is that the right run rate? Is it
fully baked in or is there still a little bit more out of that to get to the right run rate into the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. The service charge line has more than just the NSF fee items in there. It is only one month of the NSF-
related changes have been baked in there. But I think if you look back at sort of a couple quarters average, it's
probably a better view of – you look at Q3, would be a better view of sort of more stable business and type of
service charges.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And then just to sneak one last one in here. On the operating expense guide, $939 million.
Appreciate the color there. But I know you say it depends on the revenue side of the equation, but what are you
assuming or can you talk about what you're assuming on the incentive compensation to get to that $939 million
level, and how that impacts the revenue side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So $939 million, that would include incentives, really, at target as opposed to above target. Obviously, we were –
we benefited from a really great year this year. And so incentives were significantly higher this year relative to
what we're projecting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
It's consistent with the revenue expectations we all have laid out, right? So if revenue goes up significantly, then
clearly, we have some more incentive opportunity. But given the revenue outlook we provided you and the
expense base, that goals are consistent with each other.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q

Question for you guys on loan growth. Brendon, you've made a comment and I think I got it right. But some of the
fourth quarter production puts some pressure on the pipelines, but you still expect decent growth. What are you
guys seeing in the pipelines? Is it slowing? And what is your view on the cadence of growth? Do you expect
continued strong first and second quarter growth and it slows later in the year? Just give us your thoughts on that.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Well, I'll start and Jim Sandgren can add a little bit, Jon. I think we feel good about – certainly, the pipeline coming
down is a reflection of three really strong quarters of loan growth. And there normally is a little bit of reduction of
pipeline in Q4 so that's normal seasonal reduction. So when we think the pipeline is at a level that can provide the
growth that Brendon laid out, mid-single digits for full year 2023. And the short-term still is good. I mean, as much
as there is mixed signals out there in the economy, our C&I clients are still strong. They're a little more cautious
than they were before. But there's still – their business is solid and strong and the balances are good and they're
still investing.
So CRE has slowed a bit. The interest rate environment has suddenly brought down the pipeline there. So we
expect a less robust during 2023 there. Jim, I think it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Banking, Old National Bancorp
Well I think that's really well said. I think our C&I customers actually feel pretty good about things. They're
cautiously optimistic and continuing to invest. So we'll see how that plays out the rest of the year. And to Mark's
comments about CRE, obviously interest rates are causing pressure on pipelines there. But we'll stay close to our
borrowers and have opportunities to do the right deals with the right clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. You also mentioned deposit price and exceptions and deposit specials were a couple of comments
you made earlier. Can you talk about how prevalent that is and kind of what you're doing there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
So we have special pricing and about 15%, 16% of our non-time deposit customers right now. So now, client by
client, we're negotiating. We have given our teams tools to price as they need to to stay market competitive and
retain deposits. And as Brendon mentioned, we have a number of promotional specials in every line of business
to raise deposits from money markets to CDs to the new checking account promotion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Brendon, you talked about [ph] $1.1 billion (36:45) in cash flows on the securities portfolio over the next 12
months. What kind of uplift do you think you're going to get on those repurchases – on the new purchases and
give us an idea of what you're interested in buying and kind of the duration on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
A lot of those cash was actually reinvested right into the loan book. So the lift is [indiscernible] (37:05) the runoff
yield moving into being loan yields that are north of 6% today. So a meaningful uplift on those cash flows as we
think about NII going forward.

Okay. And then, Jim, you'll love this one, but do you feel you're done with, first, Midwest, both sides, the merger,
things are tracking well, and any appetite whatsoever to be back in the M&A market? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
From a systems perspective, there's not a – [ph] the project officially (37:41) concluded. I think the reality, though,
is we're continuing to look at ways to get better at what we do both in the back office and the front office. And then
we're spending an awful lot of time on culture. Leadership teams spent the last year really building a strong
culture together. And now, we're continuing to find ways to drive it deeper and deeper in our organization. So that
work's going to take years, Jon, to continue to complete. But I feel really good about where we stand.
And in fact, we joke with ourselves. I'm not sure we could have painted a better picture of how we come together
as two organizations, two large organizations coming together. And so I feel really good about that. Obviously, the
results, we feel great about the results given all that went on this year. And so that couldn't actually feel any
better.
With respect to the next opportunities to come along, we'll continue to have active conversations and dialogues.
But I can tell you, it's not top of mind for us to think about wanting to do something right now. But nonetheless,
these are long-term relationship building activities we're going to continue to engage in. And those will be
important to our future. At the same time, we have an obligation to our shareholders to make sure whatever we do
is really disciplined and shareholder-friendly. So we're going to stay focused on organic growth and building out
our teams with new talent. And then if the right partner comes along and it's the right fit and timing for us, we'll
take a look at it. But there's a lot of ifs in there before we think about doing our next partnership.

Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just want to go back to the expenses just on I'm kind of crystal clear
on it. So the $900 million launching point, that's a core number but the $939 million expectation includes – it looks
like about $9 million of items that are not included in the starting point from the $14 million tax credit amortization
and the $5 million of property optimization. So would more kind of apples to apples expectation be $930 million for
2023? In other words, if you were to hit this guide, would you call the adjusted 2023 expenses $930 million?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We would call it $925 million. We'd exclude the entire tax credit amortization. So it'd be $925 million of the apples
to apples. I know analysts treat that differently. Many of them [indiscernible] (40:16)

Okay. So $925 million is kind of the underlying projection in there. Okay. Good. And then the – I appreciate that
clarification, Brendon. And then when you talked about the 24% core FTE tax expectation for full year 2023, does
that include or exclude tax credit benefits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Brendon, the $1.1 billion that's coming off the bond book, I think you alluded that you probably
will shrink the bond portfolio and put it into the loan book. I guess a question on how much of a remix we should
think about for this year? Ultimately, I'm trying to get at two things. The level of borrowing that you're going to
have to do and your ultimate [ph] comfort (41:28) with the loan-to-deposit ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, we're comfortable with letting the loan-to-deposit ratio increase from here. I think we have plenty of room.
We have plenty of wholesale funding capacity. I think how much of that – how much of the borrowing is –
borrowings are uses for loan growth will be a function of how effective we are at the mechanics of stable deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But the goal is roughly stable deposit, right?
