Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, and welcome to our earnings call. Joining me this morning are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. Gary will discuss the asset quality and Vince will
review the financials.
Today, I'll touch on our 2020 financial highlights, review last year's accomplishments and wrap up with a
discussion about our strategic objectives. We will then open the call for questions. First, I'd like to highlight and
wrap up with a discussion about our strategic objectives. We will then open the call for questions.
First, I'd like to highlight some key metrics from our 2020 financial results. Despite substantial challenges resulting
from the pandemic, management took significant actions to protect our employees and preserve shareholder
value, implementing measures to improve efficiency and increase profitability as we navigated the pandemic.
Looking at the fourth quarter, FNB reported operating earnings per share of $0.28. And operating return on
tangible common equity increased to 15%, building on the upper quartile returns relative to peers through the first
nine months of 2020.
Turning to the income statement for fiscal year 2020, FNB reported record total revenue of $1.2 billion, operating
net income of $314 million and operating earnings per share of $0.96, while building significant credit reserves to
address economic risk associated with the pandemic. These profitability levels resulted in strong internal capital
generation, driving our tangible common equity and the CET1 ratio to the highest levels in decades and
increasing tangible book value per share by 5% to $7.88.
Because of our performance in the prudent risk management culture, FNB continued to pay an attractive
dividend. Our portfolios continue to expand with full-year average loan and deposit growth of 11% and 14%,
respectively. This growth was due to the resiliency of our bankers and the success of the Paycheck Protection
Program, with balanced contributions across our legacy footprint and added growth in our Southeastern market.
Our leadership team prioritized a number of financial objectives during fiscal year 2020 designed to drive long-
term results. Reflecting on the 2020 operational initiatives we laid out in last year's letter to our shareholders, we
made significant progress towards those objectives in spite of a difficult operating environment. We set out to
deliver peer-leading returns on tangible common equity and drive internal capital generation and growth in
tangible book value per share.
Our 2020 return on average tangible common equity of 13% and 5% growth in tangible book value continued to
track above others in the industry. Sustaining this trajectory through execution of this strategy should increase our
relative valuation over time compared to peers. In tandem we're delivering this financial performance in a
challenging environment. We set out to protect our attractive dividend, while optimizing capital deployment.
For the full year, we paid out $165 million in cash dividend and repurchased nearly $40 million of stock under our
current stock repurchase program, returning over $200 million directly to shareholders. From a capital planning
perspective, we've now surpassed our previously stated target and completed the adoption of CECL, both leading
to enhanced flexibility to optimize capital deployment in this environment.
During the second half of the year we took significant steps to enhance future risk-adjusted returns through
prudent balance sheet action, notably the auto loan sale in November, reducing exposure to COVID-19-sensitive
industries and the prepayment of higher-cost liabilities. These actions reduce overall credit risk, reduce future
interest expense and provides us with more liquidity moving forward.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
In the fourth quarter, we resumed the inaugural FNB share repurchase program after activity was halted in the
first quarter due to uncertainty related to the pandemic. When considering the total capital consumed by the
dividend, and share buybacks and bonds, we are pleased to report an increase in year-end capital levels.
Approximately 25% of the total shares repurchased were below tangible book value, resulting in accretion to that
metric.
The overarching goal of our organization is to grow revenue by prudently increasing our loan and deposit
portfolios, all while maintaining superior credit quality and FNB's risk management culture through the cycle.
During a difficult operating environment, many of our teams exceeded loan and deposit origination target, while
improving our funding mix through a focus on bringing in low-cost deposits.
As a proof point, loans continued to grow, even when excluding the impact of PPP and the auto loan portfolio
sale. On the deposit side, in addition to an improved deposit mix, noninterest-bearing deposits surpassed $9
billion to end the year as a percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits – our percentage of noninterest-bearing
deposits increased to 31%, up meaningfully from 24% five years ago. FNB is in a very strong liquidity position
with a loan/deposit ratio of 87% to fund future loan growth, to strengthen capital and enhance liquidity.
Diversification and growth in our fee-based businesses, namely, capital markets, mortgage banking and wealth
management contributed significantly to our record total noninterest income levels. Our fee-based businesses had
an outstanding year, with many groups setting all-time records for revenue.
In 2020, capital markets, mortgage banking and wealth management achieved revenue of $39 million, $50 million
and $49 million, respectively. The strong performance was driven by increased contributions due to our
geographic expansion strategy and providing value-added solutions to borrowers. We continue to look for ways to
diversify our fee income streams by executing on strategic initiatives such as growing the Mezzanine Finance
group and enhancing FNB's debt capital markets capabilities. Total operating noninterest income exceeded $300
million in 2020.
Through our continuous investment in both our digital and physical delivery channels, we aspire to provide our
customers with intuitive and efficient solution to meet their banking need. On the digital front, adoption rates from
mobile banking users have increased exponentially in 2020 attributable to 18% growth in new users added to the
platform in the last nine months.
Looking back over the last five years, we have now consolidated 111 branches, opened 12 de novo branches in
attractive market and expanded our ATM capabilities to exceed 800 locations. These actions enable FNB to
optimize our overall footprint with limited disruption for our customers. We have diligently invested in technology
and risk management infrastructure by upgrading platforms in the retail bank and improving the customer
experience. We continue to evaluate our distribution network regarding consolidation efforts as we announced 21
consolidations to take effect in 2021.
Building on FNB's strategy to grow its market presence, particularly in metropolitan Baltimore and Washington
D.C., we entered an agreement with Royal Farms, a regional convenience store operator, that enables us to
connect cash distribution services with a robust online and mobile banking offering, providing convenient access
to essential banking products and services throughout a broader geographic region, with the deployment of more
than 220 ATM locations in the Mid-Atlantic region. In addition to withdrawals, transfers and balance inquiries,
several of the Royal Farms ATM will also feature check and cash depositing capabilities to provide customers
with even greater flexibility and increased access to broader product offerings.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
As evidence of successful execution of our growth strategy, according to the most recent FDIC data, we
experienced deposit growth in 50 of 53 MSAs across our footprint. FNB achieved top five share position in nearly
half of those MSAs, further illustrating our ability to compete effectively in our market against a broad spectrum of
competitors.
Additionally, we strive to continue to manage costs and improve efficiency. This is evident by FNB achieving our
stated 2020 cost savings goal of $20 million. In addition to achieving the 2020 target, FNB also achieved it's
roughly $20 million cost target in 2019. When including a plan to reduce an additional $21 million in expenses
during full year 2021, in total, this amounts to more than $60 million of expense reduction over the three-year
period. Because of our proactive expense management initiative, our efficiency ratio remained at a good level at
56% despite pressures on net interest income in a challenging rate environment and continued capital investment
in technology. Our strategy is proven through varying cycles, as evidenced by the solid performance and
continued focus on improvement in many key asset quality metrics.
To expand on this topic, I'll ask Gary to comment on credit quality. Gary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Our credit portfolio continued to perform in a satisfactory manner
in the fourth quarter. And we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio as we move into 2021. Our key
credit metrics showed improvement across a number of categories, after we took steps during the quarter to
proactively reduce exposure to borrowers most impacted in this COVID-sensitive environment which drove a
reduction in the level of delinquency and NPLs. Specifically, we were successful in further reducing our limited
exposure to the hotel and lodging industry by nearly 20%, which improved our position in this hardest hit asset
class that now stands at only 1.3% of the loan portfolio, exclusive of PPP loan balances.
Let's now review some of the highlights, covering both the fourth quarter and full-year results, followed by some
commentary around COVID-sensitive portfolios and deferrals. Turning first to credit quality, the level of
delinquency came in at a very good level of 1.02%, representing a 5-basis point improvement over the prior
quarter, and when excluding PPP loan volume, delinquency would have ended December at 1.11%.
The level of NPLs and OREO totaled 70 basis points, an improvement of 6 bps linked-quarter, while the non-
GAAP level excluding PPP loans stood at 77 basis points. We saw very positive OREO sales activity this quarter,
which contributed to the $10 million linked-quarter reduction for an ending OREO balance of $8 million, a
historically low level. Additionally, we were successful in moving several credits off the books during Q4 to
proactively derisk the balance sheet, thereby, further reducing NPL levels.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were $26.4 million or 41 basis points annualized, which reflects the actions taken
to strategically move the select COVID-sensitive credits off the books, utilizing previously established reserves.
Our GAAP net charge-offs for the full year came in at a very solid 24 basis points. Provision expense totaled $17
million for the quarter, ending December with a reserve position at 1.43%.
Excluding PPP loan volume, the non-GAAP ACL stands at 1.56% or a 5-basis point linked-quarter decrease,
again, due to the reductions in exposure across these COVID-impacted sectors. When including the remaining
acquired unamortized discount, our total coverage stands at 1.8%. The NPL reserve coverage position also
remains favorable at 213%, reflecting a slight improvement linked-quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
I'd now like to provide you with an update on our loan deferral levels and COVID-sensitive industry exposure. As it
relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral, 1.7% of the loan portfolio excluding PPP was under a
COVID-related deferral plan at December 31. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress during the
quarter to further reduce the limited exposure we have to higher-risk segments, including travel and leisure, food
services and energy.
On a linked-quarter basis, exposure to higher risk segments declined by nearly $90 million to stand at only 3.1%
of the total loan portfolio. A primary driver of the decrease was led by a $65 million reduction in hotel exposure,
which as noted earlier in my remarks stands at only 1.3% of our total loan portfolio. Loan deferrals in the three
higher-risk segments ended the year at only 7%, down from the prior deferral level of 29% at the end of the third
quarter.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress made during the final quarter of the year in this COVID-sensitive
environment, with our credit metrics ending at very satisfactory levels as we entered 2021 very well-positioned.
We continue to closely monitor our book and remain focused on managing risk in our COVID-impacted sectors,
as we work to further reduce portfolio exposure to these higher-risk industries that continue to face uncertainty in
the current environment. As we move into a new year, we look forward to an improving economy and the
expanded lending opportunities ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will discuss our financial results and discuss some of our current
expectations.
As noted on slide 5, fourth quarter operating EPS totaled $0.28, an increase of 8% compared to the third quarter.
Full-year 2020 operating EPS totaled $0.96, after adjusting for $46 million of significant items. While this year
brought unique economic challenges, we were well-positioned to adapt to the environment and provide strong
internal capital generation.
Vince mentioned, we increased our tangible book value per share to $7.88, an increase of 5% in 2019. Despite a
volatile year for equity markets, our combined dividend yield and share repurchases put us above peer median
level. Looking at 2021, we are confident that returning to generating core positive operating leverage on a
quarterly basis will lead to better overall performance compared to 2020.
Let's review the fourth quarter, starting with the balance sheet on page 10. Average balances for total loans
decreased 1.6% in the third quarter, largely due to the previously mentioned indirect auto sale of $500 million
which was completed in November 2020. Linked-quarter PPP balances decreased $377 million on a spot basis
as we received forgiveness for maintenances from the SBA throughout December. Commercial loans' line
utilization rate are 32%, which is about 8% or $0.5 billion in funded balances, below what we would characterize
as a normal level, creating upside for loan growth as the economy improves.
Turning to deposits, average deposits grew 2%, with 4% growth in interest-bearing deposits and 3% growth in
noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an 8% decrease in time deposits. This continued total deposit
growth provided ample liquidity and affords us the opportunity to pay down an additional $300 million in FHLB
borrowings with a rate of 2.35% during the fourth quarter. Excluding FHLB debt extinguishment from the third
quarter, a total of $715 million in borrowings were terminated during the year with expense savings that will

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
continue through 2022. As Vince noted, F.N.B. is in a very strong position to fund future loan growth, strengthen
capital and enhance liquidity.
Turning to the income statement, net interest income increased $7.3 million or 3.2% compared to the third
quarter. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 2.87%. PPP loans added 17 basis points to the net
interest margin in the fourth quarter, as the level of net interest income from PPP increased $8.8 million compared
to third quarter, offsetting 3 basis points of negative impact from higher average cash balances and 3 basis points
of lower purchase accounting benefit on acquired loans. Interest-bearing deposit costs improved 12 basis points
to 43 basis points, and on a spot basis, were down another 7 basis points to 36 basis points.
Let's now look at noninterest income and expense on slides 13 and 14. Operating noninterest income totaled $81
million, when excluding the $12.3 million loss on FHLB debt extinguishment. Mortgage banking income remains
strong at $15 million, with large contributions from the Mid-Atlantic and Pittsburgh regions. And the results
benefited from above average gain-on-sale margins compared to historical levels. For the full-year of 2020,
mortgage banking increased 57%, reaching a record $50 million.
Wealth management increased 5% from the third quarter due to the expanded footprint and positive market
impacts on assets under management. Capital markets, wealth management, mortgage banking and insurance
are businesses we've strategically invested in over the last five years, providing diversified revenue streams that
have served us well in this low interest rate environment. In the aggregate, revenue from these businesses
increased $32 million or 24% to $162 million for the full year of 2020.
Looking on slide 14, noninterest expense totaled $199.3 million, an increase of $19.1 million or 10.6%, which
included $10.5 million of branch consolidation expenses and $4.7 million of COVID-19 related expenses in the
fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $2.7 million of COVID-19 expenses in the third quarter. Excluding these
COVID-19 and branch consolidation expenses, noninterest expense increased $6.6 million or 3.7%, primarily
driven by higher production-related commissions and incentives, as well as $2 million in outside services.
Ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased 5 basis points to 7.24% compared to September 30,
2020, with net PPP loan balances negatively impacting December 31 and September 30, 2020, TC ratios by 45
basis points and 56 basis points, respectively. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the ratio decreased 34 basis
points due primarily to the PPP loan impact and the 2020 Day 1 CECL adoption impact. On a linked-quarter
basis, our CET1 ratio improved to an estimated 9.9%, reflecting FNB's strategy to optimize capital deployment,
increased over 40 basis points from year-end to 2019.
Turning to our outlook, we will offer quarterly guidance for the first quarter of 2021 and some high-level
expectations for the full-year of 2021. I'll note that our assumptions do not take into account the impact of recently
announced stimulus programs.
For the first quarter, we expect period-end loans to decline low-single digits relative to December 31, assuming
approximately $700 million of additional forgiveness of PPP loans in the first quarter. Excluding PPP and
purchase accounting, we expect first quarter net interest income to be at a similar level compared to the fourth
quarter. We expect continued solid contributions from fee-based businesses, with continued strength in capital
markets and mortgage banking, resulting in total noninterest income in the mid to high $70 million range. We
expect expenses to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter operating level.
For the full year of 2021, on a full-year basis, we expect total revenues to decline low-single digits, as top line
organic growth is offset by reduced contributions from purchase accounting compared to 2020. We would expect
7


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
loans to grow in the mid-single digits from the end of 2020, excluding impact of PPP forgiveness in that of any
new PPP originations. I'll note, this does not account for any additional government stimulus and assume some
level of line of credit utilization increase throughout the year, as the US economic conditions are expected to
improve from where we stand today.
We would expect transaction deposits excluding PPP and stimulus to increase mid-single digits from year-end
2020. We expect full-year provision for credit losses to be in the $70 million to $80 million range based on our
current macroeconomic assumptions. We expect full-year expenses to be down slightly from the $720 million
operating level in 2020, as we execute on our expense savings target of $20 million while continuing to invest in
technology and infrastructure in 2021. Lastly, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 19%, assuming no
change to the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%.
I will now turn the call back to Vince.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. Throughout the last year, we continued to focus our efforts on optimizing our online and physical
delivery channels to improve the customer experience, improve operational efficiency, as well as investing in our
infrastructure and technology. Our commitment to reinvesting a portion of our cost-savings initiative in our digital
delivery channels was instrumental in our success, serving our clients and growing loans, deposits and fee-based
businesses.
FNB will be adding a number of features to our mobile app in the first quarter, providing an improved offering to
clients. Once again, we received national recognition by S&P Global for having a top mobile application in terms
of features and functionality for banks in the Northeast regional banking space. As consumer preferences
continue to evolve, our investment in our digital platform will enable us to reach new households in our expanded
footprint.
Moving forward, we are focused on increasing the number of interaction through our online and mobile channels.
We are confident our digital offering, robust omni-channel presence and innovative customer interface will provide
multiple ways for our clients to utilize our complete offerings of FNB products and services.
Before turning the call over to the operator, I would like to thank our team for all their hard work, dedication and
determination, as we worked through one of the most difficult and challenging operating environments of our
lifetime. Their efforts resulted in a safer work environment and the preservation of shareholder value, and
positions our company for better outcomes as we move into 2021.
We expect a resilient US economy to perform at a higher level, as the effect of expected stimulus and the rollout
of the vaccine take hold, accelerating business activity and economic growth as we move through the year. We
will continue to serve our constituencies by actively engaging with communities, investing in our dedicated
employees and working continuously to deliver greater shareholder value.

Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Frank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Just wanted to ask, first to stick on buybacks, so you bought back some shares in the fourth quarter. I just
wondered how you would characterize the buyback opportunity here with shares having recovered to higher
levels. And then, also your thoughts on – I believe, you kind of thought you'd get to an 8% TCE ratio ex PPP over
the next few quarters. I wondered if there's any change to that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. Frank, I could comment on that, just from a capital perspective, as you saw in the slides, we ended the year
with the CET1 ratio at 9.9% and our TCE ratio of 7.7% excluding PPP, both good levels. And as you mentioned,
we did comment and we expect to move past 10% and 8% for half of 2021. As you know we've taken actions to
bolster our capital position to take it to these levels that are really highest for us within our kind of forecasts and
guidance to look for capital ratios to kind of gradually build from here.
And then as far as the repurchase activity, I mean, we've done nearly 40 out of the 150 programs that was
authorized in the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to be opportunistic. We think the valuation is still very
attractive at these levels. What we did buy back was reflective of the confidence and the strength of the balance
sheet, overall credit profile that we had.
During the fourth quarter, we're able to buy back 25% of those below tangible book value, which is nice from
accretion to that measure. So, I mean, we're going to be opportunistic. It's going to be a function of loan growth
and see how loan growth goes. If loan growth slows, then there's more opportunities to do that. But it's definitely
going to be a tool we have and we'll look to deploy as we go through the year.

Got you. Okay. And then, just secondly, on the expense side of things. $20 million in expense savings targeted for
2021. You guys have done a nice job paring expenses over the past few years. And so, $20 million is sort of like
par for the course actually for you guys. And I wondered if maybe there is more opportunity, given the tough –
well, given the tough rate environment, but also the acceleration in the digital channel to maybe see further cost
saves in 2021, or would any further saves likely just be reinvested? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Frank. This is Vince. Hey. It becomes more difficult. When you look at it in aggregate, it's $60 million over
three years. And I think we've done a pretty good job despite the headwinds with margin, cutting cost each year.
So, we have a process that we've actually set up inside the company to continuously look for cost save
opportunities.
So, I wouldn't rule out that we could do additional. I would say we keep looking. The timing of that cycle puts us
pretty much $20 million a year. And that's what we initially set out to do over a multiyear period. And we're well
down the path of accomplishing that. That's why we've included it in our expense guide for the year. But there's
always an opportunity to look at a number of areas within the company to drive additional efficiency.
I think, as we look at this year, we've pared back our branch network fairly significantly that was the comment – in
my prepared comments, I mentioned 111 branches. We continue to look for opportunities to pare back where we
feel we have the ability to retain customers.
I think the move with the ATM distribution, enhancing our ATM delivery channel, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic
and in the Ohio market in the last 12 months, this will help us leverage our digital channels to attract new
customers, which gives us the ability to weed out lower-performing branches, right, and not lose the coverage of
the marketplace. That's the overarching strategy.
But I would say that we continue to focus on it. Obviously, we'd love to see our efficiency ratio below 55%. That's
always been our target – was to be around 50%, hopefully, in the long run. And some of that comes with revenue
growth too. And the final half of this, I was going to tell you that we feel very confident about the markets that
we've entered.
We're seeing good success in those higher growth markets, so hopefully our growth trajectory starts to improve
as the economy improves. And we start to see outsized revenue growth contributions from those markets, which
will obviously help the efficiency ratio. We're not just focused on expense. We're focused on driving top line
revenue.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q

Got it. And then, sorry, just quickly, just want to make sure I heard Vince Calabrese right on the PPP. Did you say
that was added 17 basis points total to 4Q? And if so, just could you remind us what 3Q contribution was?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The fourth quarter was – yeah, 17 basis points to the fourth and 6 basis points to the third quarter was the
contribution.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on the loan growth; the guide, mid-single digits. Just can
you just give us some color on – it sounds like it's – I'm assuming it's going to come from your higher-growth
markets. But, on a product basis, CRE was pretty strong. And we've seen others show CRE momentum as well.
Just given the concerns there, what's driving that strength?
And then also, Vince Calabrese, you mentioned line of credit utilization is backstopping some of this. And I'm just
trying to square that with what's obviously very flush liquidity situation among borrowers. So just some little more
color on the loan growth?

...on a year-over-year basis, but the quality of the pipeline I think is better. And we spent more time sorting out
where real opportunities are. And I would also say that the pipelines in the Southeastern markets are fairly robust.
I mean, Charleston is doing exceptionally well. We expanded in Asheville, North Carolina. We're seeing some
good activity in Asheville both from a CRE and C&I perspective. The Mid-Atlantic region's still moving in the right
direction, had some growth potential.
Then our legacy markets, we're expecting to pick up in the second half of the year. They're more industrial-based
in the Midwest. And we're expecting to see more C&I opportunities. Gary, I don't know if you want to add to that.
You're seeing the book...

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You're seeing the opportunities come over.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think, as you mentioned, Vince, the Southeast has been more active than the other regions at this point,
seeing some new opportunities. We brought on a few new bankers, and they've been active. So, we're seeing
some very nice new opportunities with some new names out of those new bankers that we've brought on who are
very, very solid and experienced bankers in those markets.
In terms of the line of credit utilization, Casey, we did see it bottom in the fourth quarter. It actually moved up
about a 0.5% into the mid-32% range. So, we are expecting, as the economy improves over the next year, that in
the latter half, we will see some growth from a utilization standpoint with our industrial base. So, that's kind of the
expectation there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Keep in mind, there's a lot of cash on corporate balance sheets sitting on the sidelines. So, we're going to
have to go through several sales cycles to deplete that cash. Some of it's stimulus driven, so there's – I'd say the
second half of the year is when you'll start to see expansion on the revolvers from a balance perspective.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And appreciate the color on the PPP and the purchase accounting. Is there a way to quantify
what the contribution will be in 2021 for those items, so we can get a better sense of what the core revenue
outlook looks like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Let me go through some of pieces, because there's a lot of moving parts in there. So, for the fourth quarter,
net interest income was $234 million, right. PPP contribution was $31 million up from $22 million in the third
quarter. So, reflects that forgiveness of just about $400 million that we had and kind of updates our assumptions
for the remaining life.
So, the purchase credit deteriorated accretion that was related to CECL was $9 million, down $2 million from the
third quarter, okay, so from $11 million. So, kind of all in, if you look at net interest income, excluding PPP and
purchase accounting, we're at $195 million, which is up slightly from $194 million, so just kind of underneath this
activity.

The NIM, the other item that we had also is just cash position, right. So, the cash position will reduce the margin
by about 3 basis points. So, all of these kind of contribute to our good confidence that we're in an inflection point
for the kind of underlying NIM.
When you look ahead to the first quarter, we think the net interest income excluding, again, PPP and purchase
accounting will be relatively stable, even with the couple fewer days that you have in the quarter. The PPP
contribution, we expect to be $20 million to $25 million, assuming $700 million of forgiveness. And then purchase
accounting probably comes down another couple million to $78 million or so. So, those are kind of the key moving
parts as far as the purchase accounting and PPP.
And then, just a couple of other kind of key drivers, just for everybody, for me to touch on. So, interest-bearing
deposit costs, we mentioned in the slide, it came down, 12 basis points to 43 basis points. We ended the quarter
on a spot basis at 36 basis points, so that kind of gives us a 7 basis point head start to the first quarter. And
there's still some more opportunity there on the business deposit side.
The consumer CDs continue to roll down. We have maturities of $275 million to $300 million a month in the first
quarter. Those are kind of coming off at around 1.5% to 1.6%. New CDs are coming on at 19 basis points. So,
that continues to create opportunity on the rate paid side. And then, the new loans that we made during the
quarter, from a pure kind of coupon standpoint, came on at 3.21%, which is a basis points higher than the
portfolio yield, so that stabilization obviously helps on the loan side.
And then lastly, the reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio were 91 basis points during the quarter,
excluding some key growth that we had for pledging purposes. So, now that starts rolling off at 2.28%, so there's
a little bit of a headwind there. But I think loan yield stabilizing and new loans in relation to the portfolio helps as
well as the continued opportunity on the deposit side. So, sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to kind of go
through all those key drivers.

Got you. Okay. And just last one for me, a question for Gary. So, the $70 million to $80 million provision,
obviously, you guys have your CECL forecast. And I'm just wondering what the loss progression looks like for
2021, and where the ACL ratio lands at the end of the year with that kind of provision guide?

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Gary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Casey, we've done a lot of work across the portfolio, reviewed a lot of credit, updated a significant amount of
credit in the latter half of the year with our normal reviews that come then flush what we've done on top of that,
with the three deep-dives around the COVID-impacted portfolios.
And one of the things that we did as we mentioned, we took some actions in the fourth quarter to reduce our
exposure to what we call the higher-risk assets in those COVID-impacted sectors. And we really feel good about
the books coming into the new year.
Our reserve levels at year-end were at solid levels. Our charge-offs for the full year came in at 24 basis points.
And we feel really good about the work we've done and the position of the book. So, our expectations, as we look
forward subject to loan growth around the portfolio, is that we're expecting charge-offs to be in what we would call
normal ranges with some guide there. And we feel good about that provision guide in 2021. We have
expectations that the economy will continue to improve. So, a lot of work has gone into it. And we feel good about
the information that we have forward with you.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just sticking with the credit discussion. When you look at the guide for that $70 million to $80 million of
allowances and what we saw this quarter, how much of a qualitative overlay did you have to utilize to sort of keep
the provision where it was? And as to your comment about an improving expectation for the economy, should we
assume that, that qualitative overlay declines over the year, and that we really do see some significant reduction
in that allowance ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we – with the end of the year review of the ACL, we did utilize some qualitative overlay based on the
position of the book. That said, the majority of our ACL is quantitative, but there is a qualitative overlay. As the
economy improves, we'll continue to manage that appropriately.
The metrics that we utilize there, Jared, with an improving economy coming into play in Q4, also improvement in
unemployment, housing, GDP, as well as the markets. So, generally, we're looking at a gradual steady
improvement. Unemployment will continue to decline, and it's just over 6% in our forecast horizon. And GDP
growth's about 4% next year and 3% in the year after. So, I mean, those are some of the inputs into our ACL that I
can give you. And we feel good about the position of it at this point.

Okay. And then, on the PPP, with this second round, I know it's excluded from your guidance, but looking at the
$2.5 billion you were able to put on in the first round in that, that went on pretty quickly, where you see the second
round peaking, and when do you think we get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think, it's too early to tell. I don't feel that – I mean, I can tell you, we're running – we're at about 9% of the
total that was originated last time. And there was just a mad rush. So, I don't see that happening. I think that we'll
continue to originate. As I said, we're at $400 million roughly with 1,900 – 1,871 applications is what we took when
we cut it off last night, so and the portal had just opened. So, I would expect there to be sustained demand for the
product. And I think it's hard to say, but we won't hit – we won't be at to $2.6 billion. I can tell you that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
With that growth, is that – your loan officers being proactive and going out and letting your customers know that
the portal's there, or is it that there's sort of this organic demand for it that, that you know people sought it out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we – yeah, we've been in communication – when we originated in the first round, we captured everybody's
e-mail addresses and pertinent contact information. They were assigned to a banker physically. Every single one
of those, 19,000 or 20,000 loans was assigned to a banker of the company. And those bankers have maintained
communication.
And we've also set up a communication system via e-mail, where we update the clients periodically about what's
happening with the SBA and the PPP program. So, I would say we were pretty active with that 20,000 base that
we originated the first time.
And what we're seeing are folks that are coming back that feel that they qualify for this tranche, and they're
coming back. And so, I would say, yes, it's been managed. And it's been very fluid for us. We developed our
portal in-house. Our people did a fantastic job planning it. We monitor the changes that [ph] were going on which
were (00:48:04) constant with the SBA.
It's very complicated because there's a first draw, second draw. And we still have forgiveness going on. But we've
automated all of those processes. And when we went live, the website worked flawlessly for us so – and we're
end-to-end digital. So, I'm very impressed with what our people have done and very pleased with how easy this is
to use for the customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. And then, just finally for me on the expense side, that's great with the $20 million target. I guess,
when we look at the COVID accommodations, whether that's expenses or waived fees, should we expect that,
that is over now in 2021, or what's the tail on those COVID-sensitive expenses and COVID-sensitive missing
fees? And do you think that we get a 2021 efficiency ratio back to where we were in 2019?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
I would say that the – just couple things. I mean, on the expense side we still have some level of supplies
[indiscernible] (00:49:19) maybe it's $1 million to $2 million, just looking ahead to the first quarter at least. So,
there'll still be some level of that, just kind of given where we are.
If you look at the fee income side, you could see that on that noninterest income slide that service charges were
down about 10% year-over-year. At the bottom, it was down about 45%. So, we've definitely seen customer
activity kind of move back up. Not back to pre-pandemic levels yet, but I guess, we'll see as you go into 2021.
I think one of the key things that we're monitoring, as everybody else is, is how customer behavior changes and
evolves over time. We've done, I think, a great job of investing in all the digital initiatives [ph] like the ATM and
(00:50:02) the clicks to bricks that we have, so that customers can bank wherever they want to bank. But we're
definitely going to closely monitor the customer behavior over time to see if there are opportunities for maybe
more consolidation as you go forward from here.
And I guess, there's one other thing on expenses, too, I wanted to mention is we're – process improvement
initiatives, we've been actively working on that over the last few years and definitely looking at using some of
these robotics, the RPA initiatives, to streamline processes even more. So, we have a good number of initiatives
this year that will help the efficiency ratio. And some of that's baked into the guidance. If we can do even better on
that, it'd be the first time we're implementing some of these techniques, I think there's more opportunity there, too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And we've invested pretty heavily in the digital realm, and that includes data analytics, data warehousing, the
interface. We're adding features to our website where, today, you can purchase checking account products and
move through the whole process online digitally from end-to-end. We're adding loan products this year.
Our mobile app is going to have a picture bill pay, enhanced chat, credit score, e-statements, a new user interface
and the ability to immediately enroll in mobile through the mobile application. We're also taking the mobile
optimized website with a solution center, and that's going to be incorporated into our mobile app, so people can
actually shop on the solutions that are within the mobile app without going into a disparate website. So, there's a
lot going on.
I don't think we should lose focus on investing in those areas because that's what's kept us competitive with larger
competitors and fintechs. And I think we're hanging in there. You can see from the market share data that I
shared with you that we've done well in just about every MSA we're in, in terms of growth. So, I don't think that
battle's over. I know we're dealing with headwinds on margin, so we've kind of curtailed some of it or delayed
some of that investment, but that's still needs to be a focus.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Wanted to maybe do a quick follow-up on the expense side. So, you've got about $15 million of kind of core
expense inflation, $21 million of planned savings. And I would assume there'd be maybe a little bit of tailwind from
lower costs in the fee businesses on a year-over-year basis, and in particular, mortgage. So, maybe could you
kind of square that comment with maybe your expectations for the mortgage outlook or other fee businesses that
maybe that are going to do better in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say – I mean, the fee business has had a phenomenal year in 2020 with record levels as Vince
commented in his remarks, when we look at mortgage, plus capital markets, plus insurance, plus wealth, the $32
million increase there in fee contribution. As we said in our guide, the contributions there, we would continue to
have at very strong levels. I don't know that we're going to set a record every quarter as we did with mortgage,
when you look at mortgage last quarter, but this quarter was very strong.
Again, $15.3 million following an $18.8 million. So, we've invested a lot in those businesses. We've expanded
geographically. Particularly in the mortgage business, we think there's still more upside to come with some of the
markets and folks that have joined the team over the last year. But I think as we come through this period, that will
continue to bring more benefits to us.
On the expense side, I would say that the guide overall is kind of down slightly from 2020 levels. And the first
quarter always has – there's payroll taxes and things kind of jump up in the first quarter. But if you look at the
expenses, going out second, third and fourth quarters, you get right around that $178-ish million that we have
been guiding to which – hence, the kind of the flat guide that's in there. And that's through the cost savings, the
$20 million cost saves, as well as kind of other initiatives to improve the efficiency. So, that's kind of where you
get to, once you get through kind of the first quarter seasonal increase there.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
And I guess, my second question, kind of, is to go back to the zero interest rate environment that we had coming
out of the last cycle. I remember, at that point in time, you guys felt like it was prudent to grow more quickly early
in the cycle, while credit spreads were wider, as those would only get competed away throughout the cycle. So,
maybe just kind of an update on your view on being more aggressive on loan growth early this cycle again, and
when you'd feel comfortable kind of stepping out there and being more aggressive in that way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Our strategy has always been to be consistent through cycles. So, while we were able to grow faster and gain
better margins because of credit spreads broadening through the depth of the cycle, we were out in the
marketplace deploying capital throughout the financial crisis. That hasn't changed.
What's changed here is the trillions of stimulus that's been injected into the economy. So, I think if we didn't have
that, my belief is that FNB's credit metrics would be superior. We would be out in the marketplace originating,
while others would be retrenching or returning capital because of concerns. That didn't happen this cycle because
– I attribute it to the stimulus. It's essentially providing an opportunity for companies to work through the issues
without relying on a bank to provide additional capital. Essentially, we're providing the capital, but it's federally
guaranteed for PPP, and even in the consumer segment with these stimulus checks which are unprecedented.
That has changed the game.
So, with that, we have to be very careful about what we originate because, eventually, there will be a day of
reckoning. So, I would say, we're optimistic about the areas that we focus on. And we're continuing to deploy
capital in those areas just as we have in the most robust times. And I think we will get a benefit because I think
given the zero rate environment, borrowers have been more receptive to floors when we think about their all-in
rate. An additional 50 basis points doesn't change much. It's not even that. You've got to net out the LIBOR – one-
month LIBOR rate.
So, I think, that – well, our loan originations in the commercial segment, we're still calling aggressively, that will
turn at some point here when demand starts to pick up, and what we believe in the second, third, and fourth
quarter this year. Sorry for the long answer, but that's the view.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
No, that makes sense. And one just quick last maybe for Vince C; are there any other balance sheet actions that
can be taken or opportunities ahead? You've taken some in the last two quarters, so just curious if there's
anything else out there that we should expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say that we're always analyzing the full balance sheet to see if there's ways to improve the position.
We took a lot of action in 2020. And I would say, as we sit here today, if you look at the home loan advances,
there's about $1.7 billion or so. $650 million matures in 2021, so kind of a short life there.
So, there's another $1 billion or so that we'll continue to evaluate to see, does it make sense to potentially do that.
But we don't have any plans to do it right now, Michael. I mean, it's just kind of part of our regular evaluation and
19

assessment of the markets and the balance sheet. But, as we sit here today, we don't have any plans for any
other actions.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, Gary. Just wanted to ask, was any of the reduction in the higher- risk portfolios like the hotel due to loan
sales or was that paydowns of maybe some weaker credits that you didn't want to retain?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We moved $65 million in hotels. $42 million of the $65 million, we moved them in the normal course of
business, moving them off the balance sheet. We did sell a handful of hotels that we classified as higher risk in
that book, so it was only $23 million. And we did move some other small business related items of a similar dollar
amount. But, other than that, the majority of that was just moved off of the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Of that $23 million that you sold, was there any charge-offs that were tied to those sales?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The total amount that we moved, including some of the small business stuff was right at $50 million, Brody.
And in terms of charge-offs, the charge-offs on that book were $6 million. And of that, we had that totally reserved
for going into the sale, so it was provision-neutral. So, it was a very good [indiscernible] (01:00:21).

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this bit. Could you give us a sense for how criticized and classified loans trended
this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, the classifieds were down $50 million, and the criticized were up just a touch over $100 million, criticized
being special mention. So, we had good movement in classifieds; slight increase in the special mention category.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. All right. Maybe just turning to new loan originations. Appreciate the color on the pipeline, but just wanted to
get a sense, Vince, for what new C&I and new CRE yields are like today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're getting – I mean, Vince can maybe give you more detail, but on originations, I can answer that. We're
running in the probably 2.50% range, right, spread?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The spread is up about 45 to 50 bps over midyear. So, we are seeing improvement from a spread
perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And as I said earlier, I think the floors move down a little bit, right. We were seeing 75 bps, now we're seeing 50
bps. So, there's a little bit of competition. There's a lot of competition out there. But, in particular, in focusing on
the floors, we're still able to get them not at the same spread that we would've gotten at the beginning of the
crisis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. Is that spread over LIBOR or, I guess, what's the benchmark?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Gary's talking spread over LIBOR.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Right. Understood. And then, the liquidity ticked up again, which you deployed some of that in the
securities. Is that a strategy we should expect more of or would you rather sort of hold off and use that to fund
loans moving forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Oh, it'll be a combination. We're monitoring that every day to decide kind of which way to go. We have been
letting the securities portfolio run down earlier in the year. And we did put some good portion of the cash flows
that came out of that portfolio, we reinvested in the fourth quarter. And kind of the plan right now would be to hold
securities flat in 2021. But, again, that's subject to change as kind of rates move around.
Liquidity is there. We've used some of the assets to pay down some of the borrowings. As we said, we'll continue
to evaluate that. And then, additional stimulus is just going to bring more deposits into all the banks, right. So, I
think, that the plan there would be, as Vince commented earlier, as you get through the year, and you get the
vaccine behind, and hope that economic activity picks up, and the customers work through cash, and then they
start to borrow again to utilize that liquidity. So, we'd like having the powder. And I think our teams are very well-
positioned. They're actively calling on their clients, as well as prospects, so that when that time comes, I think,
we'll be right at the table.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And what are new security yields right now, Vince?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
They're around – I want to say around 100 basis points, really pretty low.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then just – I wanted to ask the outlook for capital markets. Are you expecting some of your
middle market customers to get more active throughout the year, or is there not as much of a need just with so
much liquidity on balance sheets right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. I think that there'll be opportunities for us to continue to execute in capital markets realm. As we move through
the year, particularly in the second half of the year, I think that there'll be more activity, and our borrowers will
want to take advantage of the low rate environment. So, it will lead to opportunities, as we start to fund debt. From
a working capital perspective, we're not fixing tranches of embedded working capital. We're focusing principally
on term borrowings. So, that doesn't really come into play frequently.
But from a CRE perspective, that's still an active area. I would expect us to continue to see decent level of capital
markets opportunities. And our syndications areas, both CRE and C&I, are reloading their pipelines. So, I think
M&A will pick up in the second half of the year again. And we're also forming a – we're in the final stage of
22

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
completing the formation of a broker/dealer to take advantage of debt capital markets fees for our large corporate
borrowers. That's a move that we made, so that should help us as well this year. That will be finalized shortly, and
we'll be able to accept these debt offerings for our clients as we have done at this point, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you for that. Just a couple quick ones left. On your insurance business, just wanted to ask how
much of that is related to individual policies, or is there a commercial insurance component to that as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's pretty small. The individual piece of it is relatively small. It's mostly commercial. It's employee benefits and
your typical risk-based policies for commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just on the expense outlook, appreciate the guidance. But you're on in this a little bit higher than
where your guidance would imply right now. So, I just wanted to get a sense for if you could walk us through, I
guess, maybe some of the timing as to when the expense – that core expense number would run down and get
you closer to a sub-$720 million level for the full year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, just couple points. I mean, the fourth quarter expenses are a little bit higher, as we commented
on, kind of production-related commissions and incentives are in there. We typically have some of that at the end
of the year, kind of true everything up based on how do you close out the year. So, that's in there.
There's a couple million-dollar increase in outside services. Professional fees related to a variety of projects that
we have going on, where we brought in some outsiders to help with things like LIBOR and a whole list of projects
that we had proposed, kind of helping out with. So, that's really not kind of run rate as you go forward. There's a
couple million dollars in there for that. Our FAS 91 [FASB 91] deferred origination fees were about $1 million
lower, so that increased the expenses.
So, there's a lot of moving parts to kind of the fourth quarter, which is why my comment just a little earlier ago
was, if you look at the expense run rate kind of second through fourth quarter, once you get through the seasonal
blip, we're right around the $178 million that we ended talking about for a couple of quarters in there.
So the $20 million initiative is a lot of – I mean it's all identified, and a lot of it's in place. Most of it starts within the
first few months, I would say, so that you get that kind of run rate benefit. But the $20 million is inclusive of the
various timing of those initiatives as we go through the year. But most of it's pretty early, as we would expect, so
that we get most of the full-year benefit of those expense savings.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. No problem.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Most of my stuff's been answered. Just a couple things. Could you guys just comment.
I mean in the past, you guys have been pretty adamant about M&A was off the table. But with activity maybe
picking up this year, just if you could give any thoughts on how you're thinking about it, if it's still – really the focus
continues to be organic growth or is there some consideration you could be opportunistic on M&A this year if
activity does pick up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would definitely say that while we're experiencing good success with our de novo expansion and the
rollout of our digital platform more globally, I think, there's opportunities. I mean, we're going to do whatever
makes sense for our shareholders. If there are opportunistic transactions, we'll look at them. I think that – one
thing for sure though is that we're going to look for something that doesn't compare tangible book value
substantially, so the earn-back would have to be relatively short. And as from our past M&A activity, our board is
adamant about EPS secretion, significant internal rates of return, some capital invested and earn-back, so those
will be key elements.
And I do think as we moved through, we've made significant investments in our platform, in our systems in our
infrastructure assets, which I think will be daunting for smaller banks. So, I do think there will be opportunities to
take cost out and to merge with – or acquire smaller organizations that provide some decent accretion, in some
instances, may be accretive to tangible book value and capital. So, that's where we are. Thank you for asking the
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. And just the – in your thought, Vince, would this be probably in-market deals, I guess, is what it sounds like,
rather than entrants into new markets, the way you look at it today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, there's still work to do within the franchise. We're spread across pretty broad geographies, so
there's plenty of opportunities to do in-market acquisitions, and that would be the priority. But obviously we can
take significant amount of cost out with overlap. We've been the shrinking branch delivery channel with the rollout
of more digital capabilities.

So, I think, that, coupled with our ability to roll out additional ATM sides across our footprint, kind of bridging the
gap. We're out to 800 with branded and owned ATMs. So, we have a pretty substantial network. That goes hand-
in-hand with our ability to originate customers, both digitally and through the physical delivery channels. So,
obviously, within that footprint, is much easier to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then, just the last two for me. I guess, the other Vince. Vince, appreciate the color on the
PPP. Did you give what the remaining unearned fees to collect are at this point before the new program kicked in
here? Just kind of what's left as we go through the balance of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Brian. I have that. It's – at the end of the year, we are $32 million of remaining unaccreted fees. You may
recall, it was kind of $82 million to start with the program. And there's $32 million that's left to come in that we
would expect to – virtually, all of it to come in during 2021, kind of depending on the pace of forgiveness.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then last one for Gary was just – the color on the criticized and classified level, I mean, Gary,
do you feel like – and then I guess, it sounds like from your outlook, I guess, would you anticipate that fourth
quarter levels are maybe a peek in the criticized and classified levels based on kind of review of the portfolio and
the better macroeconomic outlook? Is that kind of how you're thinking about it today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say that's an accurate view at this point, Brian. Naturally, the economy is going to play a role there. If we
get a continuing improvement throughout the year from here, yeah, I would expect that to play out. Naturally,
you're going to have a credit or two move from a rating standpoint, so that's going to temporarily move the
number. But I think, we are at an inflection point there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then, that utilization you talked about, kind of trending back up maybe in the back half of the
year. I guess, can you get back to pre-COVID levels, or do you just think it's going to get maybe partway back, if
things kind of unfold as you guys look at them today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think it's going to be a slow grind forward with increased activity in the latter half. I would not expect it to
get back to a normal level by year-end 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

Yeah. Thank you. I really appreciate the interest and the questions. I thought they were great questions.
Hopefully, we were able to provide transparent answers, so you guys can complete your modeling.
And again I want to thank our employees one more time. I think it was a very challenging year. We worked as
hard as possible to preserve shareholder value and to position this company with success. I can't say that
enough. I mean, there were a number of management action that took place that weren't easy decisions, but we
made them. And we're well-positioned to move into next year. And we're looking forward to a return to normal.
So, thank you, everybody. Appreciate the interest. Take care.
