Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch on a few highlights before I hand it over to Emily to
review our third quarter financial results, and she'll give you the outlook for the remainder of the year in more
detail as well.
Our financial performance this quarter reflects healthy and broad-based organic growth across our businesses as
well as the supportive global markets backdrop.
Now, if you refer to slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we reported EPS of $1.04 and generated a
return on tangible common equity of 17%. Revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year-over-year; and fee revenue was
up 6% year-over-year, and that would have been 11% if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers.
This fee growth included almost 3% of organic growth across our franchise.
During the quarter, we returned roughly $2.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, including almost $300 million of
common dividends and $2 billion of buybacks. Our continued focus on innovation has led us to announce several
groundbreaking new solutions this quarter that will meaningfully improve the client experience and represent
exciting growth opportunities for us.
Let me start with Asset Servicing. In the third quarter, we continued to see strong sales momentum. Year-to-date,
wins are up almost 40% versus a year ago, and we are winning larger, more complex deals that span our product
offering as clients increasingly see the value we can provide across the value chain. We had a number of exciting
business wins this quarter. But one example I'd like to highlight is the work we're doing for Oak Hill Advisors, a
leading alternatives investment firm.
Oak Hill was receiving fund admin services from one of our competitors and performing middle office functions in-
house. Due to our deep expertise and our ability to offer them a seamless solution across multiple services, we
were able to win both mandates. This mandate is a real testament to our differentiated capabilities and the
strength of our alternatives servicing platform, which is seeing very nice fee growth this year of 10% plus. And we
remain excited about our ability to scale this business and the growth opportunity for us ahead of us.
We also continue to see good momentum in ETF servicing where, year-to-date, we have already helped clients
launch more funds than during all of 2020. And then, in our Data and Analytics business, our capabilities continue
to resonate with our clients. This quarter, we signed two additional large asset manager clients to our next-
generation data management platform or what we call the Data Vault. And another large global asset manager
went live, bringing the total number of clients signed up or mandated to the Vault to six. And we're also thrilled
about an extension of our partnership with the Florida State Board of Administration as they look to leverage our
ESG Data Analytics app into their full investment cycle for 30-plus funds spanning about $250 billion in assets
under management.
Now, moving on to Markets and Wealth Infrastructure businesses. Pershing had another good quarter, and it was
on the back of continued organic growth in accounts and new client assets. Over the last 12 months, Pershing

generated over $100 billion of new assets despite the headwind of the few clients lost to consolidation that we
previously mentioned.
To give you just one example of our differentiated capabilities and the power of our broader interconnected
franchise, a multibillion-dollar Wealth Management client recently approached Pershing for a strategic partner that
can provide a broad set of integrated solutions. In a collaboration between our Investment Management, our
Wealth Management and Pershing businesses, we designed a series of risk-based models and turnkey
investment solutions that are more cost-effective, tax-efficient and portable for the end investors. This innovative
solution, combined with our leading custodial services and technology, made Pershing the provider of choice. But
we're not resting there.
This past week, we announced the launch of a new business unit within Pershing, which we're calling Pershing X.
This unit will deliver the industry's leading end-to-end platform in the wealth advisory space, offering a
comprehensive set of advisory capabilities and helping financial services firms solve the challenge of managing
multiple and disconnected technology tools and data sets for their advisors, fueling our clients' and, therefore, our
growth.
Today, we're already the leading provider of custody and clearing services. And by adding front-end capabilities,
Pershing will become uniquely well positioned with RIAs in the broader wealth tech segment to capture share in
one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services.
I'm also thrilled to welcome Ainslie Simmonds to BNY Mellon, who will lead this effort for us. Ainslie has been a
transformative leader in the advisory space for 20 years. She has extensive experience across wealth
management and digital, and she has helped launch several successful fintechs. Pershing X is one of our most
ambitious multi-year projects to-date. The combination of our planned investments and the talent that we've
recruited, combined with the leading platform that we already have, will meaningfully enhance Pershing's future
growth profile.
In Treasury Services, we continue to see healthy growth in payment volumes on the back of an improving global
economy and net new business. In September, we announced that Verizon has become the first corporate client
to roll out BNY Mellon's innovative real-time e-bills and payments functionality to its customers.
Now, we've spoken about this a few times, about the capability in the past, and we're just incredibly excited about
its future. We see enormous opportunity across our client roster as more retail banks enable their customers to
receive and pay e-bills via the real-time payments network. As some of you have seen, CEOs from 23 of the
largest banks in the country, including myself, signed a letter committing to bring these capabilities to the market.
And we expect that 40% of digitally enabled US consumer accounts will eventually have this functionality by year-
end.
With over 15 billion bills paid annually within the US, many of which are still paper-based, this ecosystem is ripe
for disruption, which our innovative capability is built to address at scale. And we are uniquely positioned in the
market as we don't compete with other banks in consumer banking or card issuing. As a result of our leadership in
the space, we were recently recognized by The Banker as the Best Transaction Bank in Payments. It's a real
honor and we think it's just the beginning, so a lot more to come in the space.
Turning to Clearing and Collateral Management, the business continues to benefit from the higher collateral
management balances. In fact, they reached a record $5 trillion at one point this quarter. Outside the US, we are

seeing growth as clients continue to migrate from bilateral to tri-party. And domestically, recent growth has been
driven by the elevated utilization of the Fed's reverse repo facility, where we are the sole clearer.
Globally, we continue to implement new capabilities that allow clients to more efficiently mobilize collateral
interoperability between our US and international platforms and vice versa as part of our Future of Collateral
program. Additionally, this quarter, we were the first bank to add Agency MBS as collateral on overnight cleared
repo transactions, and these are done via the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's new general collateral-
sponsored repo program. This new capability expands the universe of clients that now can indirectly transact with
central counterparties as well as the scope of eligible collateral. And by sponsoring these transactions, we help
our clients reduce costs and free up capital that could not otherwise be available on a bilateral basis.
Last but not least, the recent deadlines for the Phase 5 of non-cleared margin rules really differentiated us in the
market and has validated the multi-year investments we've been making in automation and client experience.
While many across the industry really struggled and were ultimately unable to repaper all their counterparty
relationships in time to go – to meet these go-live deadlines at the end of September, BNY Mellon was lauded for
having a more streamlined process for client onboarding experience and for having digitized and automated the
collateral schedule negotiation and amendment process. Once again, our automation has enabled our clients to
do things better, faster and cheaper.
In Markets, client volumes remain very strong on the back of continued organic growth, offsetting the headwind of
lower volatility. This quarter, we also rolled out several enhancements to our LiquidityDirect platform that gives
clients additional short-term investment options. Clients can now seamlessly invest their cash in commercial
paper and ultra-short duration fixed income ETFs, and also now have the ability to select money market funds
based on their ESG investing criteria and preferences, leveraging our ESG Data Analytics app. While still early
days, client feedback so far has been extremely positive.
Pivoting to our Investment and Wealth Management business, in Investment Management, we saw our sixth
consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products. And our initial suite of eight index ETFs, including the
industry's first true zero fee ETFs in the largest equity and fixed income ETF categories, now exceeds $1 billion of
AUM and is growing quickly. And we recently launched our first active ETF, the BNY Mellon Ultra Short Income
ETF, sub-advised by Dreyfus.
On the 1st of September, we successfully completed the transition of almost $200 billion of Mellon's AUM and
over 2,000 client mandates into Insight and Newton, as well as the integration of Mellon's cash capabilities with
Dreyfus to drive further investment specialization at scale.
This realignment positions us to better meet clients' needs, it creates greater scale, and it enhances the
differentiation in the value proposition of our investment firms. Not only are we pleased with the timely completion
of this project, but the feedback from clients and consultants has been very encouraging, and we have
experienced virtually no client attrition during this transition.
And finally, in Wealth Management, the business continues to execute on its clear three-pronged strategy to focus
on client acquisition, expand the investment and banking offering and invest in technology to drive efficiency.
Year-to-date, we've acquired about 40% more clients than over the same time period last year, and the average
size of our new clients is up by over 20%. The business saw another strong quarter of net inflows and continued
growth across lending and deposit products, and our investment performance remains strong.

And so, in summary, we're intensely focused on driving innovation across the franchise. In fact, we were recently
named among Fast Company's 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators, a testament to our forward-thinking culture
and our continued investments in our people, technology, efficiency and growth. We're pleased with the continued
pickup in organic growth, and we're continuing to make the investments necessary to drive further growth and
efficiency.
So, with that, I'll hand it over to Emily.

Emily H. Portney
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.
Starting on page 3, total revenues grew by 5%, reflecting higher fee revenue, partially offset by lower net interest
revenue and higher money market fee waivers. Fee revenue grew by 6% or 11%, excluding the impact of fee
waivers. This reflects the positive impact of higher market values, strong organic growth and the favorable impact
of a weaker US dollar.
Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $233 million in the quarter, an
improvement of $19 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by slightly higher average short-term interest
rates.
Other revenue was $129 million and included roughly $55 million of valuation gains on strategic equity
investments. Net interest revenue was down 9%.
Expenses increased 9% or 6% excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves, a notable item this quarter, the
impact on which you can see at the bottom of the slide.
Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $45 million, primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic forecast,
including an expectation for a continued recovery of commercial real estate prices.
EPS was $1.04. Higher litigation reserves negatively impact EPS by $0.06, and provision benefit had a $0.04
positive impact this quarter. Pre-tax margin was 29%.
On page 4, we see the trend across a few key metrics over time.
On to capital and liquidity on page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above regulatory
minimums and above our internal targets. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding constraint, was 5.7%,
down approximately 30 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the return of $2.3 billion of capital to our
shareholders, partially offset by earnings and a 1% quarter-over-quarter reduction in average assets.
We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.7%, down 90 basis points compared to the end of the second
quarter. Finally, our LCR was 111%, roughly flat compared to the prior quarter.
Turning to page 6 and further details on net interest revenue. NIR for the third quarter was $641 million, down less
than 1% sequentially. The impact of lower interest-earning assets and continued pressure on reinvestment yields
was partially offset by lower premium amortization, the benefit of a full quarter of higher IOER and lower deposit
and funding.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Turning to page 7 for some color on our balance sheet. Average deposit balances declined by 2%, or
approximately $6 billion sequentially. This is as we continue to work with our clients to pursue off balance sheet
alternatives for their excess cash. This decrease in deposits drove an approximately equal sized reduction of our
average cash held at central banks.
The size of our securities portfolio remained flat quarter-over-quarter. Average loans increased by about 1%
sequentially and 14% year-over-year with growth primarily driven by margin loans, secured loans to global
financial institutions, collateralized loans in Wealth Management and growth in capital call financing.
Turning to page 8. As I mentioned earlier, expenses of $2.9 billion were up 9% year-on-year. Excluding the
impact of the notable items that I also mentioned earlier, expenses were up 6%. Almost two-thirds of this increase
was attributable to revenue-related expenses, and the remainder was evenly split between incremental
investments and the unfavorable impact of the weaker US dollar.
On to page 9 for a closer look at our businesses. Investment Services reported total revenue of $3 billion, up 3%
year-on-year on higher fees, partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers. Excluding the
impact of fee waivers, fee and other revenue was up 10%.
Assets under custody and/or administration increased by 17% to $45.3 trillion, roughly half driven by growth from
new and existing clients and half driven by higher market value.
As I discuss the individual Investment Services and businesses, I'll focus my comments on the fee revenue for
each business. In Asset Servicing, we saw strong growth despite the impact of fee waivers. That's on the back of
higher market values and client activity, as well as higher FX revenue. Fee waivers impacted growth by roughly
400 basis points.
In Pershing, fees were also up nicely, reflecting higher market values and continued underlying organic growth,
offsetting the impact of lost business and waivers. The waivers impacted fee growth by approximately 500 basis
points.
In Pershing, clearing accounts were up 4% and mutual fund assets were up 23%. Net new assets in the quarter
were up $7 billion. Excluding the impact of the deconversion of clients lost to consolidation that we have
discussed previously, net new assets in the quarter would have been roughly in line with the second quarter.
In Issuer Services, fees were down and included a roughly 600-basis-point impact on fee growth from waivers.
The resumption of issuance activity and seasonally higher dividend payments in DR were offset by a decline in
Corporate Trust fees.
In Treasury Services, healthy fee growth on the back of improved economic activity and net new business
resulting in higher payment volumes was offset by approximately 700 basis points from fee waivers.
Lastly, Clearance and Collateral Management fees were up, primarily driven by growth in non-US collateral
management balances and higher clearance volumes, partially offset by lower intraday credit fees.
FX revenue across all Investment Services increased by 17%, driven by higher client volumes as we're winning
new business and growing with existing clients. This was partially offset by lower volatility and spreads.

Page 10 summarizes the key drivers underneath the year-over-year revenue story for each of our Investment
Services businesses.
Now, turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 11. Investment and Wealth Management reported
total revenue of $1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher market values, valuation gains on
strategic equity investments, the benefit of the weaker US dollar, and increased performance fees, all partially
offset by higher fee waivers.
Excluding the impact of fee waivers, fees and other revenue was up 18%. Assets under management grew to
$2.3 trillion, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows and the favorable impact of the
weaker US dollar, principally versus the British pound.
In the third quarter, net inflows totaled $14 billion, driven by LDI and cash strategies. As Todd highlighted, the
business has now seen its sixth consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products.
Investment Management revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by higher market values, equity income and gains
on strategic equity investments, the benefit of the weaker US dollar and higher performance fees. Fee waivers
negatively impacted revenue growth by 650 basis points. Wealth Management grew by 10%, primarily driven by
higher market value. Client assets reached $307 billion, up 16% year-on-year.
Page 12 shows the results of the Other segment.
I'll conclude with a few remarks about the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our guidance on NIR based on
the current forward curve remains down 14%, compared to 2020.
Also, using the forward curve, we expect fee waivers in the fourth quarter to be roughly in line with the third
quarter. With regard to fees, excluding waivers, given growth in the third quarter exceeded our expectations and
given the continued momentum across the franchise, we now expect fees ex-waivers for the full-year to be up
closer to 8.5%.
On expenses, we continue to expect the full-year to be up about 5%, excluding notable items. And we also expect
our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%.
And then, lastly, with regards to buyback. Given we ended the quarter 20 basis points above our management
target for Tier 1 leverage, the fact that we continue to have excess deposits that we expect to recede over time,
and based on our expectation for continued strong capital generation, we intend to once again return capital well
in excess of 100% of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe
Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Emily.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Good morning, Steven.

Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Wanted to start things off with just a question on the NIR guidance, Emily, that you just gave. I was hoping just to
unpack the guide for 4Q, specifically, what you're assuming in terms of deposit and balance sheet growth, liquidity
redeployment and, I guess, last and certainly not least, premium amortization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, why don't we, first, just start with the third quarter? In the third quarter, NIR was down very, very
modestly. That was off the back of lower reinvestment yields, also lower interest-earning assets as we worked
with our clients to actually manage especially excess deposits. We were able to offset that with some tweaks in
the securities portfolio. And also, we did see a benefit from premium amortization coming down that was both a
mixture of us reducing the size of our MBS portfolio as well as the fact that prepayment speeds did slow down
quarter-to-quarter.
Our full-year guide, as you just rightfully pointed out, remains at down 14% for the full year. In terms of kind of
what's baked into the fourth quarter, look, I think we have more or less hit the trough. What's baked in there,
certainly, we'll still have the impact of lower reinvestment yields as a headwind. We are expecting a further
reduction in interest-earning assets, because we will continue to work with our clients in terms of managing
excess deposits. So, perhaps, we expect them to go down by about $5 billion to $10 billion.
With respect to premium amortization, it's likely – our expectation or forecast based on rates is that it will be pretty
much flat fourth quarter to third quarter. And look, there is probably some upside. I mean, certainly, based on
what we're seeing in terms of volatility in rates and even some movements like, for example, the Bank of England,
et cetera, so there could be some upside.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, that's great color, Emily. And just for a follow-up on expenses. I was hoping you could speak to the expense
growth outlook. We've seen a number of upward revisions to the expense guidance over the course of the year.
And just want to gauge whether the current level of expense, it's about $2.85 billion ex the litigation cost, is the
right jumping off point for 4Q. And maybe just longer term, what level of expense inflation we should be
underwriting on a more normal basis, just given the continued investments you cited in the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, within the quarter, so yes, expenses overall up 6%. We're still guiding for the full-year expenses to be
up 5% versus last year, obviously, ex notables. When you unpack the third quarter, about two-thirds of that is
attributable to what we call revenue-related expenses, inclusive of an uptick in higher incentives. We obviously
want to pay our people competitively and for the strong organic growth that we are seeing. About a third of that is
split evenly between the impact of the weaker US dollar as well as the incremental investments that we have
pulled forward. So, those are the investments in both – in growth, in infrastructure as well as efficiency.
It's worth mentioning that in the third quarter, we are starting to see an impact of a tighter labor market, both in
terms of competition and in terms of costs. And also, in the third quarter, there was an impact of a merit increase,
which took effect in June.
As we kind of look out, it's certainly too early to really comment on 2022. We're in the middle of the planning
process. What I would say is that, yes, the uptick you're seeing in the second half of the year is really the jumping
off point for next year. And ultimately, there are other headwinds as well. Inflation, as I just mentioned, look, we're
seeing – it's a good thing, but return to more normalized travel rates, so T&E is likely to go up. And as we reopen
the offices and return to the office, there'll be some additional expenses associated with that.
Of course, we will continue to also achieve and identify efficiencies. We're working through the investment spend
as we speak, going to the proverbial food fight because as always, there's lots that we want to do. But what I
would say is we're intensely focused on expense management. We will continue to be focused on expense
management. But we're also going to invest through the cycle. And if I were to just give some color, I would just
say that expenses in 2022, if I'm standing here today, will be modestly up from 2021.

Hi. Well, this is a good timing because I wanted to follow up on the food fight investment spend discussion. So,
software costs were up 8% year-over-year. And Todd, you started off talking about some fintech-like initiatives.
And so, I'm just wondering if maybe next year, you want to spend more money. I mean, there is this tough trade-
off that you have in delivering results and investing for what you think could be a good effort. I didn't fully
understand when you were talking about Pershing and the transaction banking payments, so maybe if you could

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So, Pershing X is, I think, an exciting opportunity for us. And so, if you think about the registered
investment advisor business, so if you think about Pershing, we're really the largest correspondent clearer. So,
we're a third-party clearer for broker dealers in the retail space and now registered investment advisor. And that
business is actually growing, but it's not growing nearly as fast as the advisory space is growing.
And so, we are the custodian. We are the clearer. We are providing a lot of the back-end services for that
business. But we think there's the opportunity for us to be an integrator in that business. So – and it's been
growing. I haven't looked at the number recently, but it's been growing at a ballpark of 15%. So, we think that –
and we've got a relatively small market share for it, Mike. So, we think there's an opportunity for us to pick up
market share in a fast-growing segment. So that's why it's so exciting to us.
In terms of the challenge that Pershing X will solve, if you think about it, advisors have these multiple technology
tools, a bunch of different data sets that they're trying to integrate or trying to look at. Oftentimes, they're logging
into multiple systems, and they're really reducing the advisory productivity. And that would be across things like
financial planning, investment modeling, even some banking activities. And we have the ability to integrate our
own private bank. So there's really no solution out there today that can tie that all together.
And so, that's what we mean. It will be an open architected but an end-to-end solution. So, we'll be integrating
best-in-class services amongst some of our own, and it'll provide a digital capability and real good retail
experience, both to the advisor as well as to the investor itself. So, that's our target for Pershing.
I think your other question was around the e-payments. So, in e-payments, this is – we – this is using The
Clearing House's Real Time Payments system, and we were the first to actually connect. And now this is a
request for payment from a client – excuse me – our clients, so Verizon, to their customer.
And they send – come across your – they'll come across your phone that your bill is ready. Here is your bill, press
this and make the payment in real-time or you can even – you can set a time when you want to make that
payment to make sure that you've got funds in your account.
That will connect as more and more banks connect to the Real-Time Payments system that broadens the
capability of covering a very large percentage of the market. Currently, there are about 15 billion payments made
in the US. So, it's an enormous market and we've got some – we've got about 100 prospects showing significant
interest in the capability we designed.

Okay. So, e-payments, big initiative, big opportunity. Pershing X, if I heard you correctly, big market, big
opportunity. So, in terms of funding these initiatives, as far as investing in these areas, specifically or more
generally, I know you've done a lot of overhaul in the back office, a lot of overhaul with your tech talent, what sort
of spending will this take and should you be going faster or slower, or how do you decide that?

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we – so, as you know, we've been increasing our tech spend over the past few years. A lot of that,
as you pointed out, was in infrastructure and resiliency and building a sounder infrastructure to support the growth
that we're looking to drive today. And so, it's kind of the peace dividend from that, we are reinvesting in a number
of the – in software and the app dev that we've talked about.
So, I kind of categorize it into three areas. One is, we've talked about our initiatives. I mean, we just talked on two,
Pershing and Treasury, but we've got some very neat things going on in our Data and Analytics capability. We're
digitizing things across the bank. The Wealth platform, we continue to invest in for our own Wealth Management
activity. Corporate Trust, we're using smart contracts and developing a digital network for our clients to operate
on.
And Investment Management, we're – so just about across our businesses, we continue to invest, invest in
technology. There's also ongoing infrastructure and risk management. I mean, our cyber defenses are not cheap,
and we need to continue to invest in them. We're doing a significant number of cloud conversions as I think
through across the company. Regulatory reporting requirements continue to go up. There's a liquidity requirement
as well as complying with the LIBOR requirements. And we will always be focused on data and resiliency.
And then, on the efficiency side, there's – we've actually inventoried the number of things that we do manually.
And we're looking to knock them out for automating when it can create some significant efficiencies and risk
reduction. And we're also looking to modernize some of our core apps. So, even in our Treasury Services, we're
putting a very modern payments app – engine underneath all of this. So, there are a lot of – the good news is
there are a lot of opportunities, but it will come with some costs. And our intent is to increase our technology
spend next year.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Todd, can you – or Emily, when I go back to the year-end 2019 pre-pandemic size of your balance sheet, you
guys had assets about $382 billion and deposits of $259 billion, let's call it. And then, you had deposits at the Fed
of $95 billion. Obviously, today, it's considerably higher. When the Fed finishes quantitative easing, assuming it's
finished by next summer, can you kind of frame out for us what you think your balance sheet might look like as we
go forward? Are customers going to be pulling deposits out? Do you think it will shrink down? Not that you'll ever
get to that year-end 2019 level, but should we start to think about a continued falling on the size of the balance
sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I'm happy to take that, and Todd certainly can chime in. So, the way we think about deposit levels now, we
probably still have around 10% to 15% of our deposits are excess, and they will eventually recede in a more
normalized rate environment. But actually core deposits overall are also up, just given the growth in AUC/A, et
cetera. So, I mean, the core deposits are also up, but the excess is about 10% to 15%. And the way we've been
looking at it is, certainly, we've been kind of managing the growth in those deposits and very successfully so, so
kind of very – in a targeted way looking at what we deem to be excess and working with our clients to pursue off-
balance sheet alternatives for those particular balances.
And as the Fed begins to taper and we all think they will begin to taper soon, I think that does help in terms of kind
of putting a lid to a degree on the growth of deposits from here. In terms of kind of what we expect kind of in, I
guess, kind of 2023 and beyond, yes, I think that you're at a stage where the Fed actually hikes on multiple
occasions, it's kind of only at that point that we would probably see a decline in deposits. But the core itself is
higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And Gerard, I think if my memory serves me right, Gerard, that date was – you were picking an end date. It was
actually the averages were a little bit lower than that. So, there is a significant amount of excess. It will start to –
and that's why we're sitting on so much cash at central banks. And we'll probably see a little less pressure
certainly for deposit growth when the Fed starts to taper. But to Emily's point, the excess coming off is probably
sometime thereafter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Correct. They were period-end numbers. Good memory. The follow-up question, you guys had a very robust
share repurchase amount this quarter, as Emily pointed out, of $2 billion and just guided for the fourth quarter.
The question is, if I recall correctly, you have a $6 billion program that I think expires at the end of next year. If
you reach the $6 billion prior to the termination date, would you consider re-upping – assuming, of course, your
capital ratios permitted, would you consider re-upping the buyback if you use it all up before that termination
date?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
The answer, Gerard, and if you think about the stress capital buffer regime has actually made things a little more
flexible for us. And so, certainly, the board recognizes that if we continue to produce the capital that we're likely to
and we buy back the excess capital that we've accumulated, we'll be in a position to come back to them and ask
for more. So, the answer is yes.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just one on Issuer Service fees. They were flat sequentially. And typically, you'd have
some seasonality. I think you mentioned some weakness in – on the Corporate Trust side. Is that just pushed
out? Should we expect some rebound in 4Q? Just how do we think about the trajectory in that business? And any
more detail on the quarter would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, in the Issuer Services, you really do have two businesses: Depositary Receipts and Corporate Trust, as
you point out. Within DR, we definitely saw a resumption in both issuance and dividend activity, and that was
really even on top of the normal uptick that we see in the third quarter. In Corporate Trust, the underlying
business actually is performing really well. Volumes in structured products are up actually meaningfully, slightly
offsetting a small decline in activity in munis.
But the third quarter for Corporate Trust, there were really 2 things that also impacted revenue. So, one was a
decline in reimbursable expenses. We've got reimbursable expenses that are just a pass-through. And ultimately,
so that impacts revenue, does not have any impact whatsoever on PTI. And also, there was a discontinuation of a
public sector mandate that started in this quarter, and you'll – we'll see the full effect of that in the next – in the
fourth quarter, will probably be another $10 million or so decline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. And – but no, nothing got pushed into 4Q? It just was those issues?

Emily H. Portney A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. And just maybe on the payments business. I think it's kind of an interesting push. You've already had some
growth in Treasury Services. So, maybe you could just talk a little bit of what's been driving the accelerating
growth of late. I think it's a little too early to be expecting anything from these new initiatives. And then, I guess, as
we think about the new initiatives, like this Verizon deal and others potentially, is that a first-mover advantage type
thing? I guess, how do you defend being the intermediary between the merchants and the banks? Is it just simply
being the first-mover advantage, so -and what you think the possibility from a revenue standpoint could be from
that business? Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, this is – so, a couple of things there. So, effectively what we're doing is we're digitizing their
collection experience. So, we've been in the lock box business, and now we're converting that to electronic to
these requests for payments. And it is faster and cheaper for the provider, so the cost actually is for the utility in
this case. So, the cost to them on a per-unit basis is down dramatically, and you also reduce float and other items.
So we think it's usually to their advantage. So, we happen to have the collection relationship.
And we can continue – the paper is not going away. That's going to be a component of it. So, we can provide the
complete solution. So, we just thought we happen to be in a very nice position to do this. And we're not in the card
or retail payments business to speak of in between it. So, we happen to be very well positioned, and we got a little
bit of a first-mover advantage by being into The Clearing House's Real Time Payments system right away.
In terms of how big can this grow, it could possibly move the needle a little bit, and add a little something to our
organic growth. I think it's a little too early to tell. We're excited about the relationship that we've got with Verizon.
We're excited that this certainly stirred up a lot of interest. And we've got a pretty reasonable pipeline. But I just
prefer at this point not to speculate on what that could be, perhaps.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Would like to explore the really robust core fee revenue growth
that you guys have seen here. Todd, you made reference to a nearly 3% organic growth rate in the quarter, which
is really quite good. So, is it possible to break down the year-to-date or your expectations for 2021 in the different
components? How much of it came, you think, from organic? How much activity and volume related? I seem to
recall that in the past, you've said that half of your servicing business is market-sensitive. So, is that still the right
way to calibrate when we think about the market impact or pricing dynamics? Is it possible to give some color
around the composition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Sure, Brennan. So, I think, first of all, we should probably help you understand what we're describing as
organic. So, we do try to take the market impact out for interest rates and the equity markets. We also try to
adjust, for example, for some of the unusual activity that came for example, right now, money market funds are
very large because of all this excess cash. Deposits are very large because of this excess cash.
So, we try to knock that growth out of the calculation. And when we knock all of that out, because if you look at us
growing, our revenue growth minus fee waivers is significantly higher than what we're talking about in terms of our
organic growth, because that's getting the benefit of some of the market considerations.

So, once you knock all of that out, the numbers get to something like 2.5% or so for this year, which is much
stronger than what we've seen in years past. And frankly, three years ago, it was probably zero, maybe even
slightly negative.
Emily, you want to kind of march through some of the areas where we're actually seeing it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
In organic growth, sure, I mean, the – and just to really break it down very clearly. So, the 11% in fee growth ex
waivers we saw this quarter year-on-year, 3% was organic growth, as Todd alluded to, about 6% of that was just
market – was market impact and the remainder was just impact of a weaker US dollar.
In terms of the organic growth in that 3%, it was really broad-based. So, when you look at Pershing, I think we
talked a bit about continued growth in clearing accounts, mutual fund balances and net new assets. In terms of
Treasury Services, we saw good growth in terms of payment activity. And on the back of both stronger economic
– a stronger macroeconomic backdrop, but also net new business. And also within Treasury Services, we've
really shifted the product mix to be higher margin in that business.
In Asset Servicing, wins are up 40% year-to-date versus what they were last year. So, that, too, is just speaking to
the organic growth in that business. In FX, volumes were up significantly, and some of that's market, but a lot of
that, too, is just based on investments in the FX platform that we've made. So, it's really broad-based and strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Excellent. Thank you for all that color. And Emily, I'd like to explore some of your – I know it's very early to talk
about 2022, but the expectation around expenses next year, a few questions on that. Would that modest growth
be on a constant currency basis? And when we calibrate, I think you also had said that the back half of 2021 is a
decent base in which to build off of. Is that excluding the litigation that you guys had? And if so, could you size
that for us? And when we think about modest, is there any way to calibrate that? Like, would you consider the
2021 expense growth to be modest, or is it a bit more significant than that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, in terms of – it's a bit early to really comment on 2022. We're obviously going through the entire planning
process, as we speak. As I did mention earlier, the uplift in expenses that you're seeing in the second half of this
year, on the back of the investments that we are making, is structural. So, those are permanent and that really will
be baked into next year.
As I also mentioned, there are some headwinds. We're starting to see a bit of inflationary pressure. Like I said,
we're going to return to more kind of normalized, we think, travel, and so T&E will likely go up. A bit of extra
expense associated with return to the office. So, there are headwinds that, of course, we're going to be looking to
offset with efficiencies. So, I wouldn't want to put an actual number on it. But at this moment, I would say
expenses for the full-year next year will be modestly up. And that's just on a top line basis. They will be modestly
up versus this year.

Hi. Good morning. I wanted to start by just asking you to talk a little bit more about Asset Servicing. It had really
good underlying growth if we just keep sec lending aside and fee waivers aside. And the deck mentions
transaction activity and higher market levels. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand, like how did the
Collateral business act versus how did the core Asset Servicing act and what type of a net new wins quarter did
you see on both sides. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, Emily, why don't I take the Clearing and Collateral Management business and you can take the rest of the
Asset Servicing space? So, we saw good growth in the Clearing and Collateral Management business as we
have for a while now. In fact, one of the points I made in my remarks, for the first time, we saw the Collateral
Management numbers, our tri-party numbers exceed $5 trillion in the quarter. So, we continue to see good growth

there. And the profitability on the global Collateral Management continues to be strong. We've got innovation that
is paying off there. So, that attributed a bit to the growth.
The other thing that we're doing, and we do this out of our Markets business, but it's really a Collateral
Management business, is the requirement to meet margining for over-the-counter-derivatives transactions to meet
margin requirements. And we're in Phase 5 of 6 of that. And our teams did an excellent job of seamlessly
onboarding a significant number of players. And that's starting to add a little bit of revenue to the line there. So,
overall, that business continues to look pretty healthy and continues to show underlying organic growth.
You want to comment on the rest of Asset Servicing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. As you think about Asset Servicing and just thinking about just the growth in our fees or – sorry, our AUC,
our assets under custody, they are up about 17% year-on-year on a spot basis. About half of that was driven by
market. And the other half truly driven by growth, both from growth from existing clients as well as new clients,
probably split about 50/50. And when just thinking through kind of where we're seeing a lot of that growth, about
30% of it is from investment managers. Another 30% or so is from broker-dealers and banks. And then, the
remainder is really split between both the alternative space and the asset owner space. So, that's – we're seeing
a nice uptick in the pipeline, it's stronger than it was in this period last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is just coming back on the clearing business, last quarter, you had said that
you had expected about a $20 million impact from the deconsolidation that you discussed. Can you just help us
understand how much of that was already out in the third quarter? And how much more do you still expect, if any?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. In Pershing, we had originally expected about a $20 million impact of the lost business due to just being on
the wrong side of M&A. That is due to timing that was a lot less. So, I would think about it as the uptick will be
about $15 million between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we'll see the full impact.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just to follow-
on on a couple. So, just going back on to the organic growth, obviously, this is really tracking well going from
zero-ish to now close to 3%. So, maybe just a thought, I know 2022 is too early, but given these initiatives that
you have and how you think about the revenue following through, do you – are you optimistic that you can
continue to improve upon that 3% number?

And then just one on Pershing X. Just in that aggregator system, does that require you to disintermediate that
current custodian, or are you becoming the custodian in that process, or rather, would you sit on top of the current
custodian and make it – have a seamless aggregation of their technology services?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So, why don't I take the Pershing question? And then, Emily, I think you can probably handle the other one.
But the Pershing project X will be multi-custodial, so it will be actually be custodian-agnostic. Of course, we'd love
to have a custodial business. But we'll be able to provide these capabilities regardless of who the custodian is,
and we're working on that capability right now.
And I must – I have to say this is going to – the Pershing, in particular, is probably the longest in term of our
investments, so this, we're really investing for the future. And I think before we really start to see the revenues that
we expect in that business, that's probably two or three years out. Most of the other ones that we've been talking
about are a little more near-term.
Do you want to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Again, we're in the middle of the planning process. So, it's probably too soon to really comment on the
expectations specifically for organic growth next year. But certainly, we're really pleased with the momentum that
we've seen this year. And we would hope to certainly achieve roughly the same amount of organic growth next
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great. And then just quickly on net interest revenue on that 14% down guide. I'm not sure if I had the
right base here, but does that imply a slight downtick in NIR in 4Q versus 3Q? I know Emily you said – you talked
about the trough. And I wasn't sure if you're referring to 3Q or 4Q as the likely trough in NIR.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, if you do the math, it would imply a very – a slight downtick about 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter.
But, of course, rates are moving all the time. Like I said, we're seeing potential upside from some central banks
even moving earlier than originally thought. So, that's what – based on the last forecast, it's slightly down. But we
think there's potentially some upside and hopefully it will be flat.

Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, I mean, certainly, when we look at the entirety of our wins were both new wins of what we call new business,
it can be new business from completely new clients as well as new business from existing clients. So, as clients,
obviously, launch new funds, et cetera, that's still a new business, but it's new business with existing clients. And,
of course, we're always very, very focused on retention. So, having the business already and still competitive – it's
competitive out there, so making sure that we're retaining those deals that we already – that we – where we are
the incumbent. When you look at it, about – it's about 50-50 in terms of the breakdown from like new versus just
retention of existing business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And we're – and I think, to your point, we're definitely winning against the competition and a couple of the ones
that I even called out today, one in the alternatives space that was a different service provider. We had a broader
set of capabilities in addition to the ability to do the administration. So, we've won that business. We won a couple
large businesses over the last – takeaways over the last couple quarters. So, occasionally, we lose them. But
right now, our win-loss ratio versus the competition is leaning toward our side. And we think that's because of the
capabilities that we've got as well as the quality of the service that we've been delivering.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Thanks. And just to stay on retention, how is the retention rate been trending? And then, what kind of
opportunities or things can you do to continue to improve the retention rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Our retention rates have been trending upwards, and we don't really disclose. But certainly, they're trending
upward, and they're very high. So, well in excess of 70%, 75%. So, in terms of how, I mean, the first thing I would
say is, first and foremost, is just client service and basically performing well day-in and day-out. And that's what

kind of gives you even the right actually to bid and to ultimately retain. So, we're intensely, intensely focused on
that.
And then, of course, it's about talking to our clients, understanding their strategy. More and more, we're really
working in a consultative manner with our clients, looking at their issues, their challenges and how we can bring
the solutions of our – the entirety of the firm to bear to help them with their operating model and to get more
efficient and to create alpha. So, it's both just being good at the day-to-day and also ensuring that our capabilities
and both our capabilities and our products are not only competitive, but leading edge and then working with the
client – working with our clients on a very – in a consultative and in a strategic manner.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Brown with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you, operator. I'm not sure if you guys gave this, but Emily, just given most of your comments are on
a year-over-year basis, I was just curious, given the move in the dollar and the strengthening that we recently
saw, what was the sequential impact to revenues and expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter
from the move in the dollar?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Oh gosh, off the top of my head, I can't really – I don't have it off the top of my head. But, I mean, the good news
is, is that actually we're pretty equally matched. So, any benefit you have in revenues or any – sorry, any
headwinds you have in expenses is pretty much equally offset in revenues from us. So, from a PTI perspective,
we're incredibly well-hedged.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's going to be in the ballpark of 1% to 2% of the expense base (sic) [year-over-year].
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, of the expense base, yeah.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, just on the loan book, it's up 14% year-over-year, the average loans, but just 1% sequentially,
and that's the lowest growth rate we've seen in the last three quarters. Any particular reason there was a bit of a
slowdown this quarter and what's the expectation there going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, I mean, just to point out, our loan book has grown by 14% year-on-year. So, there's been very healthy growth
in the loan portfolio over time. Of course, growth in any one quarter can be lumpy. We did see some healthy
growth. Loans on a spot basis, they're actually up more than – they're up to $64 billion. Some of the growth we're
seeing is a growth in margin loans, growth in collateralized lending in Wealth. We're seeing growth in our term
loans in terms of securities financing and also more demand in terms of capital call facilities. So – and look, we do
think we have certainly – we're proactively looking to grow the loan portfolio. And we're very – we feel that it's
certainly an area that's in focus, and we've got capacity certainly to do so.

Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to
