For the next few minutes, I'll discuss HTLF's highlights for the quarter, then turn the call over to Bryan McKeag,
Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and financials. Also joining us today is Nathan Jones,
Chief Credit Officer, who can answer questions regarding the stable credit quality across our portfolios.
The HTLF board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the company's common
stock, payable on November 29, 2023. The board also approved a dividend of $175 for Series E Preferred Stock,
which results in a dividend of $0.4375 per depositary share payable on January 16, 2024. For more than 40
years, HTLF has increased or maintained our common stock dividend each quarter. This is a direct result of the
strength, insight and growth we consistently provide to our customers and shareholders.
In the third quarter, HTLF delivered solid loan and deposit growth. Our credit quality remained stable. And in
October, we successfully completed the final conversion of charter consolidation. For the quarter, net income
available to common stockholders was $46.1 million and earnings per share of $1.08. Charter consolidation
expenses reduced EPS by $0.04. We delivered on our balance sheet guidance from last quarter's earnings call
and are pleased with the results.
At the end of last quarter, we said we were going to grow loans, grow customer deposits, and pay down
wholesale funding. We accomplished all three of those things. From the linked quarter, consumer deposit growth
was $152 million or 1%. Total loan growth was $154 million or 1% and was almost fully funded by our customer
deposit growth. And we paid down wholesale deposits and borrowings by $367 million. While we did that, we also
lowered expenses with core expenses decreasing $3.3 million or 3% from the linked quarter.
Let's start with deposits. Our deposit base is diverse and granular. Customer deposits are diversified by both
geography and industry with no industry concentration higher than 10% across our portfolios. In the third quarter,
customer deposits increased $152 million. 90% of the growth came from commercial and small business and 10%
from consumer. While we maintain a favorable deposit mix, customer demand accounts decrease slightly to 33%
of customer balances, which reflects the ongoing but slowing transition to interest-bearing accounts. Wholesale
deposits and borrowings were reduced by $367 million from the linked quarter, which was made up of a $715
million decrease in wholesale deposits and a $348 million increase in borrowings. Overall, total deposits for the
quarter decreased to $17.1 billion. 64% of total balances are insured or collateralized.
Turning to loans, in the third quarter, we saw continued strength across our commercial loan portfolios with
increases in each. From the linked quarter, non-owner occupied real estate increased $126 million or 5%.
Construction increased $16 million or 2%. Commercial and industrial increased slightly while owner occupied real
estate increased $31 million or 1%.
And our ag portfolio also increased slightly. In total, commercial and ag loans grew $176 million or 2% from the
linked quarter in line with our guidance. In the third quarter, we added 269 new commercial relationships,
representing $253 million in funded loans and $95 million of new deposits. 81% of new commercial loan
originations have variable rate structures flat from the linked quarter and a 12% increase from the prior year. Yield
on these new originations increased 27 basis points from the second quarter.
Our commercial pipeline remains strong at over $1 billion. It's distributed across our regions with strength in the
Mountain West and Southwest. While we added more than 2,800 consumer relationships in the quarter, our
consumer loan portfolio decreased $7 million or 1% from the linked quarter, while residential mortgage decreased
$15 million or 2%. We expect total loan growth of $150 million to $200 million of core loan growth in the fourth
quarter, which we again expect to substantially fund through customer deposit growth. In addition, we expect
seasonal ag line utilization of $100 million that would be paid down in the first half of 2024.

Turning to key credit metrics, our disciplined credit approach is delivering stable credit quality across our
portfolios. Delinquency ratio remained low at 12 basis points, nonperforming loans declined $11.6 million to 44
basis points of total loans, nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained flat at 33 basis points,
non-pass-rated loans decreased $32.6 million, and net charge-offs declined to $3.7 million, some of which had
previously been reserved in prior quarters. This included $1.3 million from the sale of our $10 million consumer
credit card portfolio.
Market conditions have been applying additional pressure on the commercial real estate office market across the
country. We feel good that our office exposure is low at 3.6% of our total loan portfolio. We continue to place
emphasis on targeted reviews of our portfolios and recently conducted an in-depth review of each office credit
over $1 million. We believe our portfolio is well constructed, granular and generally situated outside of central
business districts. We continue to enhance our ongoing portfolio management surveillance and refine how we
screen new opportunities for underwriting. For more on our CRE office exposure, please see page 16 in the
Investor Deck.
As I mentioned at the top, earlier this month, we completed the final conversion of charter consolidation. All our
local bank brands are now divisions of HTLF Bank, and we're now able to serve all our customers anywhere in
our footprint. The nearly two-year project was completed on schedule and on budget, driving greater internal
efficiency while we continued to deliver external growth. We are now strategically and structurally positioned for
our next phase, HTLF 3.0, to execute on new initiatives that leverage our brand, products, technologies and
capabilities.
While we remain focused on continuing to achieve organic growth, we are also focused on reducing expenses,
increasing EPS, and growing TCE over the next few quarters. We continue to evaluate our balance sheet and
capital structure to maximize efficiency and flexibility. And we're analyzing our expense structure, including
geographies, branch footprint, management layers, and span of control. We expect some one-time expenses
associated with these initiatives, and Bryan will have more details in his comments. We will provide more on
HTLF 3.0 during our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
We're investing further in our strategy and innovation and have added to our executive leadership team. Robert
Kahn is our new Chief Strategy Officer; and Zach Hamilton, our new Chief Innovation and Digital Officer. Both
Robert and Zach will help drive HTLF's continued growth and evolution and help us further differentiate ourselves
in the products and services we bring to our customers.
HTLF is delivering and executing on our strategies. Customer deposit growth, quality loan growth, stable credit
quality, and we're driving long-term efficiency. This is all made possible by the hard work and dedication of
HTLF's employees. We're committed to delivering strength, insight and growth to our customers, communities,
shareholders and each other. Together, we are HTLF.
I'll now turn the call over to Bryan for more details on our performance and financials.

Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. As Bruce just described, HTLF performed well in a challenging environment
this quarter, reporting earnings per share of $1.08 with loan growth of $154 million, which was with loan growth of
$154 million, which was fully funded by the increase of $152 million in customer deposits. Reported quarterly
results included charter consolidation, restructuring costs of $2.4 million, which reduced EPS by $0.04.

In addition, net gains and losses on investments and other asset sales and write-downs were low at a net loss of
just over $200,000. Before I go into more detail, I want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings release
and investor presentation are both available in the Investor Relations section of HTLF's website.
So I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which was $1.5 million. The provision reflects our
stable credit quality, including a reduction of nearly $12 million in nonperforming loans, lower charge-offs at 12
basis points of total loans, and a continued low delinquency rate of 12 basis points of total loans. At quarter-end,
the total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance on loans and unfunded
commitments, decreased $2.1 million to $127.7 million, or 1.8% of total loans.
Moving to the rest of the balance sheet, Bruce has already covered loans and deposits, so I'll start with
investments. Investments declined almost $300 million during the quarter to $6.4 billion, representing 32% of
assets with a tax equivalent yield of 3.79%. Due to the increase in mid to long-term interest rates in our quarter-
end, the unrealized loss on our available for sale portfolio increased $129 million to $747 million.
The relatively small held-to-maturity portfolio of $835 million or 13% of investments has an unrecorded, negative
fair value mark of $77 million. The available for sale portfolio has a modified duration of just under 5.4 years.
However, the hedges we have placed on $840 million of our longer dated municipals and agency-backed,
secured, mortgage-backed securities reduces the effective duration to just over 4.6 years.
Moving to liquidity, HTLF's liquidity profile at quarter-end is strong and stable, with $1.2 billion of principal cash
flow coming off our securities portfolio over the next 12 months with $240 million expected next quarter; second, a
low level of outstanding borrowings and $3.1 billion of available capacity with the Fed and FHLB; third, we have
several Fed fund borrowing lines and broker deposit sources that remain open and available; fourth, our customer
deposit base is granular and well-diversified with over 64% of total deposits either insured or collateralized.
Fifth, our loan-to-deposit ratio is 69% and when removing all wholesale deposits, it remains low with 80%. Cash
and unpledged available for sale securities totals $3.9 billion. And lastly, the holding company cash position
stands at over $300 million, which is over 3.5 times our current annualized interest and dividend payments. In
addition, our dividend payout is relatively low at 28% of current EPS.
With regards to capital, regulatory capital ratios remained strong with common equity Tier 1 at just over 11.4%
and total risk-based capital ratio of nearly 15%. Adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments, these ratios
remain well above capitalized levels at approximately 7.25% and 10.75%, respectively. The tangible common
equity ratio decreased 13 basis points to 5.73% at quarter-end. The decline in market value of investments was
partially offset by an increase in fair value of swaps this quarter, resulting in a net decrease of 35 basis points that
is attributable to the accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI.
Moving to the income statement, starting with revenue, net interest income totaled $145.8 million this quarter,
which was $1.4 million lower than the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis held up well,
falling 5 basis points this quarter to 3.18%, which was close to our expected range of NIM in the low to mid-3.20s.
The decrease this quarter included a 2 basis point decline in purchase accounting accretion. Non-interest income
of $28.4 million this quarter was down $4.1 million from the prior quarter. Excluding security losses, core non-
interest income was down $4.4 million to $28.5 million, falling short of our expectation of $30 million to $31 million.
The primary driver of the miss was capital markets fees, which were $2.2 million lower than last quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2023
Shifting to expenses, non-interest expenses totaled $111 million this quarter. That's up $1.6 million from last
quarter. However, excluding restructuring, tax credit costs, and asset gains and losses, the run rate of recurring
operating expenses decreased $3.4 million to $107.4 million coming in better than our forecast of $109 million to
$110 million. The decrease was driven by $1.4 million lower advertising costs and $1.6 million decrease in
professional fees.
As we close out 2023 next quarter, HTLF expects loan growth of $150 million to $200 million to be primarily
funded by customer deposit growth of $125 million to $175 million. In addition, we expect an additional $100
million of seasonal draws on ag lines of credit that we anticipate will be repaid in the first quarter of 2024.
Achieving these loan and deposit growth expectations enables the bulk of investment cash flows to be utilized to
decrease wholesale deposits and short-term borrowings.
Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis is expected to stabilize in the 3.20% range, excluding any Fed
moves prior to year-end. Provision for credit losses is projected to remain in the $3 million to $5 million range.
This assumes relatively stable credit performance and a manageable level of economic contraction over the next
12 months.
Core non-interest income, excluding investment gains or losses, is expected to be flat at $28 million to $29
million. We expect a reduction in consumer NSF and OD fees as we institute new policies across our now single
charter customer base, and we see a continued decline in mortgage-related revenue. Both of these will be offset
by higher capital markets fees. Recurring operating expenses are expected to be $109 million to $110 million.
This excludes any new FDIC assessments that may be levied next quarter.
Charter consolidation, restructuring costs are forecast to be $2 million to $3 million next quarter, which includes
both the final consolidation implementation expenses, as well as expenses to complete several span of control
improvements next quarter as we achieve the remaining benefits of the charter consolidation project.
We also expect to have some additional restructuring costs and real estate write-downs that will be booked over
the next couple of quarters as we begin to execute the next phase of facilities optimization and other HTLF 3.0
initiatives. We will have more details to share next quarter regarding our views of the 2024 performance, including
the impact of these new HTLF 3.0 initiatives. And finally, we believe a tax rate of 23%, excluding tax credits, is a
reasonable run rate.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Liesch of
Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good afternoon. Just on the margin guide of around 3.20%, that's up
from 3.18%. So, do you think you could even rise beyond that, irrespective of what the Fed does?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'm always cautious to go too far on the margin, but the reason we think it's going to go up from where we were is,
last quarter, right at the end is when we saw the pay-down of the wholesale, borrowings and funding and
deposits. So that's a carryover and come down a little bit this quarter as we hopefully get the deposit growth that
we're looking for. And we also saw a slowing in the mix shift that was going from noninterest-bearing to interest-
bearing account. So as those two things waned at the end of the third quarter and go into the fourth quarter, we
think we can see the margin go up a tick or two. Beyond that, there's so many variables in there. Andrew, I hate to
go too far and get ahead of ourselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. So, I mean, at this point, do you think another 25 basis points would matter that much?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Not at the current betas that are out there on the deposit side. If we got back to normal betas, which for us are
about a 30% beta – this quarter, for example, our betas were over 100% because of the catch-up and everything.
So if we get back to normal betas, there would be a little bit from a Fed move but not a lot at this point. We're kind
of topping out on the benefit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it, got it. And then, just on your commentary on the tax rate, like 23% this quarter closer to 22%. So was there
a 1% benefit to the tax rate from that tax credit amortization that you mentioned earlier and operating expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. For this quarter, yeah. For this last past quarter, yeah.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte of KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good evening, guys. I hope everybody's doing well today. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the credit front.
It's nice to see NPLs not really move at all, sorry, NPAs not really move at all. And it looks like within there, you
had NPLs coming down and a little bit of a tick-up here in OREO. Is that just a loan that moved into OREO status
or were there some other moving parts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Correct, Damon. This is Nathan Jones. That's a credit we had in our non-pass. It's a multifamily credit. We felt
after looking at it, there were some disagreement between sponsors. It was the best to move quickly on this one
and just drive a fast conclusion for the best overall resolution. So that's what we did. But we don't think it's
systemic or any other issues that go with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay, that's good. And then with regards to the outlook for loan growth, you guys seem to be continuing to
fire on all cylinders here. What areas of your footprint are you seeing like the best opportunities? Has that
changed at all in the last couple of quarters or it's still kind of the Western side of the footprint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Damon, this is Bruce. It's still really the Mountain West to the West to the Southwest. It's a little lighter in the
Midwest right now. But I would call it steady. It's all of the calling efforts that we've been putting in, actually, for
probably in the last 24 months are really starting to pay dividends. And because we are open for business, we've
been recruiting, we've been calling on new customers, and that's really helped when some of the banks in some
of the markets that we operate in, they've been sputtering a little bit, trying to decide whether they're going to be in
business or not.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's all that I have for now. I'll step back. Thank you.

Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.

Bruce K. Lee A

Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. So with the charter consolidation complete, can you just remind me of the $20 million of savings, how much of
that do you think falls to the bottom line, let's say, in 2024 versus how much of that will be reinvested into growth?
And really how could that or how does that play into the HTLF 3.0 in terms of accelerating or organic growth
across the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think we'll double team this one. I'll take the first part in terms of what has fallen to the bottom line, we have a
slide in our deck. I think it's – let me just find that real quick. I think it's slide 10, where we show what our core
operating expenses to assets has done over time. And so we started this back in 2021. We were running at about
2.22% of cost to assets. We're now down, this quarter, down to 2.08%.
If you do the math on about $20 billion – we've been about $20 billion that whole time, give or take – that's about
$28 million of run rate reduction in our expenses. So the $20 million's in there. We do have a little bit so it's more
than that. There's some other things in there. But I think we've gotten a $20 million plus I think we'll get just a little
bit more here as we do the span of control changes here in the fourth quarter. So that's what we've got steaming
into next year. However, I'll let Bruce talk about what we're planning to reinvest and a little bit more about HTLF
3.0.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes. So, Terry, you'll hear us talk at the end of the year in the next quarter kind of more about HTLF 3.0. But I
guess the way I think about it, everything that Bryan just described is really going to fall to the bottom line. We're
going to be reinvesting the span of control, as well as looking at management layers, looking at our branch
footprint, looking at the size of our branch locations. That's where we're really going to get the investment dollars
for next year in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And, Bryan, appreciate all the forward-looking commentary for the fourth quarter. Specifically, the
service charges, which were $18.6 million in the third quarter. How much of a decline do you expect because of
9

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2023
the new policies that you mentioned? And I guess what gives you confidence that the capital markets line will
return?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, a couple of things there. So I think it's around $600,000. We'll be implementing this in December.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
But the NSF reduction for Q4 is about $600,000. And then, as I said, mortgage banking for us has been coming
down. I think it's going to continue to kind of fall off, just not seeing a lot of good activity there. The capital markets
piece, I think third quarter was just soft for us. I think there's some things that we now see coming into the fourth
quarter. And I think Bruce may have a couple of comments here, but I feel pretty confident we can make that up
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes. So, Terry, one of the things on the capital markets front, we've taken a really hard look at our pipeline, and
we've really spent the last probably two weeks, maybe even three weeks out there talking to a lot of our
customers who currently have floating rate debt, sort of adding value, showing them the inverted yield curve and
looking at a three year or [ph] four year (00:31:54) out. They can actually reduce – by doing a swap, they can
reduce their interests cost. So we've seen our pipelines really begin to grow as we've been out there talking to
customers and helping them look at how to create some fixed rate debt from floating on their own balance sheet,
which help them manage their own interest rate risk.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Thank you, guys. Do you have handy the balance of shared national credits that you have on balance
sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. First of all, shared national credits for us, it's not really a focus. Our strategy is really [indiscernible]
(00:33:00). It's really gaining that exposure with some of the companies in the markets we really want kind of a
deeper relationship with and exposure in those markets. But overall, if you take all participations that we have that
we purchased them, where we're not the lead bank, it's only about 9% of our book. It's mostly C&I and really
we've maintained discipline. We maintained the rest of our portfolio. They are very disciplined, both geographic
diversification as well as industry diversification. I think our largest concentration [ph] then have been (00:33:33)
manufacturing. So we feel good about that book and where we're at. Bruce, anything you'd like to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Andrew, we've really viewed this as not an asset play here, but it's a relationship play in all of our
transactions. Whether we're a buyer or a seller, we have a noncredit relationships. And I think, and correct me if
I'm wrong, Nathan, but I think that we have purchased about 9%, but we've also sold about 4.5% or 5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's about 5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So it's about a net of the total book is a net of about 4% or 5% of our total portfolio.

Got it. Very helpful. Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question. Comes from the line of Jeff Rulis of D.A. Davidson.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a question on the, as you've wind down the charter consolidation, more
specific to maybe the folks that were really assigned to that process, I just wanted to see if there's a rotation or
there's a reassignment of those and maybe that comes as part of HTLF 3.0 or just want to get the sense for if
there was a head count that was sort of assigned to oversee that and did they pivot? And are there any expected
positive impact as they kind of relook at other projects?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2023
Yeah. So if you think about – I guess I'll answer it this way. We have very few 100% dedicated folks to the project
that were on our payroll. And so within those restructuring charges were very little salaries for folks. So [ph] our
internal (00:35:40) people will get reassigned to the projects and other things that we're looking at for HTLF 3.0.
And again, they were doing their day job as well as doing the consolidation.
We thought we might have to do more. But the consolidations, quite frankly, went very smooth and
congratulations to all the folks at HTLF because I think they did a great job of getting the projects done and doing
their day jobs and all the other things that we needed to do. So it was very good. Most of that cost that we used
people for was external consultants that came in and helped us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just to circle back, maybe for Nathan on the nonperforming loans, some
reductions there, but looked like there was even a balance that kind of came in that's new on that down. But just
in general credit comments, does it sound like you're too concerned about systemic changes? But maybe if you
could touch on what was added and areas that kind of you're looking at that are softening at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Our nonperforming was down about $11.6 million, but there was a slight increase. That's really an ag
credit, and the majority of that is actually USDA guaranteed. So we don't have large concerns there about the
increase. We continue to monitor it. We're watching the economy as well. We follow up with different economists
across, trying to understand and talk to my peers where we're seeing weak spots. We just don't see anything at
this point that's systemic to be concerned about, but we continue to monitor it very diligently though.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And I think, Jeff, if you're referring to the table that we have in the back, where we show the ins and outs of
nonperformers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So $11 million item that ended up in OREO, that went through. So it grossed up the in and the out of
nonperformers. It was in performing loans at the end of last quarter, became a problem. We jumped on it right
away. So in our tables, we kind of flowed that as a plus and a minus through NPLs to get to OREO.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2023
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
...in the new maybe it kind of shows new nonperformers, but it was like a temporary new because it came in then
went out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We took the new and the reduction both down by $11 million. Then I think you'd see what really was the net other
ins and outs of the nonperformance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A

[ph] The non-nonperformance (00:38:11).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Okay, thanks and, Bruce, it sounds like we'll kind of give you some time on the HTLF 3.0, but you did touch
on geographies and kind of taken a look at. What would be the metrics or the demographics, and not to
oversimplify it, but where do you – I mean, I think the answer is efficiency. But anything that you'd lead us into
before we get that reveal of kind of geographies that makes sense, some that don't in that discussion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So we'll get in a lot more detail the next time we all talk. But, look, when you look at our footprint, it's clear
that we don't have scale in a fair amount of our markets. And our long-term goal is both efficiency and growth
potential for us. And so we are looking very heavily, not only at the branch network, but the actual geography to
make decisions on whether we should expand or we should contract in those geographies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. We'll look forward to the update. Thank you.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2023
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
But I would say the keys for us, it's all about EPS, it's all about expense control and what does it do to our TCE. I
mean, those are sort of the three things that are always in the forefront of our minds as we're making decisions
about geographies, the branch play that we've been talking about, as well as span of control and layers of
management. Now that we have the charter consolidation done, we can actually execute some of these things.
But we have to get the consolidations done so that we could then move to the next phase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Lee for closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Latif. In closing, HTLF had a solid third quarter. We continue to add relationships, grow customer
deposits, grow quality loans, maintain stable credit quality, and drive efficiency. While we remain focused on
continuing to achieve organic growth, we're also focused on reducing expenses, increasing EPS, and growing
TCE over the next few quarters. We continue to evaluate our balance sheet and capital structure to maximize
efficiency and flexibility, and we're analyzing our expense structure, including geographies, branch footprint,
management layers, and span of control. We'll provide more guidance in the fourth quarter.
Thank you for joining us tonight. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late January. Have a good evening,
everyone.

Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
