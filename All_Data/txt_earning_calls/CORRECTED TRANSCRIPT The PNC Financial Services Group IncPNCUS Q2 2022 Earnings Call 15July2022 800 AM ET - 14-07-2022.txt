Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, highlighted by
9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage, resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained
strong credit quality and fees rebounded from the first quarter, driven primarily by capital markets activity,
including Harris Williams, and continued growth in card and cash management. The strong loan growth and rising
rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully.
Loan growth was driven by C&I, where new production increased significantly and utilization returned to near pre-
pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew, driven by mortgage and home equity. Higher rates continued to
adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response, we continued to reposition the portfolio
during the quarter, resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held in held to maturity. We returned $1.4
billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.
Looking forward, there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating in, including the impact of higher rates,
supply chain disruptions and inflation. But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a
strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management and
differentiated strategies for organic growth, will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus
is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control.
Along those lines, we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter, including the build-out of our new
BBVA and expansion markets, modernizing our retail banking technology platform, bolstering our asset
management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial
customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences, our performance in the BBVA
markets has exceeded our own expectations.
On slide 3, you can see the strong growth we've generated in these markets across customer segments. In
corporate banking, we've seen sales increase 40% linked quarter and maintained a 50% non-credit mix of sales

since conversion. We've seen similar growth within commercial banking, where sales in the BBVA USA markets
are up 32% linked quarter and non-credit sales to total sales have been approximately 55% since conversion.
In retail banking, we've experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of 16%
and 22% respectively. And we continue to invest in AMG and a big part of that is building a strong customer-
focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint. We have built good momentum in our recruiting
efforts over the past few quarters, hiring advisers across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients.
I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving
forward, we believe that we're well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results and then we'll take your questions.

Well, thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average
basis. During the quarter, loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5%. Investment
securities grew approximately $1 billion or 1% and our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined
$23 billion.
Deposit balances averaged $447 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per
common share as of June 30, a 7% decline linked quarter, entirely AOCI-driven as a function of higher rates. And
as of June 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be
well positioned with significant capital flexibility.
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends
and $737 million of share repurchases or 4.3 million shares. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of
our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know, our Stress
Capital Buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022 is now 2.9% and our applicable ratios are
comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums.
Earlier this year, our Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase framework, which allows for up to 100
million common shares, of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30. This allows
for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars, as well as the flexibility to increase
those levels should conditions warrant.
Slide five shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our
expanded franchise, particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates. 2021, as you know, was characterized by
low utilization levels, PPP loan forgiveness, and in PNC's case, a repositioning of certain acquisition-related
portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter,
reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans.
Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $13 billion, driven by higher new production as well as utilization.
Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to high-quality, short-term loans that are expected to
mature during the second half of the year. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased more than
120 basis points and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter.

PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans
increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans and
loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter, driven by higher interest rates.
Slide six highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio, as well as the average balance changes linked
quarter. We have a strong core deposit base, which is two-thirds interest-bearing and one-third noninterest-
bearing. Within interest-bearing, 70% are consumer, and within noninterest-bearing, 50% are commercial
compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter, our loan-to-
deposit ratio was 71%, which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average.
On the right, you can see linked-quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the
second quarter, a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4%,
primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality.
Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%.
Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased eight basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points.
Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle, but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third
quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast. And as a result, we now
expect our betas to approach 30% by year end compared to our previous expectation of 22%.
Slide 7 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the
quarter, representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The
yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well
as lower premium amortization.
On a spot basis, our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely
offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned, in total, we now have 60% of our securities in
held to maturity as of June 30, which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates.
Net pre-tax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This
includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity, which will accrete back over the remaining
lives of those securities.
Turning to the income statement on slide 8, as you can see, second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5
billion or $3.39 per share, which included pre-tax integration costs of $14 million. Excluding integration costs,
adjusted EPS was $3.42.
Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2%,
resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million and our effective tax rate was
18.5%.
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total
revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter.
Net interest income of $3.1 billion was up $247 million or 9%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning
assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs and, as a result, net interest
margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $211
million or 13% linked quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Looking at the detail of each category, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3%,
reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital market-related fees rebounded as expected and increased $157
million or 62%, driven by higher M&A [ph] advisory receipts. (11:13)
Card and cash management revenue grew $51 million or 8%, driven by higher consumer spending activity and
increased treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services increased $13 million or 5%,
reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integration-related fee waivers. Residential and
commercial mortgage non-interest income was essentially stable linked quarter, but higher revenue from
commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue.
Finally, other noninterest income declined $34 million and included a $16 million Visa negative fair value
adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes.
Turning to slide 10. Our second quarter expenses were up by $72 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by
increased business activity, merit increases and higher marketing spend. These increases were partially offset by
seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense.
We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to
reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program and we're confident we'll
achieve our full-year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and
technology investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 11. Overall, we saw broad improvements across all categories.
Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31, and continue to
represent less than 1% of total loans.
Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30, a $188 million decline linked quarter, reflecting lower consumer
and commercial loan delinquencies, which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and
operational delays.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million, a decrease of $54 million linked quarter, driven by lower
consumer net charge-offs, primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans
continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter, our allowance for credit losses
remained essentially stable and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans.
In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter and we're well positioned for the second half of 2022 as we
continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we
expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of 2022, resulting in 2% average annual real GDP
growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder
of this year to a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year end.
Looking at the third quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances
to be up 1% to 2%. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be
down 3% to 5%, which results in total revenue increasing 4% to 6%. We expect total noninterest expense to be
stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022, third quarter expectations, and current
economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of
approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%.
Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However, relative to
our expectations at that time, we now expect more net interest income from higher rates, offset by somewhat
lower fees. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our
effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Rob, can you elaborate a little further on the deposit beta change? Is it purely just the rate of change in interest
rates going up so fast, or is there a deposit mix that's also influencing your new outlook for the beta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Gerard. Yeah, probably both, but a little bit more the former. We're just at that point
now where we're seeing rates rising to the point where the betas are becoming active. They were not that active
on the consumer side, a little bit on the commercial side in the first quarter and that's picked up a bit, more on the
commercial side as we expected and, in our case, it's our non-operating deposits, that explains the decline there
in the second quarter. So betas are beginning to move. We expected that and we're ready for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Credit quality, obviously, was quite strong for you folks, similar to the prior quarter. And Bill, I don't
know – I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there with what's going on in the world, but it just seems that for your
7

company at least, you are so well positioned from a credit quality standpoint. And is it – are we just going to go off
a cliff or something at the end of the year with some sort of big recession that has frightened everybody about
credit quality for banks in general and any elaboration on your outlook on credit and the outlook for the economy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I don't think there's any cliff involved. I do think that the trouble ahead lies somewhere in the middle
of next year, not any time in the next six months. But what you're seeing inside of our credit book, you got to
remember that during this period of time, we continue to kind of run off a higher risk book from BBVA and our loan
growth is largely in higher quality names. So the overall quality of our book actually improves quarter on quarter.
Eventually, that has to stop. And eventually, I think the Fed has to slow the economy to a pace to get inflation
under control and I think that's going to be harder to do than the market currently assumes and I think it's going to
take longer than the market currently assumes.
And when that happens, we're going to see credit costs go up, at least back to what we would call normalized
levels. But I don't think – I don't see any particular bubbles inside of the banking system as it relates to credit. I
think you're just going to see a slow grind with credit losses increasing over time as we get into the slowdown.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. There was a time where you talked about increasing the mix of your
securities given all the liquidity in the system. But as the Fed engages in QT and with the strong loan growth that
you're seeing, could we see you go the other way and perhaps redeploy some of your securities portfolio

paydowns to fund more of your growth such that you actually remix more – a larger mix of your earning assets
towards loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think over time, that is probably likely if we continue to see loan growth the way we do. But you shouldn't mix
security balances with the way we think about fixed rate exposure hedging our deposits, right? Securities are one
way we do that, swaps are another way and then, of course, our fixed rate assets themselves and then inside of
that, the duration of the securities we buy.
So long story short, the balances probably decline, but we're sitting in a period of time right now where we're very
asset-sensitive. You'll notice our balances basically stayed flat through the course of the quarter as we kind of
purposely watch and let things roll off here given our view on what we think longer term rates are going to
ultimately do. So balances could go down, just as a matter of sort of algebra in the balance sheet, but our ability
to invest in rising rates is still there in a large way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, that's right. Look, the context – Bill, as you know, the context of your question is historically pre sort of the
rapid increase in liquidity over the last couple of years, we did run about 20% of our securities to our earning
assets. We raised that because of all the liquidity in the system. So we're still pretty high on a historical basis. But
as Bill Demchak just said, that's not likely to change anytime soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. And separately, as the Fed proceeds through the hiking cycle, at some point, I
think as you've both alluded to in your comments, that's going to presumably slow the pace of growth. But you're
taking your loan growth guidance higher for the year. Maybe could you speak to how much of that improved
outlook is idiosyncratic because it certainly does sound like you're expecting a deceleration at some point at the
macro level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
A lot of it just comes from our ability to win new business. Utilization rates have largely approached where we
were, I think, Rob, pre-pandemic at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So there's a little bit of room there. But these new markets and our – just our ability to win new business and by
the way, new business that is 50% fee-based is pretty strong. And we feel confident we'll be able to continue to do
that independent of what happens in the economy.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. And I would just add to that. In terms of the loan growth outlook for the 12 months, we're up a bit mostly
because of the outperformance in the first half relative to our expectations. So that's sort of truing up, so to speak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And if I could squeeze in one last one. I think it's interesting, Bill, to think about your commentary around
the normalization of credit as the Fed proceeds through its hiking cycle. And sort of we think about the long and
variable lags that between monetary policy and when that ultimately starts to show up in credit and then you sort
of juxtapose that with what's happening with reserve rates, which it's notable that for most of your peers, they've
drifted below their day one levels. And I know, for you guys, there's a BBVA deal and lots of other moving parts,
but that 1.65% seems relatively conservative. How are you thinking about the trajectory of that from here in the
context of the thought process you just laid out of the Fed hiking cycle eventually leading to credit normalization
probably as we get into maybe the middle of next year or somewhere in that timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's an impossible question to answer given the dynamics of CECL. But you should assume – we assume that
all else equal, credit quality is going to deteriorate at some pace from here through the next two years. I just don't
think it's going to be all that dramatic and it almost has to be a true statement given the charge-off levels that
we've been seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. And I would add to that, our reserve levels are above our day one CECL even adjusted for the BBVA
acquisition, we're appropriately reserved and feel good about it.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey, guys. Just wanted to just ask – to dissect a little bit. Rob, you mentioned that your outlook for NII is a little bit
better. Your outlook for fees a little softer. The NII one, I think we get, just wondering if you can help us
understand now what kind of curve you're building in and is it more just that uptick of rates that offsets that new
30% beta outcome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. That's right. Good morning, Ken. Yeah, that's exactly right. So higher rate environment, NII and the
balances that we've generated contribute to the improved NII look. And then you sort of referenced it in terms of
10

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
the fees, mostly in terms of our full-year expectations compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year
and last quarter, some softer on AMG and mortgage, as you would expect, with the equity markets performing like
they are for AMG and interest rates on the mortgage side. So it's sort of the trade-off of the higher rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it right. Sorry, I missed your 3.25%, 3.50% comment from earlier. So thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
And then just on the fee side then, you had a really good bounce back as you expected, especially in that capital
market. So what's your – what's changed there in terms of what you're seeing as far as the outlook on the fee
side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, on the fee side, again, for the full year, most of the change relative to our full year expectations is within AMG
and mortgage. On capital markets, you'll recall, we had a soft first quarter relative to our expectations. We did see
the bounce back in the second quarter. So we're back in position with our full year expectations in the second
half, obviously remains to be seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned – Bill, you mentioned all the different ways that you
can get exposure to variable rates and such. I'm just wondering how are you guys thinking about just swaps
portfolio, you had done some adds in terms of protecting and managing the near-term upside versus the potential
of what happens down the road based on Fed funds futures curve expectations and your general view of the
economy? Thanks guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We don't think about the swaps book separate from our basic investing and fixed rate exposure. Where we sit
across the securities book and swaps and everything we do fixed rate, we're looking at a curve now where I kind
of think the year-end rates, in my own mind, are probably largely right. But I think there's a – I think the
assumption that the Fed is going to start easing in the spring of next year is absurd, which means we're holding
off at this point because we think there's going to be – there's still value to be had in the longer end of the curve
as people come to the realization that inflation isn't as easy to tame as people might assume. And separately that
the Fed isn't going to immediately cut simply because the economy slows if inflation is still running high. So we're
going to sit pat, but it's not – we don't think swaps are one thing in bonds or another. We just – we look at our
interest rate exposure. We're very asset-sensitive. We have an opportunity to deploy in multiple places. We're just
not doing it. We've basically let everything run down thus far this year.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. I'm sure this is the question that Ken asked, but I just wanted to clarify, the loan growth
expectation rose, the performance has been spectacular, the revenues didn't move even though we had the
higher loan growth and the higher rate outlook and that's because of the higher beta assumed and also lower
fees, Rob?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, in part. I think the earlier question you might have missed it, Erika, was the improved outlook for the full-year
loan growth. The answer was most of that was a true-up to our outperformance in the first half. So, we grew loans
faster than we thought we would in the first six months, which is great. So we true-up that full-year expectation.
So, all of that is built into the full-year guidance.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Part of the impact that we're seeing in NII and NIM is actually on our loan yields, where the quality of our book as
it improves fairly substantially, we've put a lot of very high-grade stuff on. And spreads have actually come in
quarter on quarter. So when we look at the out forecast on NII, together with loan growth, which will be pretty
healthy, we have in there – embedded in there this notion that spreads are tighter than [ph] we – they were is
(00:29:48) we basically improve the quality of the book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Erika Najarian Q

Got it. And just as a follow-up question, how should we think about deposit growth from here? Bill, I think you've
been the one that has been vocal about the notion that if loan growth is positive, deposit growth should be
positive. How should we weigh that relative to probably your willful desire to work out the non-operating deposits
out of your balance sheet and QT?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Yeah. Well, it's a good question and the answer remains to be seen a little bit. We've clearly seen the larger
corporates move liquidity out of the banking system into money markets – government money markets. And I
think, as we go forward, the combination of QT from the Fed and what they do with their repo facility is going to
drive some of the yields available in those funds, which in turn is going to drive how much of that sits on banks'
balance sheets or not.
Outside of those deposits, it's more about a rate paid game. And I think deposits kind of inside of the retail space
and the smaller mid-market commercial space, I think deposits actually grow simply because of the loan volume.
But the mix shift that we've seen in commercial from a little bit less noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that
game's going to play out.
So thus far, I mean, if you look at total liquidity in the system, it really hasn't moved. And of course, the Fed hasn't
really started their QT program yet. What we've seen is a movement of liquidity from banks into money funds as
money fund yields started to grow. So this is going to take a while to play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. And our expectations, Erika, are generally stable, but that Bill pointed, the mix could be different and an
open question on the non-operational deposits, which we'll either do or not do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. A big part of what we've seen go thus far are kind of deposits that we don't really care about. They were –
we kind of call them surge deposits internally, which were non-core clients parking liquidity that now have kind of
gone into funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my last question, Bill, you said earlier you don't really see any bubbles within the banking system. I
think a lot of investors are more concerned about what's outside of the banking system. And interestingly, I'm sure
you know this statistic very well. Corporate lending in terms of the bank share of it has declined to 16%.
I guess my question to you is, do you see an opportunity as rates rise and the economy slows down, is some of
that market share available back to banks in terms of what's happened in the private market, or was that never
credit that you wanted to do anyway? And don't you have a unit within PNC that does third-party recoveries in
terms of if you have corporate defaults, you could be a third-party recoverer if that's the term?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Well, first, I want to see the audit on only 16% of corporate credit being inside of banks, but I'm sure there's
some way you can [indiscernible] (00:33:21)

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No, we – as credit outside of the banking system melts, we play in that in two ways. One is, if it's in the real estate
space, we do that inside of our special servicing arm in Midland. Two is, we are very good at working corporate
credits and we wouldn't be afraid of buying portfolios of troubled assets.
And three, and I think this is what you're referring to, is in our asset-based lending group, we play the role of
senior lender on a very secured basis for – and basically the agent for the entire capital structure. And as pieces
below us struggle, the fee opportunity for us to work those loans out on behalf of the B lenders is quite high.
Furthermore, we continue to be approached by multiple B lenders to basically run their books as they look at
what's coming their way. Thus far, we haven't agreed to do any of that. And were we to do it, I think it'd be quite
lucrative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. I guess, all these questions get down to NIM. So are you forecasting deposits to run off for the year
because you've mentioned betas are starting to move – and I missed the updated guidance – because you're
guiding for good NII growth. So how much deposit runoff are you assuming in your deposit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I can jump on that and we covered some of that, Mike. Generally speaking, and we recognize the fluidity, for the
second half, we're calling for stable deposits, some mix change between non-interest-bearing and interest-
bearing, also an open question in terms of non-operational deposits and what betas are required for that and
whether we choose to keep those or not. So, that all remains to be seen, but the outlook is stable. And NIM, we
do expect to expand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And you talked about tighter loan yield spreads just because you're going up in quality. Are you getting rewarded
for this more uncertain outlook? I mean, capital markets, some assets are pricing at near recession levels, but I
feel like the lending markets are not doing the same. And are you getting more spread for the added chance of a
recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It depends on the lending sector. So we are, for example, an asset-based – straight spreads on high-rated stuff
has kind of stabilized. A lot of what we're seeing is just a mix shift in the quality of our book, not a change in the
market in terms of spread.
Where I think the market continues to be irrational is on the consumer side. So auto lending seems, in our view, to
be a little bit of a bubble, and some of the things we're still seeing being done on the consumer side. But on the
corporate side, on the real estate side, the shift is moving back towards the banks in terms of our ability to
negotiate and get spread and get covenants and get structure. Just not a dramatic shift the way you've seen in
some of the headline stuff on capital markets-related issues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, you're getting some of that. Bill, can you put this in context? This looks like the fastest commercial loan growth
in 14 years and we haven't had a cycle like this in quite some time. And I guess I'm repeating I think what you've
said in the past. It's inventory, it's credit utilization, it's capital expenditures, it's working capital, some business
from capital markets back to the banks. Did I miss anything there?

No. I mean it's – thank you for reminding. I mean that's what happened, right? We've had inventory build and
CapEx and a little volume back to the banks and boom, you get big loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
The one I didn't mention that some other banks have mentioned, you did not. So I don't want to lead the witness
here, but in terms of gaining share from nonbanks, because you're seeing some nonbank entities not on a solid
footing as they were in the past. Are you gaining share from them? Do you expect to gain share from them? Are
there opportunities to do so? Are you shifting resources? Because I get it, you're the national Main Street Bank,
you're in 30 MSAs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
You have a lot on your plate to try and gain share in all those markets. Meanwhile, you have some verticals where
you might be able to gain share. What are you doing to try to capitalize on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Mike, most of those players play in a risk bucket that we don't like to play in, right? So the exception to that
is in our asset-based lending book, where borrowers who might have been able to do a cash flow loan with a BDC
at one point are now going to come back to the banks and do it asset-based. But on the consumer side, the guys
who are out there playing subprime consumer or even in the leverage lending side, cash flow unsecured, we just
don't have a big book of business there, nor do we want one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And my last one, just on CECL. You didn't – I mean you beat on credit. Your credit is great. You've always
been high quality. You proved it through the global financial crisis. We get it. But with all this talk about a
recession out there, doesn't that give you cover to go ahead and increase reserves? I get it you're above day one

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Back to the commercial loan growth topic, and sorry if I missed the detail on it, but I know you mentioned the $5
billion in high-quality, short-term loans that were brought on that you expect to mature in the second half. Can you
give a little bit of color on that – on those balances and what drove it? And maybe a little bit in terms of outlook,
could you see additional flows in that type of lending as well? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We'd like to see additional flows in that type of lending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's kind of – that was client – a handful of clients, but client-specific timing issues that we were able to serve client
needs and they're big balances and they're going to run off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

And we'd like to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. That happens again, that's great. But these were specific ones we called out both because of their size and
also because they're lower spreads than the rest of the book and that had some impact on the loan yield this
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And then also related to that, in what areas do you expect that you could see some moderation in
commercial loan demand as we do get some slowing in economic activity if the Fed succeeds here with the
tightening?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Eventually, what you're going to see, we've seen utilizations go up as people have built inventories. Now, that will
reverse itself as we get into a slowdown and people struggle to move inventories, it will peak and then they'll grind
it to a halt. But I think that's going to end up being the driver.
We'll continue to go work and gain share. And ultimately, against the money we put out, we look at what happens
to utilizations and utilizations will start to drop through a slowdown, peak early into it and then slow down as they
try to free up working capital.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, got it. Thanks, Bill. And then back to the loan loss reserve front. I hear you again in terms of the adequacy
of your reserve. In your scenarios, did your economic scenarios that you run that support CECL, did they get
worse at all versus last quarter? Or did they – like how did that change? And then separately, did you have any
reallocations within the reserve that were noteworthy, like coming from commercial going into consumer? If you
can maybe talk about that. So just trying to get a better feel of your confidence...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

reserves as a function of the scenarios we run.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's pretty stable, John. So no big mix changes, no big dollar changes. The percentage came down

Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just one follow up, Rob. In terms of as we think about the outlook for deposit betas and margins, if the Fed
stops at the end of the year, you talked about the deposit beta and deposit growth expectations in the back half.
But give us a sense of the asset sensitivity profile of the balance sheet in a world where the Fed stops hiking, the
2-10 remains inverted for 6 to 12 months. And as Bill alluded to, we may not get cuts as quickly. In that backdrop,
do you still expect the margin to drift higher? Or do we start seeing some liability sensitivity where deposits are
repricing higher, but you're not seeing the benefit on the asset side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, yes. We don't give explicit NIM outlook. But I would say your question is when does NIM peak? We see
NIMs continuing to expand and peaking in 2023. So with everything that you described, we still see upside in
NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. So safe to assume that even in a backdrop where the Fed stops hiking, the NIM should still at least drift
higher a bit for a few more quarters. So point noted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, possibly. And again, we're in sort of that context, we're talking about 2023 then, 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

2023, yes. And I didn't mean to pin you down or ask for 2023 guidance. I'm just trying to conceptually think if we
go into this period where we've not been, where the curve remains flat to inverted for a while, what that does to
the NIM and it's not unique to you, but appreciate the color.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, you have to – the number of pieces that are moving inside of that, even if – let's assume they get out there
and they just freeze and you have a small inversion in the curve and you sit there, in that instance, betas probably
don't move from wherever they were post the last hike. And instead, what you're going to see is a increase in
fixed rate asset yields that basically roll off from very low yields into higher yields and then the upside, to the
extent we want to deploy at that point. So you see a gain in yields inside of the security book in a static
environment simply because everything that was purchased with 1.5% handles rolls off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. That's right. That's why we're still – some part – some ways from the peak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's fair. I appreciate the perspective. And on the lending side, just still wanted to follow up on two things. One,
like do you have a sense of where customers are in terms of rebuilding inventories like that's been a big driver of
growth for the last two to three quarters? But compared to pre-pandemic, are customer inventories back to those
levels? Like how would you frame that? And secondly, would love to hear your thoughts about just outlook for the
commercial real estate market in this backdrop, especially if we get a recession? You've been cautious in the
past, so would love to hear your thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The inventory question is all over the place because you have a bunch of customers who have more
inventory than they want. And you have others who are still struggling to build inventory to keep up with supply
because of continued supply chain disruption. So I don't know that there's a simple answer on inventories.
Real estate, with the exception of the slow burn on office, where we just – we continue to be worried, we continue
to see slow deterioration, we think we're really well reserved. But absent that kind of slow burn, the rest of it
continues to kind of do okay to improve. And I think that holds even at least on the slowdown that's in the back of
my mind. Again, I just don't see some big spike into a really ugly recession. So we have our eye on real estate.
We have exposure into the office space that we're reserved against. It's kind of doing what we expected. And
beyond that, we're not particularly worried about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And to your point, we're well reserved. And multifamily, which is the biggest component of that, is very
strong.

Good morning. As we think about loan loss reserves in, call it, a moderate recession, how high or how much add
do you think you have to do? I think for COVID, it was around $2.5 billion ex the day one CECL impact. But
obviously, there's been a mix shift, the BBVA deal and a lot of factors. But as you guys run your stress tests, what
would cumulative reserve bill be for a moderate recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No way to answer that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, I was going to say – Bill said there was an earlier impossible question. Yes, that one might be number two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But, Matt, I mean, remember that reserve build in COVID, right, the scenarios we were running – I don't
remember off the top of my head, [ph] it was unemployment (00:49:49) to 15%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Or higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...GDP. We're not – this has nothing to do with that, right? We're going to go into a slowdown and we're going to
see an increase in reserves at some point, but they're not even going to be related to the thing we saw when
COVID hit...

set and remove it from the framework of how you think about provisions going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Right. So it seems like you're implying, and we've heard it from some others, that it should be a lot less. But I
guess we'll see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

15% to 20%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
15%. Yeah. I mean it was – I don't think there's anybody out there who thinks we have to crater the economy by
that amount to get inflation under control. That was – look, there could be some world event that causes that, but
it's not going to be a function of the Fed raising rates and slowing the economy to get inflation under control.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, agreed. I mean obviously, that's what the market's still worried about. And it's just interesting, if you put it
relative to capital, even if you did what you did for COVID, it's only 50 basis points of capital. So that's helpful.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Look, you're bringing up – this whole issue is the issue, I think, that investors just have completely wrong about
the banking system right now. If you look at the market cap that's been pulled out of the banking system and take
your worst case reserve build and charge-offs through some cycle, it's just wildly wrong. Yes, we'll have increased
losses, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Not to that extent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Not to anything close like what we've put in during COVID. And more importantly, I think there's a growth
opportunity through a mild downturn for us just given the way we run our business and the business it will come
back into the banking systems and out of the capital markets. So I'm personally confused about all the concern
that sits out there on banking reserves and the coming recession and the impacts on the profitability of banks. It
will hurt a little bit, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, and to your point, if it's being extrapolated from COVID scenarios...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's just – again, that's a data point they need to remove.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just the flip side, you've got a little over $8 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, a lot of that comes back
over time, the part that's related to the bond book. Just give us a rule of thumb like how much of that accretes
back each year, if rates stay here on the kind of the medium, longer-term part of the curve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, the held-to-maturity accretes back independent of rates at this point and I don't know – you guys

Bryan K. Gill A
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, you could say that, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean the way we kind of think about it internally, given how much we moved, is we ought to have pulled a par
on the held-to-maturity book adding to our capital base at a pace that largely hedges us against further declines in
AOCI in the available-for-sale book, depending how much of a spike the rates are versus the rolled [ph] up.
(00:53:31) But we feel pretty good about the mix we have at this point and obviously, it's not impacting our capital
flexibility vis-à-vis the way we look at AOCI inside of regulatory capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yes. And I guess what I was asking is like if we just think over the next few years, right, like all that OCI eventually
gets reversed back as the bonds mature...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
You are saddled with $8 billion of losses like a lot of banks, having a drag. I'm just wondering what's a good rule
of thumb? Does that $8 billion come back, kind of maybe $1.5 billion, $2 billion a year or something like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, let's see. We've got a duration in [ph] the book of (00:54:08) 4.7 years or something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, the short answer is approximately $200 million a quarter, $1 billion a year. So that's the number you're
looking for. But that's the right neighborhood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sorry, that's out of the held to maturity.

Stanley. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks. Just one follow up on that, on the AFS book. I guess the underlying question is, is the duration
roughly the same as the HTM book? I get that rates will move that mark around, but let's say, rates never change,
is it the same duration as HTM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, roughly. Yes, roughly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then just separately, I know there's a lot of questions earlier about deposits, et cetera.
And I'm just wondering, your loan-to-deposit ratio, I think, today is around 70%, maybe 71%. And in 4Q 2019, it
was at 83%. So there's lots of room there in the LDR. I'm wondering how you think about it. Are you happy to go
back to 83% in the near term or is there a trajectory or a pace that you're comfortable with?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, if it's high quality, we'd love to go back to 83%. If it's in our risk box and coupled with client relationships
where we have really strong cross-sell, that would be a great outcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] Well, (00:55:57) and that also relates to the deposit pricing and what we choose to do.

Robert Q. Reilly A

loan environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So part of the question is just trying to get a sense as to the pace of LDR increase you kind of control with
the deposit pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, that's my point. That's the flexibility. So we can and we can view these deposits in terms of whether
we want to pay for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I don't think – I mean, look, our intention here is to keep deposits and grow deposits if we can without having
to be aggressive on rate. It's very simple. And inside of that, we'd like to grow loans. And if we manage to do the
two things there and grow loan to deposits to 83%, we'll be making a boatload of money given the fee mix we get
when we grow loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I wanted to follow up just because, Bill, you're just – you seem so adamant that the market cap that's been
taken out of your stock far exceeds credit loss hits that you have in a scenario. So a personal question. You've
owned a lot of stock for a long time. You have a lot of skin in the game. At what point would you put more skin in
the game and buy some shares? We haven't seen that I think by any bank CEO. And if you think this is such a
dislocation and you think it's so unlikely to have some kind of deep recession, global financial crisis, pandemic
sort of situation, have you thought about that? I mean, would you do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think about it all the time. I don't know when I go into details on my own financial situation, but I see a lot of value
there. It's interesting. We've had a bunch of senior execs actually enroll in our employee stock purchase plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Which maybe is a simple way for me to get a few shares here and there. But look, I think there's a lot of value. I
don't know that you're going to see me make a giant purchase because, as you said, I own a lot of stock and it's
most of my net worth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just an extra tone for the top, but I guess you said it on the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just one more time on that question. Again, you have this disconnect between pricing the capital markets with
some other areas and your own expectations. So what you were saying before is that the power or the control has
gone back to the banks from the borrower in terms of terms and structure, maybe not the same degree of pricing
though. And I'm just – it's that pricing element that – it's tough for you or anyone to really know how much you
should be pricing these loans if you think we might be going into a recession. So, how do you get to that level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, I mean pricing ultimately is market-driven. I would expect, for a given credit quality, we're going to see small
backup. Of course, pricing is also based on a grid. So as we go into a slower economy and people run another
turn of leverage given their performance, we'll see jumps in spreads that's built into the existing contract because
spreads are performance based in a lot of the loans that we do. So we'll get there.
More important to us, Mike, is the cross-sell that we ultimately get. At the end, loan pricing – as long as we get
good structure, pricing is important, but pricing along with the majority of the TM relationship and capital markets
business really ups the return that you get from that client relationship.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And there's a structure component. There's a lot of good companies out there that don't have structures that we
would lend into that they could change that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then I guess one more. Just in terms of your 30 MSAs or your newer markets, your BBVA markets, do you
have any metrics on what market share you have there versus your legacy franchise because that would size the
opportunity?
