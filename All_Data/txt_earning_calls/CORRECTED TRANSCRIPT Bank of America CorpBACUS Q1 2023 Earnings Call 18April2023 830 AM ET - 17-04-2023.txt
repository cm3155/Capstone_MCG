Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Katherine. Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review our first quarter results. I
trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They are available including the
earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on the Investor Relations section of the
bankofamerica.com website.
I'm going to turn the call over to CEO Brian Moynihan and Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to discuss the quarter.
But before I do, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP
financial measures during this call. Our forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations and assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause those actual
results to materially differ from those expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that
are available on our website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US
GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials and those are available on our website.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning and thanks to all of you for joining us. I'm starting on slide 2 of the materials. Your company
produced one of its highest core EPS earnings numbers in a challenged operating environment in the first quarter.
Simply put, we navigated that environment well. The preparedness and strength of Bank of America and the trust
of our clients reflects a decade-long responsible growth model and relationship nature of our franchise. During
quarter one, importantly, our organic growth engine continued to perform.
Let me first summarize some points and then I'll turn it over to Alastair to take you through the details of the
quarter. If you go to slide 2 of the materials, Bank of America delivered strong earnings, growing EPS 18% over
first quarter 2022. Every business segment performed well. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a
strong pace. We delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage, led by a 13% year-over-year of
revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet with our CET1 ratio increasing to 11.4%, regulatory
capital ended the highest nominal level in our history to $184 billion.
We maintained strong liquidity. We ended the quarter with more than $900 billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We
earned good returns for you as our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%, a 107 basis
points return on average assets. Tangible book value per share grew 9% year-over-year. We did this as the
economy slowed and remember our research team continues to predict a shallow recession that will occur
beginning in the quarter three of 2023.
It would be interesting to look at our consumer behavior, payments by consumer continues to drive the US
economy. We've seen debit and credit card spending at about 6% year-over-year growth pace, a little slower but
still healthy. But remember card spending represents less than a quarter of how consumers pay for things out of
their accounts of Bank of America. Overall payments from our customers' accounts across all sources were up
9% year-over-year for March as a month. Year-to-date, they're up about 8% for the quarter.
After slowing in the back half of 2022 a bit, we saw the pace of payments pick back up in quarter one especially in
the latter parts of the quarter. Consumers' financial positions remains generally healthy. They are employed with
generally higher wages, continue to have strong account balances and have good access to credit.
As you think through all the tightening actions of the Fed, the flows to alternative yielding assets, investments, and
the disruptions of the past quarter, our deposits continued to perform well ending the quarter at $1.91 trillion. If
you think about it, that's about the same balance that we had in mid-October of 2022, so we've seen these
balances stabilize and remain 34% above they were and prior to the pandemic. The team has managed well
during these periods while remaining focused on the things we can control to drive value through our franchise. I
thank them for a very strong quarter, near record earnings with strong returns.
Let me turn the call over to Alastair to walk through the details of the quarter.

Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian. And I'll pick up on slide 3 where we list some of the more detailed highlights of the quarter and
then on slide 4, we present the summary income statement, so I'm going to refer to both of these together.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
As Brian mentioned, for the quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of net income and that resulted in $0.94 per diluted
share. Our revenue grew 13% and that was led by a 25% improvement in net interest income, coupled with strong
9% growth in sales and trading results excluding DVA.
Our non-interest revenue was strong despite three headwinds. First, we had lower service charges as commercial
clients paid lower fees for Treasury services since they now receive higher earned rates on balances. And
obviously that allows us to invest those funds to earn NII. On Consumer, we had lower NSF insufficient funds in
overdraft fees as a result of our policy changes announced in late 2021. Second, we had lower asset
management fees and that just reflects the lower equity market levels and fixed income market levels. And third,
investment banking fees were lower just reflecting the continuation of sluggish industry activity and reduced fee
pools. Now all that said, despite these headwinds each of the fee categories saw modest improvement from the
fourth quarter levels.
Asset quality remained strong and provision expense for the quarter was $931 million. That consisted of $807
million of net charge-offs and $124 million of reserve build. And that reserve build compares to reserve release in
the first quarter 2022 of $362 million. Our charge-off rate was 32 basis points and still well below the fourth
quarter of 2019, when our pre-pandemic rate was 39 basis points. And remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low,
so credit obviously remains quite strong.
I want to make one other point on slide 4 and that is simply to note that pre-tax, pre-provision income grew 27%
year-over-year compared to reported net income growth of 15%.
So let's turn to the balance sheet that starts on slide 5. And you can see during the quarter our balance sheet
increased $144 billion to $3.195 trillion. Brian noted our liquidity levels at the end of the period, those rose to more
than $900 billion from December 31st. That's $23 billion higher and it remains $324 billion above our pre-
pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Shareholders' equity increased $7 billion from the fourth quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital
distributed to shareholders, and we saw an improvement in AOCI of $3 billion due to lower long-term interest
rates. The AOCI included more than half a billion increase from improved valuations of AFS debt securities and
that flows through CET1. And the remaining $2.5 billion due to changes in cash flow hedges, doesn't impact
regulatory capital. During the quarter we paid $1.8 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.2 billion in
shares.
Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $184 billion since December 31, and our CET1 ratio
improved 14 basis points to 11.4%, once again adding to our buffer over our 10.4% current minimum requirement,
as well as the 10.9% minimum requirement that we'll see on January 1st of 2024. That means in the past 12
months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 100 basis points and we've supported our clients and we've returned
$12 billion in capital to shareholders. CET1 capital improved $4 billion and that reflects the benefit of earnings and
the AOCI improvement, partially offset by the capital we returned to shareholders.
Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that partially offset the benefit to the CET1 ratio of the higher
capital we generated. And then our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6%. That compares to a minimum
requirement of 5% and leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains
comfortably above our requirements.
But let's spend a minute on loan growth and we'll do that by turning to slide 6, where you can see that average
loans grew 7% year-over-year, driven by Commercial loans and credit card growth. The credit card growth
4

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
reflects increased marketing. It reflects enhanced offers and higher levels of card account openings. The
Commercial growth across the past year reflects the diversity of Commercial activity across Global Banking and
Global Markets and to some degree, Global Wealth. And on a more near-term linked quarter basis, loans grew at
a much slower pace, partly driven by seasonal credit card pay-downs after the fourth quarter holiday spending.
And then Commercial demand slowed in Q1 and we saw some pay-downs by our Wealth Management clients as
they lowered leverage as rates rose.
So let's turn to deposits and there's obviously been a lot of additional focus this quarter, so I want to spend extra
time here and I'm going to start with slide 7 and talk about average deposits. Just a few points we need to make
before focusing on a more detailed discussion of the recent trends. Average total deposits for the first quarter
were $1.89 trillion. That is down 2% linked quarter and down 7% year-over-year. Our deposits peaked in the
fourth quarter of 2021 and even as the Fed has continued to withdraw money supply, our deposits have held
around $1.9 trillion because there's a lot more industry deposits today in a much fig bigger economy today
compared to pre-pandemic.
Our average deposits were up 34% compared to our pre-pandemic Q4 2019 balance and the industry's deposits
were up 31% to 17.4 trillion, so we've obviously fared a little bit better than the industry. We put our pre-pandemic
deposits for each line of business on the slide, so you can compare our balances then and now. I want to highlight
Consumer checking balances which remained 53% higher than pre-pandemic. And as I think all of us would
expect, GWIM combined client deposits are up a lesser 23% as those are the clients that generally move their
excess cash into other off-balance sheet products. And in Global Banking you can see the rotation to interest
bearing across time as rates rose.
But let's get a little more granular and a little more near term, and we'll use slide 8 for that where you can see the
breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters. You can also see that we
plotted the timeline of Fed target and rate hikes on the top left chart, just for comparison through time. In the
upper left, you can see the trend of our total deposits. We ended Q1 2023 at $1.91 trillion. That's down 1%. And
as Brian mentioned over the course of the past 6 months, those balances have been relatively stable.
In Consumer, looking at the top right chart, we show the difference here in the movement through the quarter
between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher yielding non-checking accounts, and
across the entire quarter we saw modest $4 billion decline in total. Checking balances obviously had some
variability around paydays in particular, but note the relative stability of checking deposits, because these are the
operational accounts with money in motion to pay the bills and everyday living costs for families. I'd also point out
that our checking balances were modestly growing even ahead of March 9th upheaval and continued to move
higher through the quarter on the back of disruption. Lower non-checking balances mostly reflect money moved
out of deposits and into brokerage accounts where we earn a small fee.
Rate paid increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter to 12 basis points on this trillion dollars of total
Consumer deposits and remains low, because of the 52% mix that is checking. Lastly, I'd just note that the rate
movements in this business are concentrated in the small CDs and Consumer investment deposits, which
together represent about 5% of the deposits.
In Wealth Management, as you would expect, it shows the most relative decline and you can see the continued
trend of clients moving money from lower yielding sweep accounts into higher yielding preferred deposits and off-
balance sheet to other investment alternatives. Now if we went back further, you'd see that roughly $90 billion has
moved out of sweeps in the past year, which leaves $80 billion in these accounts. So you can see how with the
pace and size and rate hikes slowing, we expect the declines in balances to lessen from here.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposit movement where we hold about $500 billion in customer
deposits. These are generally operational deposits of our Commercial customers and they use that to manage
their cash flows through the course of the year. Those are down $3 billion from the fourth quarter and what's
interesting to note is that our total deposits in this segment have been stable at around $500 billion for the past six
months and this business just continues to see rotation into interest bearing. The mix of interest bearing deposits
on an ending basis, moved from 49% last quarter to 55% in Q1 and obviously, we paid increased rates on those
interest-bearing deposits. And it's this rotation in Global Banking that's driving the rotational shift of the total
company and it's pretty typical and to be expected in this environment.
So, in summary, deposits continue to behave as we would expect. The cash transactional balances have shown
some recent stabilization. And for investment cash, we've seen deposits move to brokerage and other platforms
for direct holdings of money market, mutual funds, Treasuries, and we're capturing many of those flows as you
see in our numbers. It's just we expect that to slow going forward.
So now that we've examined trends for the different lines of business, I want to make some important points about
the characteristics of our deposit franchise using slide 9 and this will just help reinforce for shareholders who own
Bank of America that they're investing in one of the world's great deposit franchises, all of it based off of
relationships we have with our customers and the value they place on the award-winning capabilities and
convenience they have access to.
Starting from the top, focus first on Consumer. You can see that more than 80% of deposits have been with us for
more than 5 years and more than two-thirds of our Consumer deposits are balances with customers who have
had relationships with the bank for more than ten years. Also, more than three-quarters of those customers are
very highly engaged in their activities with us. They're also geographically disbursed across the United States
given our presence in 83 of the top 100 markets. Lastly, whether you look at Consumers or Small Business, the
value proposition is what is driving the same result. We've got long-tenured customers with deep relationships
that are highly engaged.
Turning to Wealth Management, you can see a similar story around long tenure and quite active relationships.
The average relationship of our GWIM clients is around 14 years and again these clients are very geographically
diverse. They're also very digitally engaged and we continue to see deepening around banking solutions and
products of all types. There is lots of options for these clients that extend from their operational checking accounts
all the way up through preferred deposit options and then we also benefit from having great alternatives from
them within our investment platform.
On Global Banking, note that 80% of our US deposit balances are held by clients who's have had an account with
us for at least 10 years. Furthermore, as we measure the number of solutions that clients have with us, we know
that 73% of balances are held by clients that have at least five products on us and just like the other businesses
they're highly diversified by industry and geography. So those are some of the things that make our quality
deposit base stable.
So now that we've walked through both loans and deposits, I want to transition a bit to make some points on
balance sheet management and to focus on the liquidity we enjoy by having a surplus of customer deposits that
far exceeds the loan demand of our clients today and far exceeded the loan demand of our clients pre-pandemic.
Having the deposits alone doesn't pay the expenses to support these great customer bases and it doesn't mean
much to our shareholders unless we put them to work to extract the value of those deposits. So that's what we're
trying to illustrate and we want to show you how we do that.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
You can see that on slide 10, where you note we had significant excess deposits over loans pre-pandemic. And
during the pandemic that amount increased significantly. Before the pandemic, we had half a trillion more in
deposits than loans and that peaked in late 2021 at more than $1.1 trillion and it remains high at roughly $900
billion still today. That's the context as we talk about how we manage excess cash.
So let's turn to slide 11. And here we're going to focus on the banking book, because our Global Markets balance
sheet has remained largely market funded. And just follow the graph from left to right. At the top of the slide, you
note trend of cash and cash equivalents, and the two components of the debt securities balances available for
sale and held to maturity. And you can see the trend of the overall combined cash and securities balance
movement and it closely mirrors the previous slides excess deposit trend as you would expect.
In 2020 deposits grew while loans declined and that was pandemic borrowing from our Commercial clients
stopping and then quickly paying it off. Throughout 2020 as we put deposits to work, we took a number of actions
to protect our capital and that included a buildup in hold-to-maturity, better aligning our capital treatment with our
intent to hold those securities to maturity. We also hedged rate risk in the available-for-sale book using pay fixed
received variable swaps. So, these securities acted like cash and they earned higher yields and guarded against
capital volatility.
As we entered the middle of 2021, it became more clear that the stimulus payment would likely be the last one
and therefore we believed deposits would be peaking. As a result, we stopped adding to our hold-to-maturity
securities book. That book peaked in the third quarter of 2021 at $683 billion, $562 million were mortgage backed
and the rest were Treasuries. And all that's happened is that notional balances have declined in each of the past
six quarters, ending the quarter at $625 billion, and within that the mortgage-backed portfolio is down $67 billion
to $495 billion.
As rates began to rise quickly throughout 2022, the value of our deposits rose. And at the same time the
disclosed market value of the hold-to-maturity has declined, resulting in a negative market valuation on those
bonds. That negative market valuation peaked in the third quarter, came down in the fourth quarter, and it's come
down another $10 billion in the first quarter.
In our 10-K disclosure, we include a chart which shows the maturity distribution of our securities portfolio. And I'd
remind you this is based on the maturity dates of those originations, i.e., the date of the last contractual payment.
When we look at the actual cash flows of those bonds over time, it results in an average weighted life of the hold-
to-maturity securities book of a little more than eight years. And as you can see since the third quarter of 2021,
we've continued to see increases in the overall yield on the balances due to both the maturity and reinvestment of
lower yielding securities, as well as remix into higher yielding cash. And as you can see with deposits paying 92
basis points that compares to our blend of cash and government guaranteed securities, which pays 290 basis
points, so we continued to benefit NII and yield.
And finally one very important last point I want to make, which is on the improved NII of our banking book.
Because remember, we manage the entirety of our balance sheet that includes our deposits and that's where you
see the net interest income has improved significantly. NII, excluding Global Markets which we disclose each
quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion and it's now $5.4 billion higher on a quarterly basis at
$14.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, and that's the acid test of managing the entire balance sheet.
So let's turn now to slide 12 and focus on net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in the first quarter
was $14.4 billion and the FTE NII number was $14.6 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.9
7

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
billion from the first quarter of 2022, or 25%, while our net interest yield improved 51 basis points to 2.2%. The
improvement was driven by rates and that includes reductions in securities premium amortization. Average Fed
fund rates are up 440 basis points year-over-year. Relative to that increase in Fed funds which has benefited all
of our variable rate assets, the rate paid on our total deposits rose 89 basis points. And the rate paid today on
interest bearing deposits is up 133 basis points. Average loan growth of $64 billion also aided the year-over-year
NII improvement.
Turning to a linked quarter discussion, NII of $14.6 billion is down $222 million from Q4. And that's primarily driven
by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and the mix shift into interest bearing. It's also influenced by
lower Global Markets NII, which remember still gets passed through to clients via higher non-interest income as
part of the trading revenue. Excluding the $262 million decline in Global Markets NII, the banking book NII of
$14.5 billion that was modestly higher as the benefit of increased short interest rates, some modest loan growth
and some deposit favorability, was offset by two less days of interest in the quarter.
Turning to asset sensitivity on a forward basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift on March 31st stands at $3.3
billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book. 96% of that sensitivity is driven by short
rates.
In summary the first quarter NII was $14.6 billion in this quarter on an FTE basis and that was a little better than
our $14.4 billion expectation as we began the quarter, since deposits and rate pass-throughs were both modestly
better. Looking forward, based on everything we know about interest rates and customer behavior, we expect
second quarter NII on an FTE basis to be around 2% lower compared to Q1. So think about that NII as about
$14.3 billion FTE, plus or minus, driven by expected deposit movements as well as lower Global Markets NII
which again is offset in trading revenue.
So let me remind you of some of the caveats when it comes do that NII guidance. First, importantly, it assumes
that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and that includes one more hike and then a couple of cuts in
2023. We also expect funding costs for Global Markets client activity to continue to increase based on those high
rates, and as noted the impact of that is still offset in non-interest income and that obviously assumes our current
client positioning and the forward rate expectations.
We continue to expect modest loan growth, so that's in our NII expectation as well. And it's driven by credit card
and to a lesser degree, Commercial. And then finally we just expect lower deposits and rotational shifts towards
interest bearing, really for three reasons. First, we expect further Fed balance sheet reductions to continue to
reduce deposits for the industry. Second, we anticipate lower Wealth Management deposits in the second
quarter. That's pretty typical due to the seasonal impact of clients paying income taxes, and to a lesser degree
now, a continuation of balance movement seeking better yields off-balance sheet. And third, we just continue to
expect some of the rotation of Commercial deposits towards interest bearing.
Okay. Let's go to slide 13, we'll talk about expense. And here what you can see is in the first quarter, our
expenses were $16.2 billion. That's up $700 million from the fourth quarter and it's driven by seasonal elevation
from payroll taxes, mostly of $450 million. A little bit from higher FDIC insurance expense, that was another $100
million in this quarter and the cost of adding people, call that another $100 million.
We ended the first quarter with a little more than 217,000 people with the company. That was 260 people more
than year-end. During the quarter, we welcomed 3,000 additional people into the company in January. That's due
to outstanding offers that we extended in the fourth quarter. That meant that our head count peaked in January at
a little more than 218,000 and at the end of last week, we were down to 216,000. We continue to expect that to
8


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
move lower over time and we expect by the end of the second quarter, our full-time equivalent head count will be
roughly 213,000 excluding our summer interns.
As we look forward to the next quarter then, we would expect Q2 expense to benefit from the reduction of the
seasonal elevation of payroll tax in Q1 and we would also expect to see expense reductions coming from head
count reductions through attrition over time and our operational excellence work. So we expect expense in Q2 to
be around $400 million or $500 million lower than Q1. So think of that as around $15.8 billion, plus or minus, in
Q2. And then further, we just expect continued sequential expense declines in the third quarter and then again in
the fourth quarter as we benefit from continued head count discipline and attrition through time.
We'll turn to asset quality on slide 14 and I want to start the credit discussion by saying once again, asset quality
of our customers remains healthy and net charge-offs continue to rise from their near historic lows. Net charge-
offs of $807 million, increased $118 million from the fourth quarter. That increase was driven by credit card losses
as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate
was 2.21% in this first quarter and that compares to 3.03% in the fourth quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic.
Provision expense was $931 million in Q1 and that included $124 million reserve build. That's obviously less than
the $403 million build we took in the fourth quarter and it reflects modest loan growth and an ever so slightly
improved macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate still north
of 5% as we end 2023.
We included a slide in the appendix this quarter that highlights the mix and credit metrics of our commercial real
estate exposure. And I just wanted to remind everyone here, we've been very intentional around our client
selection, very intentional around portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years. And as a result,
we've seen NPLs and realized losses that remain quite low for this portfolio. We had a total of $66 million of
commercial real estate losses in 2022. 70% of that was in office loans and that resulted in an annualized loss rate
of 26 basis points. In the first quarter, to give some perspective, our office loan losses were $15 million.
We have roughly $73 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding. That's less than 7% of our loan book. It's
highly diversified by geography and no part of the country represents more than 22% of the book, it's also very
diversified across property type. Within property type, our office portfolio is $19 billion, it's about 2% of our total
loans. The portfolio is roughly 75% Class A properties and when we originate, they're typically around 55% loan to
value. Even though we've seen some property value declines, these exposures still remain well secured. $3.6
billion is classified as reservable criticized, and even on the most recent refreshes on our toughest loans, we still
have 75% LTVs.
In our office book, $4 billion is scheduled to mature this year, another $6 billion in 2024, with the remainder
spread over the following years. So we continue to feel that the portfolio is well-positioned and adequately
reserved given the current conditions.
On slide 15 for completeness, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial
portfolios. And with that I'm going to turn it back to Brian to talk about the lines of business.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Alastair. And we're going to begin on slide 16. So, I want to bring us back to the things that drive the
long-term value of this franchise and the value for you, our shareholders. Every business segment grew
9

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
customers and accounts organically in the quarter and used digital tools and capabilities to drive engagement
even deeper and also to drive customer satisfaction to industry-leading levels.
On slide 16, we've highlighted some of the important elements of organic growth. I won't go through all the line
items here, but in Consumer, we opened 130,000 net new checking accounts, 1.3 million credit card accounts
and 9% more investment accounts that aided to record quarter one Consumer investment flows. Consumer also
has had 17 quarters of positive net new checking accounts. In Global Wealth, we had a record quarter, adding
14,500 net new wealth relationships. In Global Banking, we added clients, increased the number of products per
relationship. In Global Markets, as we said earlier, Jimmy DeMare and team had one of the highest quarters of
sales and trading.
The other elements of earnings the management team remains focused on throughout this inflationary
environment is our expense management efforts, but even given those we continue to make investments in the
future. We continued the streak of operating leverage in our company and you can see that in slide 17. We now
have had seven quarters of operating leverage. The efficiency ratio went to 62%. And the nominal dollars of
expenses we have today, are similar to what we had 8, 9, 10 years ago.
As we go to slide 18, let's talk about individual businesses and Consumer banking first. For the quarter,
Consumer banking earned $3.1 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its eighth consecutive
quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in the future. Top line revenue grew 21%.
Expenses rose 11%. These results demonstrate the true value of the $1 trillion deposit franchise and the deep
relationship we have with the clients in that business. The business continues to have $700 billion in excess
deposits over its loan balances. And as we said earlier, grew checking accounts 2.5 million new checking
accounts since the pandemic started.
Solid earnings growth of 4% understates the success of this business as prior year included reserve releases,
while we built reserves this quarter. On a pre-tax, pre-provision basis, PPNR grew 34% year-over-year. I will also
note that the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges, as a result of us lowering our NSFOD
charges for customers several quarters ago.
The expenses in the Consumers reflect the continued business investments through growth, including adding
relationship associates for the increases in the cost to technology and implementation of new tools. As you think
about this business, remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes during 2022, the ones we made
mid-year in addition to our margin, $25 an hour, impact this business more than any other business. However,
this helped drive the attrition in this business in half compared to last year this quarter.
On slide 19, you can see some of the digital statistics around Consumer. We believe that those digital tools our
customers have access to are the key to growing and retaining customer relationships. These tools also help us
deliver more efficiently. We now have 45 million users active engaged on our digital properties. They log in one
billion times a month. Erica, our artificial intelligence driven personal assistant, saw usage rise 35% just in the
past year, and the number of customers using Zelle grew 21% in the past year. Remember, these aren't new
functionalities just being put in place, these are growing off a high scale and show the Bank of America impact on
these products. On Zelle, remember, back in mid-2021, Zelle transactions crossed the number of checks written
for our clients. Now it's 60% higher, less than two years later. And you can see the growth in digital sales that
continues. The main focus on growing the customer base and delivering the best-in-class tools and service that
make us more efficient and more important to our clients in the Consumer business and Dean Athanasia and the
team continue to do a good job with respect to those goals.

On slide 20, we move to Wealth Management. They had results, earning about a little over $900 million after-tax
in the quarter. These results were down from last year, as Alastair said, as asset management fees fell with a
negative market levels in equity and fixed income. Those fees were mitigated by the beneficial impact of revenue
from the sizable banking business within this line of business for us. As I noted a moment ago, both Merrill and
the Private Bank saw organic revenue growth and provided solid client flows of $25 billion in the quarter. Our
assets under management flows, $15 billion, reflect some of the movement in deposits noted earlier. But we also
saw $33 billion of brokerage flows. Expenses reflect lower revenue-related incentives, but also reflect continued
investments in the business as we continue to add financial advisors. We've added more than 650 wealth
advisors in the past year alone. As we move forward, we're excited to have Eric Schimpf and Lindsay Hans lead
this business. They'll work closely with Katy Knox to drive our Global Wealth and Investment Management
business across the company.
As we go to Global Wealth Investment Management Digital on slide 21, you can see the statistics here. Just as
with the Consumer business, these clients become more and more digitally engaged across time. Our advisors
have led the way in driving a personal-driven advice model, supplemented by our digital tools. On slide 21, you
can see the client digital adoption rate of 84% with Merrill, and the Private Bank is over 90%. More than 75%
embraced digital delivery of their statements, which as a key tool or service providing more convenience for them
and our advisor. Erica and Zelle interactions continue to grow here also, even among these wealthy clients.
On slide 22, you see the Global Banking results. This business produced very strong results, growing revenue
19% year-to-year to $6.2 billion. The business earned $2.6 billion after-tax. While investment banking remained
sluggish, our Global Treasury services business has been robust, leading to strong revenue performance. Loan
activity has been good across this business also. As noted earlier, the deposit flows appear to have stabilized in
March and we benefited from some customer flows during the flight to safety during the quarter. The company's
overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in quarter one, and while down from quarter one 2022, we saw
modest improvement from quarter four 2022. Provision expense declined year-over-year as prior year's reserve
builds compared to release in the current period. The credit quality of this business, again remains very strong.
Expense increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strategic investments in the business including relationship
management hiring and technology costs.
Digital engagement is shown on slide 23 with our Global Banking customers. These Commercial customers
continue to grow in importance as Treasuries and others appreciate ease of doing business with us with through
these tools. While the volume of transactions, the sheer number isn't the same as Consumer, the volume of
money moved is tremendous.
Next business we'll go to is our Global Markets business on slide 24. Jimmy DeMare and the team had another
strong quarter of results, growing year-over-year earnings to nearly $1.7 billion after-tax. The continued themes of
inflation due to political tensions and central bank's changing monetary policies around the globe, drove volatility
in the bond and equity markets, which this team did a good job of managing. As a result, it was a quarter we saw
a strong performance in our credit trading business, particularly in mortgages and muni trading and macro trading,
again fared well buoyed by strong client activity and secured financing. Investments made in this business over
the last few years continued to produce favorable results. This focus on net sales and trading numbers alone, ex
DVA, revenue improved 9% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. FICC improved 29%, while equities were down 19%
compared to quarter one of 2022. Year-over-year expense increased 8%, primarily driven by continued
investments as stated in this business.
Finally on slide 25, you can see the All Other shows a modest loss, which included the $220 million of losses in
securities sold, as Alastair mentioned earlier. And last, I would note our 10% effective tax rate this quarter
11

continues to benefit us from a strong business with clients, supporting environmental investments and housing
investments to produce tax benefits. Excluding those and the other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have
been 26%.
So in summary, a strong quarter by our team delivering for you, our shareholders, operating leverage, organic
growth, strong credit, capital return and strong ROTCE.
With that, let's jump to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instruction] We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just one question on the NII's trajectory. You guys remain asset sensitive in the
banking book, but the forward curve is, I think you pointed out, that currently expects three rate cuts by the end of
the year. If that plays out, how do you think about that impact on NII in the back half of the year? What are the
puts and takes as we think about NII beyond 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Jim, I think, right now the expectations for the market in terms of whether or not there will be another hike in
May, that's bouncing around pretty good. Similarly, you've got a question of whether or not there's two cuts at the
back half or three. So we're operating with the same information you are. We're looking at the forward curve day
to day, thinking that through. At the same time we're looking at our deposit balances, they're performing kind of
the way we would think. And we're competing for rate paid. So, and I'd say generally speaking at this point, we
feel pretty good about NII. It's obviously going to be up this year, up pretty significantly. And we don't provide
guidance for a full year for a very simple reason. It just comes down to – it's very difficult to predict what the Fed is
going to do six months and nine months out. But look at this way. We can see where consensus is, consensus is
right around $57 billion, plus or minus. That's the sort of number that would imply us, up for the year 7% to 8%. I
mean, I think we're pretty comfortable there. But it's just so many moving parts, that's why we don't provide the
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
No. That's all fair. And maybe just pivoting to the trading business, you had another strong quarter and
outperformed peers in the fixed income business. Is there anything unusually strong there, or do you believe you
guys have made some sustainable market share gains in that business given your recent investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think the team is doing a really good job, Brian talked about that. A couple years ago, we made a decision
as a team that it was important for us to invest more in that business, and we did that. And we've made pretty
12


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
significant investments in equities and in fixed income. And we felt like, in particular, we could continue to grow
our macro businesses which we've done, and that's what has done a really good job until this quarter. This
quarter we just happened to fire on more cylinders, particularly in FICC, because this quarter we had a great
quarter for our micro products. And you kind of expect that because it was a better quarter for them. We had
positive returns there. So mortgages, credit, munis, financing, futures, FX, all of them had a pretty good quarter.
And I think Jim and the team are just executing at a really high level. So they just got to keep at it.

Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Alastair, just a clarification. You gave us the quarterly expected trajectory for expenses, do you
still expect to hit $62.5 billion or so of full-year expenses in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Right now that's our expectation. We're 90 days into the quarter, into the year rather. Obviously as we're looking
forward, we see – we know the head count is coming down. So that's going to be a tailwind all the way through
the course of the year. So, we don't have any change in our expectations right now. We're going to see how the
year develops. We've still got a little bit of a headwind in terms of something like our sales and trading business
having a very good revenue year and we're still investing in the business. So it will be a dog fight particularly as
we get into the back half of the year. But we still feel good about where we are with respect to expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is for Brian. Now Brian, you produced a significant amount of revenue this quarter
and grew your CET1. At the same time I think that a lot of investors are looking down the path of significant macro
uncertainty. As we take that into account, how should we think about the buyback activity going forward,
especially ahead of the stress test result in June?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, you saw this quarter we continue to adopt our basic – apply our basic principles, which is, we support the
growth in our customer base. We pay the dividends that we think is a rational rate and then we use the rest to
basically return to you through share buybacks. We're in the middle of a stress test, as you just mentioned, we'll
have to see the results of that. We also – but the good news is we crossed 11.40% this quarter which basically is
an excess. It has a cushion on top of what we need for the first quarter of next year. And so, we'll continue to
follow our basic principles. So we feel very good about our capital and you should expect us to continue to follow
the idea to pay the dividend or grow organic – support the organic growth, pay the dividend and buy back shares.
But we've got to get through the near-term sort of what goes on in our business every year at this time.

Operator: We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Hey, I'm just wondering on the deposit side, can you help us understand, there's obviously the
ongoing mix shift which you referred to and gave us a lot of great detail on. I'm just wondering, as you think
forward, how much more mix shift are you expecting in terms of DVAs as a percentage of total deposits? And how
do you expect that to also look as you think across the businesses with regards to just where customers are
moving funds incrementally? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I think Ken, we think this – everybody thinks this is a big bulk thing, Bank of America, but it's really – and
then looks at broad categories, interest bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts and [indiscernible] (00:48:04).
You have to really think about customer bases and what they do with their money. And so there's transactional
cash whether that's for consumer running their household day-to-day, a wealthy consumer running their
household day-to-day, which may have different level of expenses. And then the commercial customers who run
their business day-to-day and then have excess cash from that if they're successful and then how they all play
that through. So, we think transactional cash as investment cash. You've seen a lot of the investment cash just,
so to speak as Alastair mentioned earlier, we price competitively for that moves around. But the good news is we
have a massive investment platform where we put that money to work for our customers if they don't need it to
manage their day-to-day household.
So, our NII estimates, our view of what happens in the future, I think the key for the Consumer business is to
remember that it's got $700 billion of excess deposits over its loans. It's generating a lot of excess deposits. That
grew $300 billion-odd from pre-pandemic. It has been stable. The checking balances, if you look at those charts
we gave you, they show you the near-term movement are stable. That generates at a total all-in cost of 10 to 15
basis points, a lot of the value in a franchise and meaning, including the interest bearing part of that franchise that
when you think about deposits across time and then like businesses. So, you'd expect some of those trends to
continue in terms of customers have excess cash putting it to work differently. We expect the deposit rates to
move, to continue to match the market. But the broad value of this deposit franchise is driven by the money
people leave us, because it's transactional cash which is a motion and we don't pay interest on, and that is both
the consumers and wealthy customers of businesses. So it's hard – it's a very detailed question of which we
spend a lot of time looking at or the team does as you might imagine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And the other question is just then, Alastair, you walked through how you've been changing the
composition of the securities portfolio and still benefiting from those variable rate swaps. I'm just wondering if you
can help us understand what happens from here in terms of – or should you continue to get benefits from those
variable rate swaps? And then also, just have you done any positioning, repositioning underneath the surface? It
14

looks like there were just some securities losses. So how much room do you have to continue to, to kind of rework
the portfolio and grind more income out of the book even as you shrink it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So Ken, think about – I mean, the easiest way to think about those Treasuries they're swapped to floating,
so they're essentially cash. And actually this quarter we ended up converting some of them into cash, just
because it's simpler. It's simpler for everyone to understand, and there's obviously a pretty good bid for Treasuries
this quarter. So we just converted them into cash. That's what accounted for some of the securities loss there. It
was a couple of hundred million. But I think the way to think about it is, as the overall securities portfolio,
remember, we've got cash, we've got available for sale, and you can always think about that as enhanced cash,
and then we've got hold-to-maturity. As that continues to pay down, we're just sweeping it right now into cash.
That's something I've talked about in the last couple quarters. And we're putting in cash, because number one, it's
a really high-yielding asset. Number two, it gives us a lot of options during a period of volatility. So, pretty straight-
forward at this point.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well I guess the topic of the day, week and the month is, to what degree are your assets matched with your
liabilities? And I'm staring at slide 11 and you've seen the front page of many papers highlighting your unrealized
securities losses. You highlight the yield on your securities at 2.6%. You highlighted your held-to-maturity portfolio
at eight years. That would all suggest to some that you're not so well-matched. On the other hand, what you don't
provide or at least I didn't see it, the change in the value of your deposits or even the duration of your deposits. So
the basic question is, can you describe to what degree your assets are matched with your liabilities, and where
you think you may have been off or on the mark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, so, Mike, I'll start. Brian can add anything he chooses to. But one of the reasons we that we spent as much
time laying out the deposit franchise is because in a rising rate environment, you'd expect obviously that bond
markets are going to turn negative. And at the same time, you and we have been expecting as rates go up, the
NII would rise, because the deposits are so much more valuable in that environment. What we laid out for you
and for everyone to see is, just how broad and stable and diversified is this deposit base. We think it's very long
tenured. That's why we're laying out some of these things around just around how long the relationships are in
Consumer and in Wealth and in Global Banking. And it's one of the reasons...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, Alastair, if I can just interrupt. When you say long tenured, can you put any numbers around that, a range is
– I think that's the one biggest most important number. If you could just, some kind of frame that a little bit?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, if you took a look at slide number 9, we've tried to lay that out for you. So you take a look at, and
Consumer, for example, you're talking about 67% of the clients have been with us for more than ten years. That's
pretty long tenured. I know from my time in the Commercial Bank, our clients on average were 17 years with us.
You have long operational deposits in all of these businesses. So that's what we're trying to lay out in front of
everyone so you can see that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I'm sorry. I interrupted, but go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

{Multiple Speakers] (00:54:16)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
No, I think what I'm trying to convey to you too, Mike, and you know how this works. We've got to balance all of
this, because we have to think about the entire balance sheet. And there's a lot going on with the entire balance
sheet. And so, what we're trying to do is invest that excess which has existed now in hundreds of billions for
many, many years. We've got to invest it the best way we can. And the way we do that, we talk about balancing it
is, number one trying to make sure grow capital. We've done that, we're up 100 basis points there in the last year.
Number two, we're trying to grow liquidity, we added $22 billion in this past quarter. Number three, we're trying to
grow earnings, we're at $8.2 billion. It's one of our best quarters ever. So look, we can always be better. You
know that we're taking the portfolio and just making it smaller, it's run off now six quarters in a row. We're taking
all of that and plowing it into cash and loans. That's what we've been doing. We'll just continue doing that, and the
portfolio is going to get smaller and shorter over time.
And when you look at the asset sensitivity now relative to rates going up a 100 or rates going down a 100, we're
pretty balanced there too. We're sort of up $3.3 billion if rates go up a 100. We're down $3.6 billion if rates go
down a 100. So, we feel like we're in a pretty balanced place and a lot of flexibility at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just a follow-up, I guess some will take your greatest strength as a weakness, that is you don't pay as
much on deposits as others. I estimate that you have the lowest cycle-to-date deposit beta. And so, what is it that
keeps your customers around if you're not going to pay them as much?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think if you look at the value proposition that we're talking about, if you go to the Consumer business for
example, they've invested so much in client experience, whether it's the financial centers, renovation, whether it's
the people that we've added in that business over a long period of time, whether it's the digital, the mobile,
preferred rewards, ours is a relationship model and it has been. And if you look then, like just think about this
quarter, look at the organic growth in Consumer again. That's 130,000 net new checking, 17 quarters in a row,
based on that relationship value proposition. That's what we're attracting. If you go to the Wealth Management
business, this was a record quarter for net new households for Merrill Lynch and a record for the Private Bank,
this quarter. That tells you we're offering people something that's valuable. And then we added 35,000 new bank
accounts for people in our Wealth Management franchise. So that again is a significant indicator that what we're
offering has value to people. And if I were to go back to my old business in Business Banking and Commercial
Banking, they're adding new logos and new clients over time in a way that we're really happy with right now.
So I think, the ultimate answer is we are a purpose-driven company who put our clients' interest first. That is
helping make their financial lives better. And in this period of time, people want stability and that's what we offer.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks. Maybe an easy one up first, it wasn't noticeable but do you feel like there was a flight to quality benefit
during the March Madness? I would have thought that people would have flocked to the safety of BofA during
times like that, but you didn't comment specifically on that. So, thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, we're going to decline, Glenn, to give a specific number. We're pretty confident we saw noticeable flight to
safety. And it comes in two parts. Part 1 is, during a period like March 10 and around that week or two. And then
there's a second part that comes with onboarding clients over a period of time who are trying to move operational
accounts here, and that takes a while. That has a lag. So you can think about, we get some of the deposits quite
quickly, but relationships take a longer time to build and onboard. So you can see from our numbers it was
improving before the disruption. We've chosen not to put an exact number on it, because there are typical ebbs
and flows in any given quarter leading up, especially to a payroll end of quarter. But generally speaking, I'd say,
we were improving anyway. A lot of that is just organic growth, but we obviously benefited.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And you noted though, one more hike and then cuts to the back half of the year. That's the forward curve.
What's interesting is the Fed doesn't have the same forward curve as the market has. So I'm curious if you could
talk to the sensitivity of what if there are no cuts? How much of that helps your forward NII thought process?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we do use the forward curve, because we feel like it's the most kind of dispassionate assessment with the
most information out there in the market from the broader set of people. And importantly, it's not just us making it
up. So we use the forward curve. And I even mentioned during my remarks, things are bouncing around, around
is it one hike, is it zero, is it two cuts? But the sensitivity that we provide around up a 100 or down a 100 is
probably the best we can offer at this stage. And then, depending on how things develop and they're developing
quickly, it will allow you to adjust the model accordingly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
The last simple one is, held-to-maturity, you talked a lot about it. I think the answer is, I know it, but I'll ask it
bluntly anyway. So you don't feel like you have to do anything material with your unrealized loss which is, I get it,
it's in Treasuries, it's swap, it's Agency mortgages, but not a credit issue. But at this point, given the stability of
your deposit base, loan growth, capital growth, do you feel like you can just kind of ride it out and grind it down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Correct. Right now that's exactly what we've been doing. We've communicated that pretty clearly, and that's what
we're continuing to do. It just keeps getting smaller and shorter.

So, Alastair, you had mentioned some of the strong KPIs that you're seeing within GWIM. At the same time, the
business did see a pretty material decline in pre-tax margins, both sequentially and year-on-year. I wanted to
better understand how the business might evolve under some of the new leadership and how we should just be
thinking about the margin trajectory. Wanted to better understand how you're balancing investment needs with the
goal of delivering continued profitability.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
The margin came down largely because you had the sort of incremental hit to the investment side, revenue as the
markets fell year-over-year. But we'd expect that margin to move back up to its more traditional 25% to 30%. But
you also have to remember they are a big beneficiary or hit of the elevated payroll taxes and other things in the
first quarter, because as a percentage of our compensation in the company, they're not a small amount. But we
expect that to move back in the high 20s. But we have been working on this business to continue to improve the
digitization of the services side of it. So basically, if you think about it, you get $1.00 worth of revenue and you
take about half past the compensation and in the financial advisory grids and the other payouts and then we take
the rest of it and convert it to about a 30% deposit, the other half and convert about 30 percentage points or 60%
of that to profit, pre-tax, this quarter down a little bit because of payroll. So, we feel very good about where we
stand on a relative basis.
But one of the things the team continues to work on across Eric and Lindsay and Katy is to drive operational
excellence to a new level in that business, because we believe that there's still a lot of cost that can come out
around the more simple straightforward products, the delivery of those products, the paper-based usage and
things like that. And then also remember, we are making investments in advisors. We have 4,000 plus trainees in
the businesses across the company, and we believe that the best advisor is one that's grown with our own
company and we continue to do that. And that's a drag on the P&L that we're willing to take to make sure we have
an advisor growth in the future.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, helpful color, Brian. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping either you or Alastair could provide just an
update on expectations around upcoming regulatory development, specifically how your scenario planning for
Basel 4, any expectations around the FDIC special assessment? There were a lot of items that had been floated
just given recent events in the SVB fallout. I was hoping to get some perspective just in terms of regulatory mark-
to-market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think we don't have anything more than you do in a broad sense. But I think, at the end of day I
think this industry has extremely strong capital liquidity and capabilities that we just demonstrated through the
pandemic and then through the aftermath of the pandemic and then through inflation, and then through a
tightening cycle that hasn't happened before. So I feel good about where the industry stands, and I think people
have to step back and think about it overall.
And then frankly, this industry in the United States is so much stronger than Europe. It has so much capital per
square inch, so to speak, than Europe does to get to ratios which on numbers are lower, but the amount of capital
to get there is pretty unbelievable. So we have twice the capital as our European counterparts of similar size and
the ratios are considered to be lower. So, obviously as they pull this together they've got to make sure they aren't
counting the beans different ways with the gold plating and other things in United States. So hopefully, people are
starting to see the wisdom and making sure they're careful here. And we'll see how it play out, but we don't have
any special understanding.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just a quick clarification on the balance sheet, and a separate question. The cash obviously went
up a lot, and you did allude to that, moving some of the securities to cash. But the short-term borrowings was also
up a lot, and I didn't know if that's just to kind of hold more liquidity in the current environment and we should
assume that continues, which I think weighs on NIM but not the NII dollars. Or was that just temporary in 1Q and
we shouldn't pay too much attention to the period-end trend there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's a little bit of both, Matt. You've got, first quarter is just normally a seasonal build for us, so that happens and a
little bit of borrow. And you're right, it doesn't impact NIM, because you can invest in cash straight away and
there's no drag there. But it may hurt [ph] NOI (01:05:45) slightly at the margin by a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Sorry, I think you meant to say, it doesn't hurt the NII dollars that much, but it hurts NIM percent, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. And then separately, any kind of trend to call out in spending in March, some of your peers talked
about a slowdown in March. And you highlighted kind of for the full quarter debit and credit card was up 6% year-
over-year and total payments up 9%. Any kind of intra-quarter trends you want to point to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, we saw in the first part of the quarter, first quarter being a little bit softer and then but saw it kick back up in
March. So far in April, it's still early, it's probably a little lower than it was for the month of March. But it's a couple
weeks in, so we've got to be a little bit careful about that, just due to the different ways vacations fall and things
like that, so. But it's, over the course of last year, the total spending year-over-year increases have slowed down,
and I think that means that's a precursor to the economy being a little bit slower that we're seeing. And then
frankly, consumers being more careful in the use of their cash, because the cash in their accounts, in our
accounts especially for the lower income cohorts continues to build honestly. From peak last April, it fell down a
little bit, all across the year and it's built back up in the first part of this year. So we'll see that play out. There's
been a bit of a delay in some of the tax returns, as you know. This year that pushes them from quarter to quarter.
But stay tuned. I think it's a little early to call, but it is a little softer in the first part of April here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Operator: We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. Wanted to start by the shift to interest bearing from non-interest bearing, I
know you said you expect that to continue. Do you expect the pace of that to slow? Or is it still – it's still running
pretty high or even to accelerate? Any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I'd expect it to slow over time, Vivek. Because we're getting pretty close now to Q4 2019 levels anyway
which was the last peak. And also, you think about the big driver, it tends to be Global Banking. And as rates are
rising, clients are doing their rotation. But we're getting towards the end of the hikes now, we would think. So
you'd anticipate there'd be a little bit of a lag there. But generally speaking, I'd expect it to slow at some point, and
I think we're probably getting close now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
One more, Alastair. Office CRE, you gave the geographical mix in your slides for the total CRE portfolio. Can you
give us some similar thing for the office CRE portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I can do, but I'm going to need to follow-up with you afterwards, because I don't have it at hand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
But I don't think you're going to find anything there other than sort of typical geographic distribution similar to the
way we serve our customers around the United States.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Alastair, can you elaborate a little further, you talked about, I think it's slide 12, you show us the 100 basis point
parallel shift impacts in net interest income by a positive $3.3 billion over the following 12 months. If the rate
environment does shift and maybe we do start to see lower rates by the end of the year, how quickly can you
guys move this from being asset sensitive to neutral or liability sensitive on the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think if you were to take that same metric on the downside, it would be probably be down $3.6 billion for
down a 100, just to give you some idea. And what's happening now is obviously, as the interest-bearing piece just
continues to rise across the company, we've got a hedge now as rates – if and when they start to go back down. It
won't be a complete hedge, but it will be a little bit of a hedge there. Then you also get something back in terms of
Global Markets NII. That will start bleeding back positively. So there's some puts and some takes, but we'll see
how that develops over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, in the Global Banking slide, you guys give us slide 22, you had a
negative provision in this quarter and you referenced that it's an improved macroeconomic outlook. Can you give
us some color what you're seeing there to give you confidence to have a negative provision? And then the
second, does this also include the recent Shared National Credit Exam results in this line item as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It would always include those results that's come through continuously. There's not – there's change over time.
That's a continuous set of things they look at and we always do well in that. And when we say macro
environment, remember that this business set is credit across the world, so there's places that we finished up on –
cleaning up, that allowed us to lease some reserves on one side. And then we had other places that we would
have put up reserves. But at the end of the day, the overall credit quality here is very strong and very stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, I think there's a couple things going on. Number one, we didn't have any real loan
growth. Number two, the asset quality remains terrific. Number three, the macro environment when you look at
the Blue Chip Consensus was ever so slightly better. So we felt we were pretty well-provided for already. And
then on the Commercial side, we had a little bit of exposure runoff in one or two places where we may have been
reserved quite conservatively. So it was all those things added together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Actually, Brian and Alastair, you guys obviously have been through a few cycles. Why is Commercial so
strong? I'm just – you and your peers all have good Commercial credit quality, any suggestions of what you're
seeing that makes it so good?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, their profitability remains in a good place. Cash flows remain in a good place. I think corporate America
learned something from 2009 and 2008, and so leverage is in a good place. You add all that up, you've got a
decent environment overall for the economy and that's where we are with respect to credit quality. So, we'll have
to watch that over time, but as of right now, it's in terrific shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you very much.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two questions. One, just keying off of the loan discussion just now, could you give us a sense of how you're
thinking about lending standards and any changes in a post-SVB environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, look, we don't really have a significant change to our risk appetite. We haven't changed our client selection.
Those are largely speaking designed to be through the cycle. We will obviously adjust on specific concerns about
asset quality performance in a sector or outlook. But I'd say with respect to our loan growth, where we're seeing it
23


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
more is, as the Fed raises rates, those rates are changing our customer demand. So, we just don't see as much
demand right now for securities-based lending or mortgage. But it's less about credit tightening or standards. It's
more about just Fed doing and having the effect that you would expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then two other quickies. One on the Consumer checking account balances in March, was that uptick in
part a function of seasonality and end of period, end of pay cycle type of behavior? Or is there something more
going on there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think, as always, that's a cohort of pre-pandemic compared to where they were then and now. And they
had been sort of bouncing around that level for the last six months and they moved up a little bit. This is the time
of the year they do move up, because of tax returns and other things and year-end payments and stuff. But they
clearly aren't going – they basically are stable from November, December, January. They start increasing in
February, and then they bounced up little bit. So, we'll see where it ends up. What the clear message is, despite
people having said these consumers are spending down their money, it would be out of these balances in mid-
2022 or the third quarter, they clearly are still sitting with a fair amount of money in their account relative to pre-
pandemic times.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just lastly, AI has been a big topic recently, as I'm sure you know. You've got Erica, just
wondering about plans to leverage AI. Maybe you're going to be leveraging Erica and that maybe it's a different
kind of strategy, but the thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, Erica, obviously the basic concept was built for us a number of years – four, five, six, seven years ago
starting and came into the business. It is a predictive language type of program, where you put a question in and
it answers it, but we had to do a special language to make sure it would work with our business, it wasn't a
general. So we did that. Then that then put us in a condition to start to deploy it to our customers, because it's
captive to our data. In other words, it's looking at our systems, finding information and give it to clients is really a
service capability. And look, so what we've seen is that that increase is a clear indicator of how valuable these
types of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, predictive technologies can be for customer service
and things like that. We've also taken Erica internally and applied it to help us do work and we've seen it have
those benefits. Ultimately, we think this has extreme benefits for our company. We think it has a lot – and you've
seen this this written about in the computer coding areas. In other words it can speed up the process of what used
to be called object programming. That goes on. We think it has a lot to do in terms of allowing teammates to work
much more quickly and efficiently with our systems and get information out and can make even someone like me
the ability to do analytics that I have to send to somebody to have them put – key it into the system. So there's a
lot of value to this.
The key question will be, when can you use it without the fear of – the reason why a lot of us stopped it in our
industry and other industries was it wasn't clear how it worked with your data and the outside world's data, and
how it would interact to pull stuff out and we have to be careful of that. And then secondly, we have to understand
24


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
how the decisions are made to be able to stand up to our customers' demands for us to be fair and frankly follow
the laws and rules and regulations on lending.
So I think all that is good, strong, it's really an important thing. So we're not a neophyte in that sense, actually
operating out that we understand the value of it. But we will carefully apply it and we see a great value. I don't
think it's great value in the next month, but in the overall sense it will help us manage the head count down, which
we've been doing this quarter. And remember, we started this company, the management team started with this
company in 2010 with 285,000 and 300,000 people working here, and we're running the same sized company
with 216,000 people, a bigger company, doing more stuff. And so all that's been aided by digitization, of which this
is a potential step function change.

Thanks, so much. Appreciate it.

Operator: We'll take our final question at this time. This is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please
go ahead, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. In terms of your guidance for lower expenses in the second quarter, than the third quarter, than the fourth
quarter, how much of that is expectations for slower business activity and how much of that is due to expected
scale benefits from technology? And I guess the bigger question too is, are you seeing evidence of a banking
crisis? Are you seeing evidence of a banking recession? And is that part of the reason for the expense guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
No, it's not. Mike, I would say, there could be the activity, in the first quarter it was actually higher in some ways,
because of volatility on the trading side and things like that. So we're expecting to get scale and operating
leverage across activity, taking less dollars to do it, in the OpEx and the work we do. We build up more people
largely because not the fear of last year or the turnover rate that has now gone in half in a year, and requires to
be hiring a lot to stay ahead of it. And then, when it slow down we build up people and we're bringing it back down
the line. But there is no – the expenses frankly are just managing that account carefully, because that's two-thirds
expense based and getting more leverage out of the activities. But there's no – we'll have more checking
accounts, we'll have more credit card accounts. We'll do more wires on a given day. We'll do more trades on a
given day. And that can ebb and flow, but overall, we're expecting activity to continue to rise. Now, will loan
demand, i.e., people want to borrow another $10 versus the $10 they had, that's what we say slows down. But
that's not that they don't have a loan, its that they borrow different amounts of money.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. So this is just really managing the business, not your reduced investment spend, or anything like that?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
No. And on the investment spend, we're spending – we increased this year versus last year, $300 million to $400
million in pure initiative spending, and that's going through the run rate as we speak. And we wouldn't cut that
because we think to the point of Betsy's comment, it gives us a chance to continue to leverage the franchise and
nowhere is that more evident than in our Consumer business, where the number of branches year-over-year are
down, a few hundred again. Customers are bigger and more stuffs going through. Customer delight is at an all-
time high. Attrition is at an all-time low, and that's what makes that franchise valuable as you well know. And that's
why continuing to invest in new capabilities all the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And last thing, big picture for you, Brian, just the evidence that a recession is coming and the impact on you guys,
where are you right now? Is it red? Is it flashing yellow? Is it green? How has it moved? Just what's the
temperature?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Candace and the research teams have been consistent to see after the Fed raises rates [ph] as announced
(01:21:32), there would be a recession, they have a mild recession. And that they predicted basically say, 0.5% to
1% negative – annualized negative GDP growth Q3, Q4, and Q1 and then back to positive. So I think at the end
of the day, we don't see the activity on the Consumer side slowing at a pace that would indicate that, but we
would see Commercial customers are being more careful and things like that. But everything points to relatively
mild recession, given the amount of stimulus that was paid to people and the money they have left over, the fact
that unemployment is still at 3.5%, this [ph] full (01:22:12) employment plus. And then the wage growth is slowing
and tipping over. So the signs of inflation tipping down, but they're still there but that translates into relatively good
activity. So we see as a slight recession, and we'll see what happens. But we built this company across the last
decade even in the stress scenarios that you see somewhere in the slides, last quarter we didn't reproduce them
because they've the same answer. Our stress scenarios are always less than anybody else's, because of how we
built the company through – to go through recessions without problem, including the pandemic.

Thank you for your time. And I want to thank my teammates for a great performance, again this first quarter of
2023, a strong quarter of 18% year-over-year EPS growth. The strength, stability and being there for our
customers continued to show through, including strong capital of 11.4%, liquidity at $900 billion, and GLS. But the
most important thing and we just touched on it was really two things, continued organic growth in our franchise
and operating leverage by growing revenue faster than expenses. So we feel good about that and look forward to
talking to you next quarter.
