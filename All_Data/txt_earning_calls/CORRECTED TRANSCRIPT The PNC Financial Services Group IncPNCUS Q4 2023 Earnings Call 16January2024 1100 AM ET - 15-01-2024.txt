William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. During a challenging and volatile operating environment for the
banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full
year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment and expenses related to a staff
reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to
$13.85 per diluted share in 2022.
Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen
relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core
expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage. For the fourth
quarter, we reported $883 million in net income, or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted
basis. Rob's going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points.
First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from
Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from
non-interest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees.
Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce, and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense
savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes.
Expense discipline remains a top priority for us; and accordingly, we are targeting stable expenses for 2024 even
as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives.
Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to growing our
balance sheet. While we continue to expect credit charge-offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office
segment, we're adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw
solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value, and repurchased a modest amount of shares.

In summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through-the-cycle performance and feel very good
about our strategy, our capabilities, and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024; and we believe we
are well-positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond.
As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make
our success possible.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 3 and is presented on an average basis
and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and averaged $325 billion, which include the acquired
Signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion, or 2%. Cash balances at the
Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion, and deposits increased $1.4 billion and averaged $424 billion.
Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion, driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior
debt issuances. At year-end, PNC was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long-term debt
requirements, and we expect to reach compliance with the bank-level metrics through our normal course of
funding, well in advance of the phase-in period.
AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter-end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable
interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common
share, up 9% linked-quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago.
We remain well-capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31, which increased 10 basis
points linked-quarter. Our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed
capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year-end, which is well-above our current requirement of 7%.
We continue to be well-positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share
repurchase activity of approximately $100 million, or roughly 0.5 million shares. And when combined with $600
million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders.
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2%,
driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion,
an increase of $5 billion, driven by the acquisition of the Signature capital commitment portfolio.
Excluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the Signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined
$3 billion, or 1%, driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand. Consumer loans grew approximately $130
million, driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card
balances. And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter.
Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter, as
seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix,
consolidated non-interest-bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third
quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect the non-interest-bearing portion of our
deposits to stabilize near current levels.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Our current rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in
the prior quarter. As of December 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for
the quarter. As we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher while interest rates remain at
current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point we believe the
rate paid on deposits will begin to decline.
Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion
decreased 2%, as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The
securities portfolio yield increased 2 basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of
December 31, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years.
Our receive-fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31. The weighted
average receive-fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 3 basis points to 2.1%, and the duration of the portfolio
was 2.3 years. AOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as
lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value
from AOCI accretion.
Turning to the income statement on slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million, or $1.85 per share,
which included pre-tax non-core expenses of $665 million, or $525 million after-tax, related to the FDIC special
assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding non-core expenses,
adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased to $128 million, or 2%, compared to the third
quarter of 2023.
Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of 5 basis
points. Non-interest income increased $143 million, or 8%. Non-interest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829
million, or 26%, and included $665 million of non-core expenses. Core non-interest expense was $3.4 billion and
increased $164 million, or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was
16.3%.
Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core non-interest expense was well controlled and grew 1%.
Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive
operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis.
Turning to slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million, or 2%, compared
with the third quarter driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee
income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million, or 6% linked-quarter.
Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million, or
84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset management and brokerage revenue grew $12 million, or 3%,
reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million, or
26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights.
Other non-interest income of $138 million increased $44 million, or 47%, and included favorable valuation
adjustments and gains on sales. The fourth quarter also included $100 million negative Visa fair value adjustment
compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31, PNC owned
3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Turning to slide 9, our fourth quarter non-interest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665
million of non-core charges. Core non-interest expense of $3.4 billion increased $164 million, or 5% linked-
quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality, and asset impairments. During the quarter, we incurred
$42 million of impairment charges, which were largely related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced
our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet, or approximately 17%.
For the full year, core non-interest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million, or 1%. Expense growth was
well controlled due in part to the $50 million mid-year increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we
exceeded. As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year.
Looking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our
ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce
reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024. Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of
expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, we
did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Non-performing loans increased $57 million, or 3% linked-
quarter, and included a $12 million increase in CRE. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million, or
8% linked-quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have
already been resolved.
Net loan charge-offs were $200 million in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our
annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled
$5.5 billion, or 1.7% of total loans on December 31, stable with September 30.
The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress, and fourth quarter net loan charge-offs were
$56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe, we've adequately
reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total
office loans; and inside of that, 12.9% on the multi-tenant portfolio.
Importantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked-quarter, reflecting a
higher level of payoffs. Criticized office loans were flat, and non-performing loans increased 2% linked-quarter.
Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions,
and a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides.
In summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter and full-year 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy,
we're expecting a mild recession starting in mid-2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect
the Federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024, when we expect the
Fed to begin to cut rates. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points in 2024, with a 25-basis-point decrease in
July, November and December.
Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2024 compared to 2023 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth
of 3% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%.
Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and non-interest
income to be up 4% to 6%; core non-interest expenses to be stable; and we expect our effective tax rate to be
approximately 18.5%.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average
loans to be stable; net interest income to be down 2% to 3%; fee income to be down 6% to 8% due to seasonally
lower first quarter client activity, as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels; other non-
interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity.
Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 3% to 4%. We expect total
core non-interest expense to be down 3% to 4%. We expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $200
million and $250 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous
Research. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning. Wanted to ask, Rob and Bill, about the loan growth outlook for 2024. The spot guidance of up 3%
to 4% seems a bit better than what we're seeing in H8 currently. I thought you could give some color on the
drivers of your outlook there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. Hey, John. Good morning. It's Rob. Yeah, on the outlook, so average loans, up 1%; spot, 3% to 4%, as you
mentioned. We see most of that being on the commercial side and most of that being on the back end of the year.
Consumer, we do have some growth throughout the year, but pretty modest.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And Rob, on the net interest income guidance, sounds like you're assuming three rate cuts, a little bit less
than what the forward curve has. Just kind of wondering what would be the sensitivity if the forward curve played
out and we saw more rate cuts than what you're assuming. Is that helpful to the NII outlook, all else equal, or
relatively neutral? Could you update us on the sensitivity there, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure, John. Yeah, the short answer is it's relatively neutral because, as you know, we've worked hard to get our
balance sheet into a neutral sensitivity position. So not a lot of variance in terms of the forwards and our own
expectations in terms of the impact on NII. The big question, obviously, is going to be on deposit pricing and how
that behaves as the year plays out, but we don't expect a lot of variance.

Operator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the capital markets revenue, the numbers certainly came in really solid this quarter. As you
look into 2024 and in the context of your up 4% to 6% non-interest income guidance for the full year, how are you
thinking about capital markets trajectory through the year off of this level? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, John. Good morning. Yeah, so with capital markets, we did get the rebound that we were expecting in
the fourth quarter, and the bulk of that is in our Harris Williams, our M&A advisory business. As far as 2024
guidance goes, the pipelines are good. We expect sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2023 to be the
range of what we would see on a quarterly basis going through in 2024. The anomalies were the soft quarters of
Q2 and Q3 in 2023. So take a look at the first quarter of 2023, the fourth quarter of 2023, and that's the range of
what we would expect the quarterly run rate to be through 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right, Rob, thanks for that. And then, separately...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'll even help you there, John. It's up about 20% year-over-year. I'll save you the math there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Yeah. All right. Thanks for that. And then, your guidance for 2024 implies about 100 basis points negative
operating leverage using the midpoint of the guidance, which actually screens relatively well versus your peers.
How sustainable is that if the rate environment does not pan out as you're modeling and – or better put, if your
revenue outlook is worse? Do you think you can sustain at that expected negative 100 basis points operating
leverage or could it be worse? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, we're fairly neutral for our NII forecast toward – as a function of rate cuts or not. So the outcome ought to be
the same.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Yeah. Well, I would add to that, John. So we worked hard. We took some actions to position ourselves to have
stable expenses year-over-year. So that's a lot. And then as Bill pointed out on the revenue side, the NII is fairly
predictable on a relative basis outside of rates and then the fees. We feel good about the guidance. So, that's
what we think is going to occur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think if there's variance anywhere, it's going to be on our assumptions as it relates to deposit betas, the
continued shift to interest-bearing versus non-interest-bearing; and, ultimately, the steepness of the yield curve,
the rates at the long end of the curve as opposed to the front end of the curve. We've tried to be, to the best of our
ability, a little bit on the conservative side of all of those things. And we feel pretty good about where our forecast
is.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to share just some
updated thoughts on sort of where and when NII might bottom; and I think perhaps more importantly, magnitude
of rebound that we might see thereafter. I know you sort of suggested last month that NII ultimately could be a
record in 2025. I guess I'd be curious for any updated context around your thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Scott. Good morning. Yeah, so as we pointed out, we do see NII going down in the first half of the
year, troughing around the time of the cuts, and then growing from there and beyond. So, think about where we
are now, go down a bit, and then grow back to where we are now. And then in 2025 what gives us a lot of
confidence around record NII is we will get the compounded effect of the repricing of our fixed rate assets as that
continues into 2025. So, that's what we laid out a month ago and that's still what we think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just on the notion of deposit pricing. It sounds like you're expecting
deposit cost to ease right around the time the Fed starts cutting. What's your sense for, sort of, the pace of
deposit betas on the way down vis-à-vis what they were on the way up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, I would say on the commercial and the high net-worth side, fast. And then we talked about on the consumer,
sort of the core consumer, we could – and this is what Bill was alluding to there earlier, we could continue to see
some drift up in rate paid even though we get some cuts. So, that's a big variable obviously, and we'll have to play
it out.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for outlining the macro assumptions behind the outlook, and appreciate your
comments on loan growth being more back-end loaded. But can you give us some more color on how you're
thinking about it? Because you also mentioned a mild recession mid-year. So, is it really a big uptick in C&I in
maybe like 4Q as rates begin to come down and as we come out of that mild recession? So, I was hoping you
could give us some more color on both commercial and consumer there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, I would just say just to follow up on that. So, yeah, back half of the year, on the commercial side, we see the
uptick in the third and the fourth quarter. A big part of that being expected increase in utilization, which is a little bit
lower right now and then just some pick-up in general economic activity. Not a lot, 3% to 4% spot to average up
1%. And then on the consumer, just sort of slow, steady growth. Nothing big there, maybe a little bit more in card
and auto, and a little bit less in resi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just on the credit side, last quarter you had some CRE loans move from criticized into NPLs, and
it looks like things have been pretty steady this quarter on both criticized and NPLs. So, do you think at this stage,
you guys have scrubbed the books and it should remain steady over the next few quarters with just NCOs ticking
up or is it likely to be lumpy? The question is more, given the new outlook for rates to come down, do you think
the worst is behind us?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, not on charge-offs. We think we're reserved correctly, but you have to remember that as these loans go to
NPL and, eventually, if we have charges against them, we'll charge them off. It won't run through P&L because
we've already created a reserve for it. But the work's set on actually maturing the loans and dealing with the
outcome is yet to come.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, and I would just add to that. The key number to look at there is the criticized percentage, which has not
changed much. To Bill's point, that's the first bucket. The movement of that to non-performing or charge-offs will
occur, but it's that criticized number that's the key number.

Hey, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys share with us – you talked, Rob, about the commercial loan growth in the quarter; when you ex out
the Signature purchase was down slightly. I know you have prospects for growth here in 2024, as you pointed out.
But can you share with us, do you guys see much competition from the private credit market, the private equity
guys that have been much more aggressive recently in lending? And second and part of that, you have them as
customers as well, so do you have to balance them as competitors as well as customers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We don't compete with them head-to-head with the types of loans they're typically in because we don't play that
much in the unsecured leverage space. Most of the decline at Signature we saw was in utilization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And some seasonality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. As we go forward, more and more of the lending markets are moving into private hands and longer-term
that is of a concern if they kind of move up scale in what they do. We do serve them. I would say that our client
base with just, call it, private equity or private managers at large, they're probably our largest clients between what
we do with and for them from Harris Williams and Solebury and business credit and treasury management with
their portfolio companies and on and on and on. So, they are good clients; and I guess at the margin, we could
end up competing with them in certain things.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I see. Okay. Thank you. And then, Rob, the follow-up with your comments you gave us the Visa ownership and
the unrealized gain. If I recall correctly, I think first quarter of 2024 the owners of those shares are permitted to
monetize that. Can you give us your updated thoughts on what you guys are thinking with your position in Visa?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure, Gerard. So our position is we have $1.5 billion in unrealized gains, 3.5 million B shares. As you
pointed out, there's a vote by the Visa shareholders at the end of this month to approve an action to enable the B
holders to monetize maybe up to 50%. So we don't control that. We see when the vote is scheduled, should it be
approved, then we'll move forward with our monetization plans that would be allowed under whatever is approved.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on credit, if we play out what the soft landing scenario could
look like and the Fed starts cutting rates in mid-2024, would you expect to be in a position to possibly start
releasing reserves; or are the – there's sort of likely to still be late-cycle concerns that would lead you to want to
maintain the reserve levels that you've already established?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hi, Bill. It's Rob. So, first, our reserves are appropriate for what we expect to occur. So, that's number one.
Number two, if things should substantially improve, yes, sure. We're running at 1.7% right now, which historically
is on the high side. So if things normalize out and your definition of normal, we could be lower.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And then, Bill, following up on your comment about feeling good about your reserve levels, but that we
haven't necessarily seen peak charge-off rates yet. If we were to go down the mild recession scenario path,
should we expect there to be some lag between when those charge-offs would actually hit the P&L and when the
corresponding reserves would get released; or would the releases kind of occur concurrent with the increase in
charge-offs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, remember, the charge-offs don't hit P&L. There seems to be a lot of confusion on that. The provisions we take
hit P&L, and we've provided for our best expectation of future charge-offs in a scenario that assumes a mild
12

recession. So if our scenario comes true, we're fully reserved for everything that might happen to us. Charge-offs
will flow through, but not hit our P&L because they're effectively neutralized against the debit to the provision.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

William Stanton Demchak A

There always seems to be some confusion on that, but does that make sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. No, I understand. I guess where I was going with that is that some have sort of alluded to allowing – if the
credit environment does indeed deteriorate, allowing some of those losses to flow through without necessarily
releasing reserves. And so, even though they've established reserves, they would kind of maintain those reserves
and allow the higher charge-offs to flow through before ultimately releasing. And I was just hoping to get your
thoughts on kind of the timing of those different pieces.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, it's a mechanical calculation that's dependent on our view of the economy at the time. So, if you got to a place
where the charge-offs occur and somehow we thought the economy was worse than our current expectation, we
would be providing for the remainder of the portfolio at a higher level than we are today, right. But right now, we
don't expect that to happen. So if the economy is worse – simply put, if the economy is worse than a mild
recession, then you would expect our total reserve to increase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. If I could squeeze in one last one on capital return. I appreciate slide 19. Can you speak to how
you're thinking about that 150-basis-point impact from Basel III endgame in light of some of the pushback that it's
received. And is that 8.2% a level you feel comfortable running at; or would you target a slightly higher buffer?
And then, sort of underlying all of that, how are you thinking about buybacks in light of all the moving pieces?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We'll answer the easy question first. 8.2% would be too low, I think, in this new environment, assuming Basel III
endgame goes through. So we'd run at some higher number than that for certain. There does appear to be
substantial commentary on the proposal, such that I would expect that if it isn't re-proposed, there still would be
some relief in certain asset categories and risk-weighted assets and maybe on operating risk capital. We'll see.
Having said that, we don't know. So at the moment, what we know is we're going to continue to grow earnings,
we're going to accrete AOCI back into our capital base, and we're going to pull that 8.2% up. We think we have
flexibility inside of that to be active in the share repurchase market between now and then. And the more certainty
we have, the more certain we'll be and explicit on what we might buy back during a given period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And I would just add to that. You saw we bought just under $100 million of – sorry, share repurchases in the
fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we would expect to do at least that, maybe a little bit more, depending on
market conditions.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask one follow-up question on NII, if I may. A lot of investors were really
excited about the graphic that you put together at Goldman, the Nike swoosh, if you will, that had sort of the first
rate cut embedded under the Nike swoosh 25 basis points in 3Q 2024. And I completely understand this is
abstract in a way. But I just wanted to put together everything that you guys said.
I think it surprises investors that when you overlay the forward curve that it is neutral to this outcome, at least for
2024. But just looking back at the slides, Rob, and slide 6 of this earnings season, it does seem like a lot of your
receive-fixed swaps don't really meaningfully mature until 4Q 2024.
So I guess, in terms of like the mechanical repricing that you keep talking about, the way to really ask this
question is, it sounds like it is possible to have potentially a lower trough than people expected in 2024 and still
have that record net interest income in 2025 because of those fixed rate dynamics. And who knows what can
14


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
(PNC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
happen on the liability side and the deposit repricing side if the Fed cuts sooner. But it feels like that swap
maturity is part of why that Nike swoosh could be deeper. Am I thinking about it the right way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't know that we expect it to be deeper. We purposely drew the line to be a little bit thick, because we don't
know exactly when that trough might occur. I think all of the commentary on 2025 is, in some ways, mechanical.
It's simply taking our fixed rate assets and repricing them at market, and we know what the maturities of those
assets are.
So in short form, one of the reasons we highlight that and also show the steepness of the curve is our balance
sheet – the fixed rate assets on our balance sheet are shorter than virtually all of our peers, and at a yield level
that is somewhat lower. So we have a big pick-up in fixed rate earning yields sooner than I think the market
expects, which is, in turn, what gives rise to the slope of that curve. Whether it troughs in the second quarter or
the first week in the third quarter or the fourth week, who knows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But still we're confident that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I don't think it's the perfect timing, though, that investors are worried about in terms of second quarter and third
quarter. It's just that your new guidance would imply, sort of, after the first quarter that your average NII would be
like 3%, 3.7% or something like that, right? So to get to a record net interest income, it would have to be a pretty
significant progression from there. So that's sort of – I'm trying to set the stage for you guys to build that bridge
because I think that investors really believe that you can reach that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Got it. Second question, just on the fee outlook. Good to see, first of all, in the fourth
quarter, the capital markets improvement that you saw. Just wondering how much of a driver is that of your

to see growth in this year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Ken. As I said earlier, on the capital markets, a nice rebound in our Harris Williams activity. Pipelines
are good. They support year-over-year growth of close to 20%, which is what I mentioned earlier. In terms of the
other fee categories, asset management, flattish, up a bit. That will be market-dependent. Card and cash
management, up low to mid-single digits.
Lending and deposit services, that will be down mid-single digits, and that's reflective of anticipated lower service
charges on deposits. There was a number of items that we did in 2023 to reduce overdraft charges for our clients.
So that's good for our clients, but that will be some lower fees, about mid-single digit down. And then mortgage
outside of hedge gains, flattish; down if you include the hedge gains.

Hey, Bill. December 5, your ardent words, I quote, skill matters today more than it ever has prior to March and the

better scale when you get positive operating leverage in 2024 with a chance you could do that, but I think you're
talking further out. I think you're talking about organic and maybe inorganic expansion. But help me out there, if

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, I was. Look, if you just look back at what happened this year on top of kind of eight or nine years of
history post the Financial Crisis. We've seen, your words, Goliath win in terms of organic deposit share growth.
That trend line has accelerated as a function of the mini crisis in March, where corporates bluntly don't necessarily
trust the regulatory environment to ensure that their deposits at a bank are safe. And so, we've seen those
deposits flow uphill. And if you aren't a primary relationship with that corporate, deeply embedded with treasury
management and other services, you net-net lose corporate deposits.
I think when you combine that with the cost of technology, the removal of some of the tiering and regulation and
capital requirements and liquidity, scale matters. I think we are – on net, benefited from the mini crisis, but just
barely. And I think below us, people struggle with that conversation with corporate clients. Above us, perhaps it's
easy. But I think we need to move into that next level such that we are seen coast-to-coast is a ubiquitous
standard brand, with the quasi support that the giant banks have in terms of times of crisis. I think it's critical.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I know you're always of... yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So naturally, over time, we are gaining share on our newer markets at a rapid pace. And we see that client
acquisition and growth in all forms from deposits to loans to fees to so forth. I think through time, you're going to
see a clear differentiation of this dynamic played out across the market.
I think there's going to be banks that are looking for strong partners, and I think we are a strong partner. I'm not
going to force that issue. But I think longer-term, we are a natural player in the consolidation of an industry where
scale matters.

You just have to execute. I mean, there's a – which simplifies the process. If you think about what's happening in
the banking industry today, there's a couple – ignore some other issues with the large banks, but on the deposit
share side, there's a couple of clear winners. There's one that probably should be over time. There's some people
neutral and there's people losing. There's 5,000 banks in the country that I can take from and grow, right. That's

think we'll have to chase them. One of the reasons – people say, why am I as vocal about this as I am. And part
of the reason is to make the public aware, the public being regulators, politicians, boards of other banks, aware of
what's happening in the banking industry and the need for consolidation. Doesn't mean I'm going to do something
stupid in the pursuit of it. I just think it's going to happen.

I don't think there's a simple answer to that, because I think if you listen carefully to the various speeches that
have been done, they'll talk about the recognition of the need for M&A; but they'll also talk about good mergers
and bad mergers, good outcomes and bad outcomes along several metrics. So, put differently, I think certain
deals will get approved and others wouldn't. I think we have proven, as an acquirer, that we know what we're
doing and that the resulting institution is in fact stronger than the one we might acquire.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And I guess just taking a step back around your view around the mild recession, I'm just wondering
how much of that is just theoretical, informing your reserving model, versus the weakness that you're seeing
across your customers and that leads you to believe that we will have a recession in the middle of the year.
Because once we go down that path, who knows how bad things could get. So, just would love to hear whether
the recession assumption is just your conservatism; or are you seeing weakness across your customers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, you see the credit metrics. It's not a concern in terms of customers. We've seen with the margin, profit
margins decrease with certain clients. If you look at soft inputs, surveys, and so forth that are coming out of the
Fed districts, the economy is definitely weakening, not at a alarming pace. It's kind of what we had expected given
how tight the Fed has gotten with monetary policy.
So we kind of see a mild recession. We actually see employment remaining strong through that, which ultimately
is the thing that keeps the economy from going deeply into recession, just the strength of the labor market and
consumer spending. So, this is kind of following the path of what we thought for some period of time now.

I was just going to add to that to Bill's. I mean, we can have a slowdown continue and technically hit a recession
without adding a whole lot of credit risk or increased credit structure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just one thing, Rob, you mentioned that you expect non-interest-bearing deposits to stabilize
from here. Just playing devil's advocate, why should they stabilize from here? If rates remain, if we're in a 3%-plus
Fed funds world, should we not expect the mix of deposits to move towards interest-bearing, towards more CDs;
or is your view different?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, I think, obviously, we've been watching that for the better part of the year here in terms of the decline in non-
interest-bearing in absolute terms and relative percentages. Why we think it's largely happened is because it's
been so long. And much of that base is businesses and individuals that run on non-interest-bearing deposits. So,
they're not necessarily shopping for a higher rate. There's something around the institution in terms of they pay for
their services, through deposits; or on the consumer side, small transaction accounts.

You obviously gave details for this year. But as you think out, like, the next couple of years, are you in the camp

I mean, I don't think there's going to be any structural delevering here. We're obviously seeing a lot of banks, kind
of on my prior point, coming to the conclusion that some of the ancillary lending activities they took on, on the
back of the big stimulus, don't make sense anymore. So there's deleveraging maybe across the industry by
certain groups, but not here.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And I guess I meant from customers, right. Look, even if rates go down a little bit, they're still structurally a lot
higher than they've been for last almost 15 years. So, if you just think about like the lending demand that's out
there, obviously there's lots of factors, but just thoughts on if higher rate structurally have a meaningful impact on
that. Thank you.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sorry, on loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Correct. Right, as you think about corporate borrowers, right, they just can't afford potentially to borrow as much
with rates higher. Obviously, the same for consumer mortgage is the most obvious. So, thinking more like on the
commercial side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, I think at the end of the day, our generic corporate client needs to redo their facilities and the price has gone
up, and that will occur. I think some of the activity that we saw on the back of just really low cost of capital in the
private equity markets where kind of leverage is free, that's going to go by the wayside at a higher rate
environment. But if you look at the composition of our book, we're kind of the bread and butter of America. So, I
wouldn't expect that we would necessarily see a decline in loan growth simply because the front-end of – SOFR
rate is higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Just back on the M&A discussion. I know you mentioned building in a bigger buffer
than that 8.2% you have on your adjusted CET1 ratio today. But is the plan to also maybe retain more capital than
you normally would to better position you for taking advantage of any inorganic opportunities, which might keep
the buyback activity more muted this year? Just curious to get your thoughts there, how you might balance that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, there – I mean both of those thoughts are consistent. 8.2% is too low, so we're going to grow. Whether
we're growing to be in faster compliance or growing because maybe something shows up where we could use
some, we're still going to grow, and it's going to mute our capital return below it, it otherwise might be, absent the
Basel III endgame changes.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. So you would expect buyback activity maybe to remain muted for the rest of the year, not just the first
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There's too much up in the air. I mean, it's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...depending what the Fed does, look, they could have to re-propose that. It could go through the elections. They
could change it materially. We don't know, right? All we know is, all else equal, 8.2% is probably too low. We're
still burning through our AOCI. We don't think that's going to change. So stay the course, and we'll adapt based
on what we learn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then, back on your deposit betas you're assuming in the guide, are you thinking you can move those
commercial rates down materially more, like, right out of the gate with the first cut? Or are you baking in some sort
of a lag at least for the first couple cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It'd be pretty fast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. Great. All right. Thanks, guys.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Do we have any more calls?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We do have a question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Just a follow-up on your commercial loan growth. Like, why you're punching your weight in the growth rate,
and which areas of commercial loan growth? And I know you've deployed teams to all these cities near the
Nashville Main Street Bank and you're trying to gain share and all that. Is it that effort, the market share by city? Is
it kind of smaller middle market? Is it that effect you talked about, scale versus the smaller competitors? I mean,
how much we put in each bucket as far as your delta versus peer when it comes to commercial loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, I would tell you that we're winning more than we're losing on pitches, and that's more true today than it was
pre-March. We're winning at a higher percentage just because there's more shots on goal in the new markets
than we are in the old markets. So the growth there is higher and those new markets and the fact that we have
them fully staffed, including products, Mike, differentiates us in a world where total loan growth may be somewhat
tepid.
And importantly, we believe we've said this for years as we go into new markets, we are not leading with credit in
these new markets. Fee-based growth actually outpaces our loan-based growth in those markets as we cross-sell
into TM and other products and services. So we look at pipelines, we look at line of sight into what we have in
each market. I don't know that there's any particular product that stands out as something that's growing faster
than another one. It's just we're winning clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Last follow-up. How much faster would your commercial loan growth be if there were no private capital
competitors right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think the only way that impacts us directly, I mean, that the margin, maybe something in business credit. And as
you know, we partner with a lot of the private credit guys inside of that business. And then, to the extent
companies are taken private, which I think is going to slow down, given the cost of capital, we sometimes will lose
a client to a leverage lender because they were taken private. But that's kind of...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
At a structure [ph] we would want (01:02:15) financing, right?

But we'd want them, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That would be the margin. Because if that wasn't available, that would otherwise be a conventional loan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.

Operator: And we have a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sorry about that. I don't know what happened there. But Bill, a question for you. Your deposits at the Fed keep
growing. At what point are you thinking about putting some of that or locking some of the yields on that? What's
your thinking there, especially given all your other commentary about rates peaking, mild recession, loan growth,
et cetera, triangulating all of those factors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, in the near-term, we think the market's gotten ahead of itself. I think until we're clear of the outcome here or
clear inflation and Fed actions, we're happy to kind of stay neutral. I think my own expectation here, Vivek, is
notwithstanding what the Fed does through the course of 2024 with the Fed funds rate; my expectation is you're
not going to see a lot of action in the longer rate simply because of the supply calendar and the fact that inflation
will have a tail. And while the Fed could ease somewhat, I think inflation is still going to be running against –
versus their goal. We'll have a lot of issues.
So long story short, we don't see a burning desire to put money to work here, because we think that opportunity is
going to remain in the durations we typically invest in, and probably get a little bit better just given how hot the
market got post the last Fed meeting.

Thanks. And second one, you talked about a lot of companies going into private hands and obviously that
creating competition from private credit for loans. But on the other hand, you've got increasing capital
requirements, which is translating into higher spreads so as to maintain returns. How do you balance that out, on
the one hand, not losing share to the private market; and on the other hand, maintaining that? Given that, do you
see spreads staying high; or do you think that turns – course the other way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, again, we're kind of talking about two different universes of credit. But having said that, I'm sure you've heard
this inside of your own shop. Lending money for the sake of lending money doesn't give us an adequate return on
capital. Didn't before; it doesn't now. What gives us a return on capital is the relationship, the annuity-like fees you
get from TM, the additive fees you get from capital markets-related activity, and price is kind of a third order effect
on the return on capital we get with that client relationship.
Private credit at the moment sees a return in private credit, because they could put some leverage on it and
there's not a big opportunity in private equity and yields are high; and they'll chase that for a period of time. I don't
know that, that's a particularly great investment through the cycle, and we don't try to compete with it in that
lending environment.
