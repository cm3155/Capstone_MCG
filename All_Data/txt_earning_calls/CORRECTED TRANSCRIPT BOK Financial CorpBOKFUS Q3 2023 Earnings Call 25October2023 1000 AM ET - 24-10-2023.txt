Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's third quarter financial results. Starting on slide
4, third quarter net income was $134 million or $2.04 per diluted share. Our team had another solid quarter of
earnings, driven by our diverse business model, which prudently balances interest revenue with non-interest

revenues and allows us to perform well in a variety of business climates. Fee and commission revenues were
40% of total revenue for the quarter.
This quarter, our Public and Corporate Finance group established new record for investment banking fees, which
materially offset last quarter's record-high derivative fees. Additionally, we continue to focus on opportunities for
growth given the economic vitality of our core geographic footprint as we take advantage of our capital and
liquidity strengths.
Total loans have increased almost 9% from last year, and our core commercial and industrial loans were up 8%.
We are poised to introduce our full-service banking model into the San Antonio market with the addition of a fixed
income sales and trading office in Memphis. We are confident both will drive long-term shareholder value.
Turning to slide 5, period-end loan balances increased $486 million or 2.1% linked quarter, with growth in both
C&I and commercial real estate. Both period-end and average deposits continued to grow during the quarter. Our
loan-to-deposit ratio increased just slightly to 70.5% at the end of the quarter as loan growth outpaced deposit
growth. Our cost for deposits did increase linked quarter. However, the pace did slow. As Marty will detail later,
our reported net interest margin continues to be diluted by the expanding trading activity this quarter, with our
core margin, excluding the trading activity, at 3.14%. Although it will take a few quarters to become clear, we are
seeing early signs of loan spreads increasing in our footprint as credit tightens and deposit costs remain high. The
pressure on our net interest margin from increased funding cost resulted in a $21 million linked quarter decline in
net interest revenue, resulting in an efficiency ratio above 60%, which is more typical for us given the mix of non-
interest revenue.
Credit quality is still strong, and we have a combined reserve of $325 million or 1.37% of outstanding loans at
quarter-end, which is notably above the median of our peer group. Finally, we repurchased 700,500 shares this
quarter to reflect our long-term confidence in the company and attractive repurchase valuations.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Marc Maun will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to him.

Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans were $23.7 billion, up 2.1% linked quarter. Total C&I loans
increased $185 million or 1.3% linked quarter, with year-over-year growth of $1.1 billion or 8%. Commercial real
estate loans increased $270 million or 5.4% linked quarter and have increased $767 million or 17% year-over-
year. Compared to December 31, 2020, CRE balances have grown at a modest 3.8% annualized growth, with
commitments up 5.8% during that same period. Growth this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily properties,
with an increase of $232 million or 15.4% linked quarter.
Industrial facility loans grew $83 million or 6.1% linked quarter, which was offset by a $24 million or 2.4% linked
quarter decline in loans secured by office facilities. The $982 million in outstanding office loans is at its lowest
point since June 2020, and is only 4% of total outstanding loan balances. The year-over-year CRE growth of $767
million was predominantly driven by multifamily and industrial loans.
We have an internal limit of 185% of Tier 1 capital and reserve to total CRE commitment, and we're presently at
the upper end of that limit. We do expect continued modest growth in outstanding CRE balances as construction
loans fund up. As of September 30, CRE balances represented 22% of total outstanding loan balances, a ratio
well below our peers.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Combined services and general business loans, our core C&I loans increased $112 million or 1.6% linked quarter,
with year-over-year growth of $716 million or 11%. These combined categories are 30% of our total loan portfolio.
Healthcare balances increased $92 million or 2.3% linked quarter and have grown $257 million or 6.7% year-
over-year, primarily driven by our senior housing sector. Healthcare sector loans represented 17% of total loans
at quarter-end.
Energy balances decreased $18 million linked quarter and have increased $119 million or 3.5% year-over-year,
with period-end balances at 15% of total period-end loans. Year-over-year, loans have grown $1.9 billion or 8.9%.
Excluding [ph] triple B (06:51) loans, Q3 2023 extends the linked quarter loan growth to eight consecutive
quarters. Our current pipeline is strong, and we're confident we have momentum to drive additional growth in the
loan portfolio well into next year.
Turning to slide 8. You can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio and
well below historical norms and pre-pandemic levels. Non-performing assets, excluding those guaranteed by US
government agencies, decreased $12 million this quarter. Non-accruing loans decreased $13 million linked
quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in commercial real estate loans.
The provision for credit losses of $7 million in the third quarter reflects strong asset quality, continued loan growth,
and modest changes in our economic forecasts. We remain in a solid credit position today. With a ratio of capital
allocated to commercial real estate that is substantially less than our peers and a history of outperformance
during past credit cycles, we believe we are well positioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the
quarters ahead.
The markets continue to be focused on the office segment of real estate given the trends in workforce
preferences, although the verdict is still out as to whether that will be sustained as the pendulum seems to be
shifting back to more time in the physical office. Our office segment maturities are generally ratable over the next
three years to four years, and we have a [ph] mini-perm (08:18) option if the markets are not conducive to long-
term permanent financing.
The average loan-to-value ratio in the office space is below 65%, and average cash flow coverage exceeds 1.3
times based on our most recent review at the end of 2022. Net charge-offs were $6.5 million or 11 basis points
annualized for the third quarter and have averaged 13 basis points over the last 12 months, far below our historic
loss [ph] range (08:46) of 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to remain
low.
The combined allowance for credit losses was $325 million or 1.37% of outstanding loans at quarter-end. The
total combined allowance is available for losses, and any apples-to-apples industry comparison should include the
combined reserves. We expect this ratio to remain stable as loan growth continues and economic conditions
persist.
I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 10. Total fees and commissions were $198 million for the third quarter, down
slightly linked quarter. Our wealth segment continues to set new quarterly highs for fees and commissions at
$123.6 million this quarter, eclipsing the previous highs set last quarter. Fees and commissions for the second

quarter included record results for energy customer hedging, as well as annual tax service fees. Although energy
hedging customer and tax service fees were down linked quarter, these were partially offset by record results this
quarter in our Public and Corporate Finance groups, driving a $5.3 million increase in other investment banking
fees.
The $2.5 million linked quarter decline in trading fees was primarily related to fees from our municipal bond
trading portfolio, down $3.5 million linked quarter, which was influenced by a rising interest rate environment and
evolving market expectations during the third quarter. This was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in our
MBS trading activities.
Fiduciary and asset management fees were $52 million for the third quarter, a 1.4% linked quarter decrease due
to the second quarter's annual tax service fees. Our assets under management or administration were $99 billion
at quarter-end. Our asset mix for assets under management or administration moved slightly this quarter, with
43% fixed income, 32% equities, 16% cash, and 9% alternatives.
We are proud of our diversified mix of fee income, which we believe is a strategic differentiator for us when
compared to our peers, especially during times of economic uncertainty. We consistently rank in the top decile for
fee income as a percentage of total net interest revenue and non-interest fee income. Our revenue mix averaged
37% during the last 12 months. That consistently supports a revenue stream that is sustainable through a wide
variety of economic cycles.
I will now turn over the call to Marty.

Martin E. Grunst
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. Turning to slide 12. Third quarter net interest revenue was $301 million, a $21 million decrease
linked quarter. Net interest margin was 2.69%, a 31-basis-point decrease versus Q2. I will note that 8 basis points
of the 31-basis-point margin decline was due to growth in the trading securities. As the trading securities grow, it
is dilutive to the net interest margin as it grows earning assets at a narrower spread compared to the rest of the
balance sheet.
Net of the 8-basis-point impact from trading, the remaining 23-basis-point decline was driven by the competitive
deposit environment as average interest-bearing deposit costs increased by 61 basis points linked quarter. Our
cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased to 58% for the third quarter, and non-interest DDA continued
to shift into interest-bearing. DDA as a percent of total deposits was 29.6% as of September 30.
This slide shows net interest margin and net interest revenue with and without the impact of the trading business
to better highlight trends and comparability. For the third quarter of 2023, the net interest margin, excluding the
impact of trading assets, was 3.14% versus 3.36% in the second quarter. Growth in earning assets during the
quarter was driven by trading securities and loans, partially offset by a decline in our fair value option securities
used to hedge our mortgage servicing asset.
Turning to slide 13, liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers. Total
deposits grew $358 million on a period-end basis, and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 70.5%, up slightly from the
previous quarter. Average total deposits increased $918 million linked quarter, with average interest-bearing
deposits up $1.8 billion, partially offset by an $840 million decline in demand deposits.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Brokered CDs have recently been a topic for our industry, and we note that our usage of that funding source over
time is generally low but not zero. Brokered CDs were $688 million or less than 2% of total funding at quarter-end
and declined $72 million versus the prior quarter-end. Our tangible common equity ratio was 7.74%, down 5 basis
points linked quarter due to balance sheet growth and increases in interest rates, but up 11 basis points from
year-end 2022.
Adjusted TCE, including the impact of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities, is 7.35%, consistent with
year-end, too. CET1 is 12.1%, and if adjusted for AOCI, would be 9.7%. As the recent regulatory capital proposal
is largely focused on banks over $100 billion, we have ample capital to support continued organic growth while at
the same time allowing for our continued share buyback. During the third quarter, we repurchased 700,500
shares at an average price of $84.17 per share.
Turning to slide 14, linked quarter total expenses increased by $5.6 million or 1.8%. Personnel expense was flat
linked quarter as increases related to our San Antonio and Memphis expansions were mostly offset by a decrease
in employee benefits. Non-personnel operating expense grew to $5.5 million. Occupancy and equipment
increased $2.5 million, driven by the retirement of certain ATMs as we upgrade our network. FDIC insurance
expense increased $1 million. Combined, all other expense categories increased $3.3 million, much of that
related to an accrual for certain disputed matters.
Year-over-year total operating expense increased $30 million or 10%. Personnel expense increased $20 million
or 12%. However, $3 million of the year-over-year increase was related to a one-time benefit during the second
quarter of 2022 from the dissolution of our pension plan, combined with linked quarter market adjustments for
deferred compensation.
Third quarter 2023 also includes $2.6 million of expansion-related personnel costs. Cash-based compensation
related to new business production increased $6.8 million. The remaining $8 million year-over-year increase was
primarily regular salaries and benefits, with that directly related to annual merit increases and a much lower level
of open positions.
Year-over-year, other operating expense increased $9 million or 7.3%. Occupancy and equipment increased $3.3
million, with $2.5 million related to the ATM retirements. FDIC insurance increased $3.7 million as both the
assessment base and the rate increased. And data processing increased $3.9 million, primarily due to continued
investments in technology. These were partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in mortgage banking costs as
MSR amortization slowed.
Turning to slide 15, I will note that we are in the middle of our 2024 financial planning process, so we are not
ready to provide forward-looking assumptions with the same level of detail as we have for the last few quarters.
However, I will provide the following higher-level expectations for the next 15 months.
We continue to expect upper single-digit annualized loan growth. Economic conditions in our geographic footprint
remain favorable and continue to be supported by business in-migration from other markets. The competitive
environment for loans should be a tailwind for us. We expect to continue holding our available-for-sale securities
portfolio flat and to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position. We expect total deposits to be stable or grow
modestly, and the loan-to-deposit ratio to remain in the low-70s. Currently, we are assuming no additional rate
changes by the Federal Reserve in 2023 or 2024. We believe the margin will migrate modestly lower over the
next couple of quarters as interest-bearing deposit betas level out and demand deposit balance attrition runs its
course. In aggregate, we expect total fees and commissions revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit growth rate on
a year-over-year basis, and our strategic expansion initiatives to positively impact growth rates for 2024.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
We expect expenses to increase modestly as we continue to invest in strategic growth and technology initiatives,
with revenue growth following at a slight lag. We expect the efficiency ratio to increase with net interest margin
changes, then migrate downward as revenue growth is realized. This does not include the impact of the FDIC
special assessment, which could be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers, and we expect to maintain a strong credit
reserve. Given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality, we expect quarterly
provision expense near recent levels to continue, and an eventual move towards normal credit costs later in 2024.
Changes in the economic outlook will affect our provision expense. Additionally, we expect to continue our
opportunistic share repurchase activity.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. This quarter highlights the benefits of our diverse revenue mix and our strong risk management
culture as we and the industry experienced pressure on the margin from increased funding costs. While margin
pressure is a reality for us and our peers, our diverse fee-based businesses supply a strong core revenue base
that sets us apart.
Excluding the volatile mortgage refinance fees during the second and third quarters of 2020, the last five
consecutive quarters are the highest for fee income in the company's history. We continue to grow and invest in
our fee businesses, as shown by our recent expansion into Memphis, and our talented teams collaborate well to
ensure we grow our company the right way, a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles.
While the market continues to focus on capital, liquidity, and credit, I see this as a unique opportunity to use our
strength in these areas to grow organically and invest in new markets where other financial institutions may be
more internally focused. We are focused on using the strength of our geographic footprint to grow, both in today's
climate and in the years ahead.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The
first question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. It's Brady. Good morning, guys.

Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I was just wondering. Yeah. Your guidance for some continued net interest margin pressure. We saw a big move
in the third quarter. How do you think about the magnitude of how much the margin could decline over the next
quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good question, Brady. So I think the way to think about the next quarter or two, let me give you a little
context. So number one, I kind of set aside the trading impacts. There's really no reason to think that that would
be any different. It'll react to the markets. And even if it's different, that's really denominator effect and don't really
drive the numerator so much.
So Q3 margin decline ex-trading was 23 basis points. And so the positive drivers there were the bond portfolio
repricing up, the fixed rate portion of the loan book repricing up, and loan growth. The negatives were the DDA
mix shift and the deposit beta piece. So Q4 should basically see the same positives at very similar magnitude, but
the negatives, in aggregate, will be smaller. So we expect to see a smaller decline than that 23 basis points in the
core margin, Q3 to Q4, but still probably in the low double digits to basis points, and it's really the beta slowing
down that's going to be the component that helps there.
Going into Q1, we still think that the positives are about the same in magnitude, but the negatives will still
outweigh those positives to a lesser degree, and we'll see another but probably smaller margin decline. And then
after that, it's increasingly likely that the balances – that positives balance out or outweigh the negatives. But we'll
give you some more color on that in January.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Okay. And then loan growth at a high-single-digit pace is pretty robust today. I mean, relative to your peers,
there's not many banks growing at that level. So how are you able to kind of grow at that elevated pace relative to
your peers in the industry today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brady. This is Marc Maun. Fundamentally, our balance sheet is well positioned to allow us to grow the
liquidity and loan-to-deposit ratio of about 70%. We have the liquidity capacity to grow. Our credit metrics are as
good as they've ever been. I mean, with criticized levels at half where they were pre-pandemic, we don't see any
significant issues on the horizon. So we've been able to focus on our sales efforts and getting out and getting our
teams out in the field, working with companies to generate loan growth. And while some of our peers are pulling
back in that space, that has allowed us to grow not just in one particular area, but pretty broadly across our C&I
portfolio, healthcare, and energy. Real estate, we are expecting some modest growth just because of our own
internal limits. But we don't – we have no reason to discontinue that effort, and we're going to be very focused on
that in the – this quarter and in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Brady, this is Stacy. I just might add. I think that Marc really hit on – and it's been a real focal point for us as we've
seen the disruption in the industry, is others are having to manage their liquidity and capital constraints. We're not.
This is a really unique opportunity we have that maybe you get once every 15 years or so to definitely take market
share and grow when others are less able to do that. And so that's been a real significant focus for us.
And what I like about the growth is how it's been core C&I growth where really, over the last year, energy is such
an important part of our business, but energy hasn't driven that. Historically, a lot of times, when we have strong
C&I growth, energy is the big driver. We've had huge growth in commitments there, but the outstandings have
not. And so if you think about by market, it's really been across our footprint. Each of the markets has really had a
strong year in terms of growth in C&I particularly, and it's been a focus for us. And so I think that we're optimistic
that we can maintain that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. All right. And then finally, for me, is just on the fee income side. It's been such a great story for BOK this
year, growing fee income. Is there any pieces of your fee income that you think are over-earning right now that
could normalize lower, or is all this growth real? Mid-single-digit fee growth is great for this year. Like is that the
way we should kind of think about fee income growth longer term for BOK in this mid-single-digit level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brady. This is Marty. Yeah. We do think that that is good, solid franchise growth that we've been able to
generate. And if you look out over any 12-month or so period, we're able to grow that consistently at that mid-
single-digit level, and we feel the same about that today than we did a quarter ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
And Brady, this is Scott. I would add that the – if you look at the components second quarter to third quarter, we
had record highs in the second quarter in a couple of different lines. So our energy had – we had different pieces

that were at the top of the list in the second quarter, that's alternated in the third quarter where we have
investment banking and other areas. So it's not coming from any one particular segment or piece. So you've got
diversification of those fee and commission revenue sources, just like we do at the top of the house, from a
revenue perspective. So we feel good about the fact that the various business lines have the ability to generate
fees and commissions, just all types of fee revenues, regardless of what cycle we're in.

Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. I was wondering, can you provide some guidance, Marty, how you're thinking about net interest
income in the fourth quarter? Just there are so many moving parts. And how are you thinking about the trading
portfolio and where you think net interest income would bottom? Do you think it's kind of the second quarter we
could get to the bottom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Peter, let me just give you a little bit of color on the net interest revenue, kind of the components. So
loan growth, that'll give you something like – we had about $450 million of loan growth, and that's coming on at a
[ph] 250-basis-point (27:52) spread. That's one of your positives. Bond portfolio reprice, that averages $450
million a quarter, and you kind of get a runoff rate around 275 basis points and a reinvestment yield that's
whatever the current market rates were. But in the third quarter, we're able to do that at [ph] 550 basis points
(28:13). Fixed rate loan reprice, that's about another $350 million, that's repricing up each quarter, 300 basis
points. And so those are the positives. Deposit betas were still a pretty large impact in Q3. We saw a nice
slowdown in the pace of increase in September. And so we ended the quarter with a 58% cumulative beta. And
so we can see that flowing until that slowdown will benefit Q4 and forward. And then the DDA mix shift, we still
see that as a higher number in Q4, with likely slowdown after that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Peter, this is Stacy. I think the answer, to be specific, I think that Marty just kind of provided the pieces there. But
our view is that you'll have more margin deterioration in the fourth quarter, less in the first quarter. And our current
view is that it's likely in the first quarter that both margin and net interest revenue are kind of where they trough,
and then we begin to build back from there, plus or minus with not a high degree of precision around the absolute
numbers. But certainly directionally, we think that we likely bottom somewhere around the first quarter.

Peter J. Winter Q

Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then Stacy, just expenses, If I think about the company and the strategy, and I
understand with competitors pulling back and you're taking advantage of this opportunity and investing. Is there
any thought of maybe slowing down some of this investment spending next year just given somewhat of a
challenging revenue environment?

Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No. I mean, if you think about – I mean, Peter, you've followed us for most of my career here, it feels like. I mean,
our view is we're running this company not for the next quarter or for the next year, but for the next 5 years or 10
years or 15 years. And so you get these opportunities like this, you have to take advantage of it. And I understand
the optics, but because of our mix of fee revenue, we're not a sub-60% efficiency ratio company. We've never
been.
And so having a low-60s efficiency ratio doesn't bother us at all because we've got 40% to 50% of our revenues
from fee-based businesses that carry a higher efficiency ratio. And so we're going to be prudent about expenses.
We're not going to do anything that's imprudent there. But we're going to grow the company, and we're going to
think about things from a long-term perspective, not a short-term perspective. That may be the most distinctive
advantage we have as a financial institution, and we're going to take advantage of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And just my last question, just deposit betas, I guess the outlook was 64% by year-end. I'm just wondering
if you could update that and how you're thinking about it next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. We are thinking about that still as 64%, 65% for the end of this year, and then we do expect that to slow
quite a bit next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Any idea where it kind of settles out on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's probably a little too early to tell, but quite a bit lower. I mean, we saw some nice slowdown in
September, and we expect to see that slowdown continue.

Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Marc, maybe a question for you. In your prepared comments, you talked about some limits on commercial real
estate concentrations, and I'm just curious what that means for overall commercial real estate growth. And I'm
particularly interested in the multifamily and industrial because they've been such big drivers of growth for you
guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Right. What I talked about was, we do try to manage our exposure in real estate to a certain percentage of capital.
And we're at the upper end of that range. So we have seen growth. A lot of the growth that we've seen this year
has been funding up of existing deals and construction loans, and the number of payoffs have slowed due to the
situation in long-term market. So we expect that we still have room for modest growth in that next year, but it's not
going to be at the double-digit rate that we've seen year-over-year in CRE so far.
We are focused on multifamily and industrial. That's where the growth has been. We don't see those markets
slowing down too much. We're not focused on retail and certainly not on the office piece. So we – again, it will be
something modest. It won't be in the same kind of growth rate we had overall this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Also, on that same slide, talk about what you're doing in office. I know it's not huge exposure for you,
but I do see it's down. And you talked – you made a comment about a mini-perm option to solve some potential
issues. Can you talk a little bit about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, right – currently, our office portfolio is very strong from a credit standpoint. If we reach a maturity with one of
the office loans, at this point in time, they're all in good shape, and we would have the ability to extend that loan
for a short period of time until longer-term markets may open up. But we really have no credit – no significant
credit issues at all in the office portfolio at this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
So Jon, for us, a mini-perm would be some kind of 20-year amortization on a 3-year term – 3-year maturity based
on the property continuing to perform as agreed. And so the borrower doesn't have to find a permanent
refinancing source. We can give them a short maturity, but a longer [ph] AM (34:40) consistent with the
permanent market to like bridge them until when the permanent markets are more healthy.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. And then your stock is getting beat up a little bit this morning, and it's on the NII and
margin guide, I think, primarily. But you've been active in the buyback. I'm just curious – and you bought a lot
higher, quite frankly. So I'm just curious, your kind of buyback appetite and capacity, especially where the stock is.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think you can assume that given where the stock is today and given where we bought it in the third
quarter, we would have a very high appetite for repurchasing shares.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And capacity in general?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. We have very strong capital ratios, and we've got the capacity we need to do that.

Operator. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. So I wanted to get more context around how you're thinking about the efficiency ratio trends over next year
or so or maybe beyond a year, just given your initiatives and how the net interest income is trending and fee
income. Just when do you think that efficiency ratio finally peaks and you finally see maybe some stability or
maybe it's coming down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Brandon, the efficiency ratio has never been a metric that we manage to. And so we're obviously in the middle of
our budget preparations for next year. So we're not going to provide guidance around that today. But what I can

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
tell you is every business that we have has a target kind of efficiency ratio that we think about. And so what
changes our efficiency ratio over time, more than anything else, is the mix of fee businesses. When fee
businesses are a higher percent of total revenue, the efficiency ratio comes up. And when net interest revenues
are higher percentage, then the efficiency ratio will go down.
But we'll continue to look at that by line of business and manage each line of business inside of the – our kind of
implied expectations for efficiency. We'll continue to look for opportunities as we go through this fall season to
look for opportunities for efficiency. But we don't run our company that way because so much of the mix of
revenue guides that efficiency ratio. So that's not how we think about, nor how we run the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just to follow-up on that with these initiatives and the expectations for when that revenue growth will be
realized. And I know there's a lot of moving parts around that, but could you just give us some more context on
how you're thinking about when and the timing of that, which is based off of preliminary plans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Just to give you a couple of examples, Brandon, so if you think about our Memphis expansion as one of
those, that's sales and trading producers. So that has a fairly rapid ramp-up just given the nature of that business.
Our San Antonio investment, that's commercial and wealth, primarily. And so those all have longer sales cycles.
And so that'll take a little bit longer to ramp that up than when compared to the Memphis expansion. So it's kind of
individual investment-centric. So hopefully that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then on the technology initiatives, could you just give us more color on kind of what you're
planning on doing that you're currently not doing now and how you expect that to ramp as you try to manage the
company over the next five years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
So Brandon, over the last several years, we've made material investments in our Treasury platform and our
customer interface into our commercial and corporate interface, into our existing technology systems. We have
significant investments in our wealth platform that are under way that we're continuing to work through. And so as
I mentioned previously, we're running the company for the long term, not the short term. And so we continue to
make investments to ensure our technology platforms are competitive and providing our customers with a really
positive experience when they interface with us.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to loan growth, and I think it's good to hear you guys talk about the
bank taking advantage of some competition pulling back some as they manage their capital liquidity. Any
commentary about how much of the growth is from larger-sized deals or syndications? I just want to appreciate
how much of the growth is larger deals, existing syndications versus taking on new customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, it's a combination of all that. Actually, we have not had any material increase like in the third quarter in the
number of SNCs that we're involved with. Our leverage loans are actually going down. So we're focused on
businesses where we can develop a relationship that's broad-based. And so we're getting a mix of new
customers, as well as finding our way into some club deals, et cetera, but nothing – we're not focused on just
getting into syndicated deals and buying participation where we don't have a significant opportunity for
relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
It's core middle market right down the middle of the fairway as we consistently are over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. The – as Marc mentioned, the SNC – number of SNCs isn't different for us between second quarter and
third quarter. To the extent that we're in a Shared National Credit, there is a direct relationship with the borrower.
We typically have other business associated with them. And I think the growth that we're seeing is really and why
I'm excited about it is because it is core. It is direct relationships. People that we've been calling on, opportunities
that are being created. And so that's really important to us, and it's franchise-building over the long term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q

Timur F. Braziler Q

Hi. Good morning. Following up on that last line of commentary, do you have the total balance of Shared National
Credits and participations in the quarter?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. The Shared National Credit volumes were about 24% of our total portfolio, and that's kind of mostly in the
energy and C&I space that made those two areas make up about 80% of the total Shared National Credits. We
do [ph] Asian (42:08), about a quarter of those, and about 80% of them are in our local market. So we're not going
outside of our footprint in tracking down those kinds of loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Switching to the deposit base, the decline linked quarter in demand deposits still – it's pretty elevated.
Demand is now less than 30% of the total base and is below pandemic levels. I guess what are you seeing from a
liquidity standpoint from your borrowers? I know you said that that pressure seems to be abating. I guess what's
the outlook for demand deposits as we go into the fourth quarter and into 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we saw DDA average balances down $841 million in Q2 to Q3. And when that happens, that's a shift
from DDA to an interest-bearing within the firm. Then so we'll see going from Q3 to Q4, we expect the decline to
be near that amount going Q3 to Q4. And then, in Q1, we expect to see that rate of decline slow quite a bit. So
when we look at kind of deeper into the portfolio and look at size cohorts, we can see the rate of change slowing,
and that's what gives us some confidence that we'll see a slowdown here over the next six months. Q4 will still be
a higher number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I guess as you guys are thinking about funding the high-single-digit loan growth next year and pairing
that with the comment for stable to maybe slightly growing deposits, how are you thinking about funding that
growth? And I guess it appears that the spread you're getting on that loan growth relative to the funding sources is
shrinking. And I'm just wondering, obviously, you have a longer-term outlook, but why grow loans at such a fast
pace when that spread is going to be shrinking and there is broader economic uncertainty out there right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So if you look at the incremental loan growth, the spread on that incremental loan volume is actually
widening. So we've been able to see a widening of spreads on new production, and the economics of that new
production is strong, not to mention the fact that that's coming with full relationships, so there's deposits, et cetera.
But that incremental loan growth does have incrementally positive and wider spreads.
So the funding question, it's going to be a mix of, yes, some deposit growth, and there may be some smaller
amount of wholesale funding in there as well. But either way, it doesn't matter which side of the – whether it's
funded with wholesale or deposits, that is incremental and profitable, to be sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that color.
