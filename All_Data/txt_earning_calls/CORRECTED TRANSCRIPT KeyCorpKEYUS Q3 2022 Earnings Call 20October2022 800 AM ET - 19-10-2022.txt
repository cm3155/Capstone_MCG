MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and
CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Well, thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Clark Khayat, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our
Chief Risk Officer.
On slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers
our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I am now
moving to slide 3. This morning, we reported earnings of $513 million or $0.55 per common share.
Our results included $0.06 per share of additional loan loss provision in excess of net charge-offs. Revenue was
up 5% relative to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, with a 13 basis point increase in our
net interest margin. One thing that sets Key apart is our approach to managing interest rate risk. We have been
very deliberate and intentional in managing with a long-term perspective. While our net interest income is
expected to be up double digits this year, our balance sheet positioning presents a unique and significant upside
for Key over the next two years.
Even in the event that rates remain at current levels, we will experience a meaningful benefit as our securities and
swaps reprice. If we were to reprice our existing short-term treasuries and swaps at today's interest rates, we
would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over $1.2 billion.
Our balance sheet benefits from our strong stable deposit base. Approximately 60% of our deposits are in stable,
low cost, retail and escrow balances. In our commercial businesses, approximately 85% of our deposits are from
core operating accounts. We grew our loans again this quarter as we continue to add and expand relationships
with our targeted clients. Our growth came from both our commercial and our consumer businesses.
We remain diligent in our underwriting practices and have walked away from business that does not meet our
moderate risk profile. Our fee-based businesses continue to reflect current market conditions. Investment banking
and debt placement fees were up $5 million from the prior quarter, but down meaningfully from the year-ago
period, reflecting the slowdown in the capital markets.
The new issue equity market is virtually non-existent and the M&A market is currently engaged in price discovery.
Our pipelines remain solid, particularly, in M&A. However, the pull-through rate continues to be adversely
impacted by market uncertainty. We continue to see more activity moving on to our balance sheet.
In the third quarter, we raised a record $39 billion for our clients, of which 23% was retained on our balance sheet,
well above our long-term average of 18%. We will continue to do what is best for our clients, including offering on
and off balance sheet solutions.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Importantly, we continue to make progress with respect to our targeted scale sectors, which are not only high
growth opportunities for Key, but areas that matter to both our country and our economy. We have made a
conscious decision to invest and focus our resources in certain vital growing sectors, including healthcare,
renewable energy and affordable housing that impact both our clients and our communities.
Both renewable energy and affordable housing are areas of investment and recently passed federal legislation,
combined the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill have allocated over $300 billion for
energy transition. In healthcare, we are growing relationships with significant healthcare providers and expanding
our Laurel Road business including our recent market extension to include nurses.
We are also very pleased with the early results from our May 2022 acquisition of GradFin. Since the GradFin
team joined Key, they have held over 14,000 individual consultations for refinance and public service loan
forgiveness. These consultations are with prequalified credential prospects, all new to Key. Our expenses
continue to reflect our investments in our teammates, digital and analytics. We continue to balance expense
discipline with investments for the future.
Credit quality remained strong this quarter with net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans of 15 basis
points. Nonperforming loans declined from the prior quarter. We remain committed to delivering sound, profitable
growth by maintaining our discipline with respect to risk. We will continue to support our clients, while maintaining
our moderate risk profile, which positions the company to perform well through all business cycles.
Our capital remains a strength, providing us with sufficient capacity to support our clients and return capital to our
shareholders. Our fourth quarter guidance keeps us on the path to deliver positive operating leverage again in
2022 and concurrently make progress against each of our long-term goals. We also continue to make tangible
progress against the three commitments we announced earlier this year at our Investor Day. These goals for
2025 are as follows: growing relationship households in our consumer business by 20%; growing our senior
bankers by 25%; and growing our Laurel Road member households to 250,000 from 50,000.
We are on pace to achieve all three measures. We have grown consumer households and Laurel Road members,
as well as a number of our senior bankers. Although our senior banker hires have been slower in the back half of
this year, reflecting current market conditions. Overall, Key delivered another solid quarter. I remain confident in
our future and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Don to provide more details on the results of the quarter and our outlook. Don?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.55 per
common share, up $0.01 from the prior quarter and down $0.10 from last year. Our results in the current quarter
reflect strong core operating performance and the resiliency of our business model as we continue to navigate
through the current market conditions.
Pre-provision net revenues was up 9% from the second quarter with a 5% increase in revenue driven by loan
growth and by the way that we positioned our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates. Our results also
reflect our ongoing focus on expense management and our strong risk profile.
Turning to slide 6. Average loans for the quarter were $114 billion, up 14% from the year-ago period, and up 5%
from the prior quarter. We continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise, which drove loan

growth in both our commercial and consumer businesses. Commercial loans increased 5% from last quarter,
reflecting broad-based growth across our industry verticals.
Our consumer business continued with its strong performance as we saw residential real estate originations of
$1.9 billion. Consistent with our focus on healthcare segment, 30% of our consumer mortgage originations were
to healthcare professionals. Laurel Road originated approximately $200 million of loans this quarter, reflecting the
ongoing federal student loan payment holiday as well as the impact of interest rates.
Continuing on to slide 7. Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the third quarter of 2022, down $3 billion or 2%
compared to both the prior quarter and the year-ago period. Year-over-year, we saw a decline in non-operating
commercial deposit balances, partially offset by an increase in retail deposits. The decline from the prior quarter
reflected lower commercial and consumer balances, both areas were impacted by a reduction in stimulus-related
funds.
Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 17 basis points from the prior quarter. This resulted in a cumulative
deposit beta of 9%. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting
for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. In addition, 85% of our commercial deposits are from core
operating accounts.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.2 billion for the third quarter, compared to $1.0
billion in the year-ago quarter and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.74% for the third
quarter compared to 2.47% for the same period last year and 2.61% for the prior quarter. Year-over-year, net
interest income benefited from higher earning asset balances and a favorable balance sheet mix as well as the
benefit of higher interest rates.
Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income and margin benefited from higher interest rates and loan growth,
partially offset by higher interest-bearing deposit costs. Both net interest income and net interest margin reflect
lower loan fees related to PPP loan forgiveness as well as the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio in
the third quarter of 2021. Included in the appendix is additional detail on our investment portfolio and asset liability
positioning.
As Chris mentioned, we have intentionally positioned Key to continue to benefit from higher interest rates over the
next few years. For example, if we were to reprice our existing $9 billion in short-term treasuries and $26 billion of
swaps to today's interest rates, we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over $1.2 billion. This
positions us to continue to grow net interest income and the net interest margin over each of the next few years
even if rates do not increase.
Moving to slide 9. Noninterest income was $683 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $797 million for
the year-ago period and $688 million in the second quarter. Our fee businesses continue to be impacted by the
slowdown in capital markets. Investment banking and debt placement fees were $154 million for the quarter, up
$5 million from last quarter, but down $81 million year-over-year. Compared to last year, in addition to lower
investment banking fees, cards and payments income was $20 million lower, driven by lower prepaid card
revenue, which was partially offset by core growth.
Consumer mortgage income was also lower, reflecting lower gain on sale margins. Strength in the corporate
services income from higher derivatives income partially offset these declines. Quarter-over-quarter fees were
down $5 million. Trust and investment services income declined, reflecting lower commercial brokerage
commissions. Operating lease income was lower due to lease terminations in the quarter. Increases in cards and
5

payments income and the $5 million increase in investment banking fees partially offset these declines. Despite
the increase in other income, this line also reflects a $9 million reduction related to the [ph] Visa (00:12:05)
litigation settlement.
This quarter, we also reclassified certain customer-related derivative income items from our other income line to
corporate services income. This change was reflected in the current period as well as reclassified in prior periods
for comparability.
I'm now on slide 10. Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, relatively stable with last year and
up $28 million from last quarter. Our expenses reflect our ongoing investments in digital, analytics and our
teammates. Compared to the year ago quarter, our expenses were down $6 million. We saw declines across
most non-personnel line items, including business services and professional fees.
Higher personnel costs partially offset these declines related to an increase in salaries expense. This increase
included $8 million of lower deferred costs from slower loan originations and $10 million of higher contract labor
related to technology initiatives.
Compared to the prior quarter, non-interest expense is up $28 million. Higher personnel costs drove this increase.
This increase was caused by higher salaries related to seasonal staffing and $10 million of lower deferred costs
from slower loan originations.
In addition, higher incentive and stock-based compensation was driven by a $12 million increase related to the
relative stock price change on incentive compensation. Partially offsetting these increases were declines across
most non-personnel line items, including occupancy and business services and professional fees.
Now, moving on to slide 11. Overall credit quality remains strong. For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $43
million or 15 basis points of average loans. Non-performing loans were $390 million this quarter or 34 basis points
of period-end loans, a decline of $39 million from the prior quarter.
We did see a very slight increase in our 30 to 89 day delinquencies and criticized loans this quarter, although both
remain near historic lows. Our provision for credit losses was $109 million for the quarter, up from $45 million in
the second quarter and exceeding net charge-offs by $66 million. The increase in the provision was driven by the
change in the economic outlook.
Now on to slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.1% within our targeted
range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity continued to support our customers and their
borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.
We will continue to manage our capital consistent with our capital priorities. First, supporting organic growth of our
businesses; second, paying dividends, and as we've mentioned before, our board of directors will evaluate a
dividend increase in the fourth quarter; and third, repurchasing shares.
During the quarter, our board of directors approved an extension of our share repurchase authorization of $790
million, which is now in place through the third quarter of 2023. We did not complete any share repurchases in the
current period.
As we have in prior years, we have updated slide 13 to show our fourth quarter outlook relative to our third quarter
results. Using the midpoints of our guidance ranges would support Chris' comments about delivering another year

of positive operating leverage in 2022. We expect average loans will be up between 2% and 4% and average
deposits up 1% to 3%.
Net interest income is expected to be up between 4% and 6%, reflecting growth in average loan balances and
higher interest rates. Our guidance is based on the forward curve, assuming a Fed funds rate of 4.25% by the end
of 2022.
Noninterest income is expected to be up between 1% and 3%. This reflects an expected seasonal pickup in
investment banking and debt placement fees, but we would expect the fourth quarter of 2022 to be well below the
fourth quarter 2021 results.
This also accounts for the implementation of our new NSF ODP structure, which will decrease service charges on
deposit accounts, by approximately $25 million this quarter. The higher interest rate environment will also impact
the earnings credit in our commercial businesses and is expected to further pressure this line item.
We expect noninterest expense to be up between 1% and 3% for the fourth quarter, reflecting higher incentive
compensation relative to fee production as well as $20 million of one-time charges in the fourth quarter, including
a pension settlement charge, which will flow through other expense.
Over the quarter, we expect credit quality to remain strong and net charge-offs to be at the lower end of our 15 to
25 basis point range. Our guidance for the GAAP tax rate remains the same at approximately 19%. Finally, shown
at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged.
We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving
our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we remain confident in
our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call, operator?

Good morning.

You changed your name, Steve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. So I want to start on the deposit side. So if we look at the $4 billion decline in the noninterest bearing, right,
you're appropriately calling out the decline in non-operating deposits. If you look at the $47 billion where you
ended the quarter, how much of that is still non-operational and at risk to see outflows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
I would say that at the end of the quarter, when we look at our commercial balances, it's still in that 85% range.
And we do believe that part of that decline, to be honest, is that we were a little stingy on some of our deposit
rates, and it's part of our outlook for the fourth quarter of showing deposits increase.
We really have two factors. One is seasonal changes and then also, two, is to use some of that deposit beta and
maybe retain or attract additional customer relationships that are non-operating.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful commentary, Don. Follow-up, so if we look at the interest-bearing deposit costs and only 25
basis points in the three month T-bill now at 4%. Why aren't deposits costs going to materially ramp in the
quarters ahead for you guys or really for everybody?
I know that historically, retail was sleepy, right, the money that move, but it's a different error today. What gives
you confidence that you could continue to see NIM expansion, which you clearly are signaling with the
commentary on treasuries and swaps? Can you really flesh that out for us? Thanks.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
So Steve, it's Chris, a couple of things. One, when we were awash in liquidity, we were pretty disciplined about
how – what deposits we kept and what deposits we pushed out. So, our starting point is a bit differentiated from
where it's been in other cycles.
The other thing to keep in mind is that 65% or 60% of our deposits are both consumer deposits and our escrow
business, which has significant deposits. And we've been really focused on – our pillars have been focused on
four things, one of which has been primacy for some time. So, I think we're in a little bit different position than
we've ever been in as the cycle changes.
What we're seeing is that our cumulative beta is 9% through the first three quarters. We think our cumulative beta
will be 15% for the year. We're projecting an endpoint on a spot basis of just above 30%. So we are anticipating a
fairly significant ramp, but not the kind of experience that we've had before based on all the work we did prior to
the rise in interest rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So is it safe to say most banks are guiding that NIMs are going to peak in the first half of next year and then
trend down in the second half. Are you guys confident you'll see NIM expansion through 2023? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
We'll provide more in the 2023 outlook in January. But you're right. As we look at how we're positioned with the
benefit that Chris and I both referred to as far as just the short-term swaps and the short-term treasuries and
those rollovers that we do believe that we're going to grow net interest income and margin even beyond that first
half of 2023, and so even with this increased deposit beta.
And so that was intentional on our part to have more of a long-term focus as far as how we manage interest rate
risk. And we think that while it's costing us a little bit on a relative basis now, we think that we'll be recouping that
throughout the later periods of 2023 and 2024.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
You mentioned, Chris, the $1.2 billion benefit over time early on in your prepared remarks and Don, you
mentioned it again. So, I guess let me ask the question. Number one, your C&I loan beta was 53% this quarter. Is
that essentially the impact from the swaps? And should we expect a similar loan beta as the Fed continues to
raise rates? And as we think about that $1.2 billion benefit coming back, how much of that is coming from the
swap book versus the securities book? And over what period of time do you realize that $1.2 billion back into your
net interest income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Sure. Maybe I can go ahead and take a crack at that, Erika. And I don't have it broken out for C&I but for total
commercial, the swap impact for commercial yields cost us 43 basis points on a linked quarter basis. And so,
instead of the increase that you're seeing for commercial yields that just the actual loan itself would have
translated to 116 basis point increase.
And so I think that's going to be much more consistent with what you might be seeing for some others that don't
have that hedge impact. And so this quarter, we did see that kind of relative change on that category as far as the
impact from swaps.
As far as that $1.2 billion that it really relates to the swap book and the maturities and also the short-term
treasuries. Those treasuries, which total about $9 billion, really mature throughout late 2023 and throughout 2024.
The swap book between now and the end of 2023, we've got $7.3 billion of swap maturities and another $7.5
billion in 2024. And so if we just look at that time period for the next two years and using that same math as far as
repricing, we'll have $900 million of that $2 billion annualized net income pickup occur in that two year time period.

Donald R. Kimble A

Of the $1.2 billion, I'm sorry, yes. The $900 million out of the $1.2 billion occur in that two year time period.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my follow-up question is on expenses. I think that Key has always been very good at managing
expenses, particularly relative to fees. And I think that it probably surprised the Street in terms of the personnel
costs relative to what happened on the fee side, especially.

KeyCorp

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
And I'm wondering, given that you called out some of the $12 million and the $10 million in your slides, how
should we think about the $655 million going forward? And I guess my other question, and I'm sorry, I'm not
getting this out quickly is, is this just something that even though the capital markets remain dislocated, inflation
and the competition for talent will continue to push this – pressure this upward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
A couple of things. One, our expenses were higher than what we had guided to for this quarter and for the second
half of the year. If you look at the components of what drove that change. And I'll get to your question as part of
this is that, there are three items that really caused our outlook for all of 2022 to be higher than what we
previously expected.
One is more one-time items. We've got a pension settlement loss projected in the fourth quarter and also some
branch consolidation – not branch, our building consolidation type of costs associated with that. And those two
combined to $20 million.
Outside of personnel, but within our operating losses, during the second quarter, we were seeing our operating
losses from the prepaid card product come down through the second quarter. And we expected that to continue
through the third and fourth quarter. And what we actually saw was those costs actually go up.
And so it wasn't a huge increase, but compared to what our relative positioning was and the expectation was for
that category. It's about a $30 million increase for the second half of the year expense structure for us.
And the good thing about that is, is that we have taken action to address that, and we'll start to see that over time,
but the other good thing is it has a limited life to it. These are related to funds that were distributed as part of the
stimulus programs and they're winding down. And so we don't think that will have an ongoing impact with us.
The third component, Erika, really is deferred loan origination costs and that cost us about $20 million. And most
of that is with our reset of our consumer loan originations and the cost that gets deferred associated with that. And
so we will see increases from that continue for some time period, Erika, we're not seeing a return of the previous
origination levels. So that will be there.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to see our capital markets revenues pick up. And as we've said before, the
incentive compensation expense tend to be correlated to the tune of about $0.30 on the dollar. So for every dollar
of investment banking and debt placement fee increase, we will see that come through incentives.
As far as where we see for other salary and personnel costs that I would say, just looking at the year-over-year
adjusting for some of these items I talked about for the deferred loan origination costs and things.
Our total salary dollars were up about 10% and head count is up about 5%. Now some of that includes some of
the smaller acquisitions we've done throughout the year. And so that does imply a 4% to 5% inflationary impact
for some of the salaries. Some of that is because of the lower end of the pay scale, continue to have increases.
Some of it's market pressure, and we'll be working through that as we said, our expectation for merit increases for
2023 and beyond. And I think that the important thing here, Erika, also is that we're very focused on driving
positive operating leverage. We expect to do that this year. And we haven't given guidance for 2023 or beyond
yet, but we expect to continue that through the next several years as well.

Related to your last comment there on the operating leverage. I mean your cash efficiency ratio is running at
about 60% year-to-date. And just wondering how – if you could help us think how you're thinking about that for
2023? And if not, maybe if you could help us with the magnitude of pos op leverage that we could see in 2023?
And then separately, your long-term target, you maintain that at 54% to 56%. How should we think about what
you need to see to be able to achieve that level? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
John, it's Chris. Good morning. So I think our efficiency ratio for the quarter we just printed was right around 58%.
It's not – we do aspire to get to 54% to 56%. But as Don mentioned, what we're really focused on is positive
operating leverage. And if you think about our capital markets business coming back, if you think about some of
the many investments that we continue to make coming to fruition, and you think about the trajectory that Don
described from an NII perspective. Obviously, that continues to move us toward that long-term target that you
referenced of 54% to 56%.

John Pancari Q

Okay. All right. Thanks, Chris. And then separately, in terms of deposit growth expectations, I appreciate the color
you gave near-term. I wanted to just get a little bit of color on how you think about deposit growth as you look into
2023. Maybe if you could talk about the mix shift of non-interest bearing towards interest-bearing and then overall
growth levels. Do you think incremental declines are possible as we look into the early part of 2023? Thanks.

Well, I mean, we're really kind of going into a bit of uncharted territory. I will tell you this, though, we have been
pretty consistent and that our non-interest bearing have been right around 32%, and that hasn't moved. And I
don't anticipate that moving a lot as we go forward.
And as I mentioned earlier, this deposit book has been pretty well scrubbed over a period of time. Having said all
that, as interest rates continue to rise, some deposits that previously were deemed to be not interest rate sensitive
will in fact be interest rate sensitive. And we saw some of that movement in the third quarter where some of our
public sector customers that are more interest rate sensitive moved. So we're obviously watching it very closely,
and it's certainly an interesting dynamic, particularly as the Fed unwinds their balance sheet concurrently.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Chris, you talked about the strength in the commercial and industrial loan growth and you've taken on more of
originations than you have in the past as more of your customers are coming on to your balance sheet rather than
going to the capital markets.
A couple of questions, one, can you share with us what percentage of that portfolio is considered leveraged
loans? And then also, in that same kind of vein, how big is your syndicated loan portfolio? And did that impact the
growth this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
So a couple of things. Our leverage book, Gerard, has been pretty consistent at about 2.5% of total loans. And
what's interesting about that is it's been 2.5% even when we were a much smaller company.
So that portfolio has a lot of velocity. It's in our – it's in the segments in which we focus. There's been some talk
about some of the deals that are hung lately. We've just had just a de minimis mark over the last six months in
that book. So we feel really, really good about that.

Most of the growth that you're seeing conversely is really an investment grade credit. And the market was
dislocated enough and our clients were trying to do things in an expeditious manner. And we have really grown
the percentage of our C&I book that's investment grade as we brought more onto the balance sheet. Right now,
our C&I book is about 50% investment grade, which is a bit of an outlier for a bank of our size.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And when you underwrite the new originations, do you guys – I assume you always do this, but are you stressing
in for 200 or 300 basis points higher rates just so that you're protected if rates are to go quite a bit higher from
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
For sure, I mean our first stress that we always run is actually 300 basis points, and we run a lot of stress – other
stresses. And when you get into anything that's leveraged, we stress EBITDA and we stress interest rates
because that's the danger of anything that's leveraged as you have the concurrent decline of EBITDA and the
increase in borrowing costs. And we do a lot of stressing with respect to those credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, your credit quality, obviously, is superb, like many of your peers,
and I know that's going to be a defining moment for you folks through the cycle.
So the question I have is on, the consumer loan portfolio with the FICO scores, I think you showed it averages out
to 772. Have you guys – there's been some chatter that FICO scores like I think college grades have been
inflated. Are you guys seeing anything where are these FICO scores? If you compare them to five years ago, they
are inflated or is that really not the case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
I haven't personally done the analysis, but just because we look at this stuff all the time. I think there's probably a
lot of like they teach the SAP, I think there's some instruction on how to get your FICO score up.
Having said that, if you think about the super prime customers that we're focused on doctors, dentists, which for
example were 30% of our mortgage originations last quarter, we feel really, really good about our consumer book,
as we look kind of across all the metrics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
And Gerard, you're right. There actually was some technical change in some of the FICO scores. And I don't
know if it was by law or what, but they had to exclude certain I think medical-related costs or loans or expenses.
And – so if you would adjust for that, I think that today's FICO score is probably 10 to 15 basis points higher than
the same would be several years ago. And so instead of our 772, it might be a 760, which is still super prime even
on historic standards.

I guess, Don, just wanted to follow up on the swap and the treasury securities portfolio. So get in terms of how
this should help NII. That's obviously assuming that rates stay high for the next 12 to 18 months, is there anything
that you plan to do ahead of time to lock in that upside?
Or – just give us a sense of – because what I worry is if we get to the next three to six months, rates lower, do we
start losing some of that benefit that you would have otherwise had? And is there a way that you expect to lock
that in ahead of time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
We're continuing to review that on a regular basis. I would say that our ALCO committee as we get together, we
tend to think that we're going to see rates higher for longer, just given what we've experienced in the current
marketplace. But even with that, you've seen a little bit of a tick up again as far as our forward starting swaps.
And that's exactly the purpose of that Ebrahim is that we're looking to put on swaps that actually kick in as some
of these will mature and start to lock in some of that forward benefit for us as well. And we're not ready to do a
wholesale type of repositioning to achieve that, but we do expect to continue to use that tool over the next several
quarters to help lock in some of that benefit.

That's fair. And I guess, just on a separate question, following up on credit, less to do with your portfolio, which
you have a lens into sort of the middle market commercial CRE, like how stressed do you expect that customer
base? Are you seeing areas where you've kind of pulled back given the rapid rise in Fed interest rates and what
we're seeing in the markets in terms of spread widening, like what are the areas where you're seeing pain where
you pulled back as a bank? And where do you – like do you actually start seeing a 4%, 4.5% Fed funds as more
certainly creating pressure for a subset of that segment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure, I'll take that one. Clearly, I mean, last year – and our view for some time has been that these work – that
inflation would be persistent and that rates would have to be higher for longer. And if you go back to a year ago in
September, when we exited indirect auto $3.3 billion portfolio that was an area that we thought and I still believe
we'll be under intense stress in the market that we're entering.
The other thing that I always look for is any place that there's leverage and Gerard Cassidy had just asked a
question about leverage loans. That's an area that we pay a lot of attention to. Another area that we pay a lot of
attention to is just real estate broadly. And by strategy, we're focused on apartments, multifamily and industrial.
Interestingly, those values were up significantly from pre-pandemic levels, 15% and 39%, respectively. The other
area where I think that there's going to be a lot of dislocation is in office, particularly B and C class office because
those buildings are leveraged and obviously, people have changed the way they work. That's not a business that
we're in, in any significant way, although we do have a $600 billion third-party commercial loan servicing portfolio,
which is debt that's off us.
And now the second largest category below retail where you would expect that's starting to go into active special
servicing are these B and C class offices in central business districts. Those are a few of the places that I'd bring
to your attention.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just on the office, do you think it's a cliff event just given the nature of the leases? Or is it going to be more
like what we've seen with big box retail malls where it's played out over the last decade, as opposed to in any
given quarter or any given year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Yeah, I don't think it's a cliff event. I think it's a slow burn, because if you think about these B and C class office
space, they have many, many tenants with varying termination dates on their leases. I think it will be a slow, but
consistent burn.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Chris, I was hoping you could sort of walk through
the investment banking pipelines and pull-through. I think we can all see what's happening in the industry. But
some companies are noting that there's still enough activity taking place at sort of the smaller segment, middle
market and below that it's keeping sort of activity going enough to prop up numbers.
So where are you seeing healthier activity versus what's still slow? And just given your background, do you think
there's a point where we will say get price discovery and then increased activity despite higher rates and a weaker
economic backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
So I do. So where the activity has remained strong, and we had a very good quarter in this area, it is areas like
syndicated finance. So that area continues to be strong. The areas that are really challenged are – is the public
equity market.
And that's a market – unlike the debt market where it's binary, either you can issue equity or you can't basically.
And right now, you clearly can't. The M&A markets, I'm confident will come back. We are involved in a lot of these
strategic discussions.
And what's happening, Scott is if you're a buyer, you basically have sort of a free option. There's no huge impetus
to close. Everyone is looking out over the horizon and predicting a downturn. And so if you have a deal locked up,
you sort of drag your feet and wait and see what the downturn is going to look like.
Our pipelines remain strong in that business. We continue to selectively hire people. It will come back. I don't think
it's going to come back. I don't see any significant market change in the fourth quarter, by the way, but I do think
the business will come back.
Having said that, I've been doing this for a long time, there's an inverse relationship between the amount of time
you've been working on the deal and the probability that it's actually going to close. And so I throw that out as a
watch point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect, okay. That's good color. Thank you. And then maybe, Don, this notion of AOCI marks and the tangible
book and TCE hits has gotten a lot more attention. A lot of companies have begun to move pretty substantial
amounts of their securities portfolios to held to maturity.
So in a sense, you can sort of make the TCE tangible book issue go away with the wave of hand, so to speak. So
maybe just some thoughts on why you guys are keeping mostly available for sale. To what degree does TCE
matter in your eyes? Does it govern any of your capital management thinking or things like that?

Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Sure that as we look at our future security purchases, we're starting to put a portion of those into held to maturity,
whereas it used to be primarily only into the available for sale. And so we're just separating some where we might
want to have bullet maturities where we can do some end of life type of swaps attached to it that we need to keep
those and available for sale as opposed to move them into held to maturity.
The TCE ratio isn't a high priority for us. Our main capital ratio that we focus on is the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio
and some of the other regulatory ratios whether it's Tier 1 or total. And so that's why you saw us take action in the
third quarter with a preferred stock issuance and also a sub debt issuance. And we feel very good about how
we're positioned across that capital spectrum.
The other thing to think about, too, as far as the TCE ratio. If you would just back out the AOCI impact for TCE,
that would take our ratio up by 330 basis points. And so on that adjusted basis, which will all come back over time
because we don't have risk of those investments not being paid off because they're all agencies or US treasuries.
We're going to see that realized. And so that's more of the area of focus for us as well.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just wondering what you're seeing in loan pricing trends, specifically in commercial. Obviously,
the absolute yield is going up because of higher rates. But are you seeing any improvement in spreads given we
see widening in the marketplace in public markets that is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
That's a great question, Matt. And what's ironic about this is, to-date, what we've seen is credit spreads widen out
for the investment grade companies that we serve. And because they're seeing that in the capital markets for the
middle market space because of the competition there tends to be more local.
We haven't seen the commercial spreads widen that much yet. We would expect that to pick up over time here,
but near term, the spreads are holding in but not expanding on the commercial for the lower middle market
customers.

Operator: Next, we have a question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I've one negative, one positive. The negative is the personnel expense up so much quarter-to-quarter, and I
get one-time items, 8% just versus – it's just how the one-time items seem to repeat and therefore, maybe they
aren't so one-time. I mean, I guess you said fourth quarter you might have some more. Next year, do you expect
more one-time items? Or when do we get more core expense numbers because that seemed to come in a little
higher than expected.
And on the positive side, as far as your outlook for NII and the NIM, I mean, your NIM of 2.7% a decade ago, it
was close to 3.7%. Conceptually, we've had almost 14 years of zero interest rates and now that we're getting out
of that, could you potentially get all the way back to 3.7%? Or what are some of the ins and outs since the global
financial crisis that could help or hurt that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Sure. As far as personnel, a couple of things that we've talked about as being one-time or just different, one is the
pension settlement loss that we'll have in the fourth quarter. The good thing there is, is that with rates being
higher, the threshold is higher for us to be in a position to have to realize losses in the future.
And so we do think this truly is more one-time. And as long as rates remain where they're at or even go a little
higher, we shouldn't see that come through as far as a charge. The one thing that you will see, Mike, is that a
good portion of our long-term incentive compensation is tied to our stock price.
And we want our employees to be shareholders and have a consistent objective to what our shareholders have
as well and so part of that incentive compensation expense does fluctuate from time-to-time with our share price.
And so our expectation and hope is that we'll see our share price increase. And so from that, you will see the
incentive compensation expense increase with that as well.
Beyond that, Mike, that I would say for the current quarter versus a year ago, as I mentioned before, the core
salary line item is up about 10%, with about 5% of that coming from head count-related increases.
Some of that from acquisitions we've done. And we had about a 4% kind of merit increase impact to that as well
throughout the year, and that reflects some of the experience we had for rightsizing the lower salaries, but also
19


KeyCorp
(KEY) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
the market pressure that we're seeing. And so near-term, I think we'll probably see a little higher than our typical
2% as far as wage inflation going forward.
But I think we'll see that settle down and as Chris has said, that we'll continue to make investments in talent and
especially in our frontline bankers and also in the technology space to continue to grow our business. But with
that, we'll be holding the people account while they're making sure that we're getting the appropriate returns on
those investments and showing the growth going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Yeah. Don, the only thing I would add to that is, on the technology front, there has been a transition as we think
about full stack engineers from subcontract labor to people that are part of our head count. We just think it's
important as we continue to become the digital bank that we are that we control that talent. And so that's a piece
of what you're seeing there, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Yeah. And then Mike, as far as the margin expansion, I don't want people to start thinking that we're going to be
at a 3.7% margin, because our risk profile is much different than what it was historically. And so it is relationship
based, but we do see significant growth from that.
And so one and just a simple math for that would be taking a look at our full year net interest income and if you
just layered on top of that, the $1.2 billion that we've talked about the repricing of the swaps and the treasuries
that clearly gets you into the mid-3s and maybe not to the 3.7% range, but we would see some meaningful lift
from here if the rates play out with this kind of environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just one follow-up on that comment about technology. So, less consultants and more full-time tech
employees so that you can better control your tech destiny, is that the idea of this? And what was the tipping point
for that change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
The tipping point was, as we were in the pandemic and everybody was short on talent, we were getting more
turnover from some of our contractors than frankly we wanted to get. And we wanted to be able to literally have
the continuity, and we wanted to drive our strategy in a consistent way with leadership.
And so we made the decision in certain areas to dial back contract labor and to hire in. When I say it's full stack
engineers, and the nice thing is with some of the acquisitions we've made, Mike, we have the kind of leaders that
can attract the kind of people onto our platform that we want as we go to the next level.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks a lot. Good morning. Don, just one more follow-up on the balance sheet mix. So the securities portfolio
has been hanging around $50 billion and just want to understand with that plan run off in that good slide you have
in the back about the maturities. Do you expect to keep the securities portfolio around this size from here and
then just on trying to understand how that that gets funded incrementally given that you're still expecting decent
loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Yeah. There's really two pieces of our investment portfolio. One is the core book, which is about $40 billion, and
the other is the US treasuries, which are about $9 billion. I think near-term, and our outlook would suggest that we
think that core portfolio will hang in there around the $40 billion level.
And so we think that's appropriate just from a liquidity perspective and a balance sheet mix. For the US treasury
portion of the portfolio, we'll make some assessments as that maturities – or those maturities come through. And
we'll get the benefit whether we use that for future funding or we just go ahead and roll that into the core portfolio.
And so yet to be determined how that plays out, but I would say that there's probably less certainty on that $9
billion short-term treasury portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And just following on to that then. So the $1.2 billion benefit would – does that in contemplate like any type of
delta in sizing of both the securities book and the overall swaps book as you get to those out years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
The swap book assumes that it would stay the same. And then on the treasury portfolio, it has either the assumed
impact of rolling that over into more one year treasuries or using that for funding and it's the same net bottom line
impact at this point in time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just – sorry, one more follow-up. Just, do you have an understanding or can you help us
understand just when the near-term swaps detriment just from the natural higher rates kind of gets to its bottom
21

and then you start to get this that incremental benefit rate of change starts to happen? I guess it sounds like that's
in next year, but do you have an understanding of kind of when that pivot happens?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
I would say that a couple of things we have to know for that. When do short-term rates peak because that's going
to be the main driver as to when that negative impact happens for the existing portfolio? And then as we have the
rollovers of that book, we'll be picking up over 300 basis points on the swaps as they would rollover. And so that
will help offset that, but it probably sometime in 2023 that we start to see that peak and move the other direction.

Good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

A couple of questions. One, I just wanted to understand what kind of loan growth you've got baked into your
outlook? And what is your expectation for how you're going to fund that loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
So what we – on the loan growth front, we would not see the same trajectory of loan growth that we've
experienced in the last couple of quarters. Our guidance for Q4 is 2% to 4%, Betsy. And we've had a lot of lift on
the consumer side over the last several quarters. I don't see the same level of lift that. So I think you're going to
see – we haven't given guidance yet for 2023. But with respect to loan growth, we're targeting 2% to 4% in the
fourth quarter.

And just to fund that our guidance for the fourth quarter is also 1% to 3% increase in our deposits. And if you go
through the math, it's a pretty close match there as far as the midpoints of both are around that $3 billion kind of
range.
And so it's we think we'll be fairly close to funding that through just the core balance sheet growth. We have used
other wholesale funding to help fill that gap in the last couple of quarters but expect it to be more core going
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And if the deposits don't come through for whatever reason, can you just give us your hierarchy of how you would
go about funding it? Is it securities roll off or you first go to the wholesale funding piece?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Near-term, we've been using FHLB advances and locking those into set maturities or term maturities. So we
would probably continue that. And then, as I mentioned before, we're still yet undecided as far as the roll off of the
US treasuries when they start coming through next year and then 2024 is to how we use those proceeds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just lastly, I know the forward curve is looking for the Fed to be done in early 2023. But if they end up
extending with the rate hike cycle going further into 2023. How should we expect that impacts the outlook here?
I know you mentioned that you've got the benefit of the short-term of the swaps rolling off which should help. But
I'm just wondering is there any timing that we should be considering here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Yeah, I don't think there's any cliff or any events there that we still view the rates going up, we'll still have a net
positive even with deposit betas being higher than what they've been before. And then just the repricing of the
swaps and the treasuries will be additive for us. And so we think that we still will be able to grow net interest
income and margin throughout the next couple of years even if rates do go beyond the current outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just last question, going back to the quarter in mortgage for the quarter, very strong results
here with – I just wanted to understand what the main driver of that was and the tail, the legs on that type of
increase? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure. So for us, it was driven really by the purchase, 87% of our originations were purchased. And this is a
relationship-based business, 30% were medical professionals. So ours will basically refinance business, Betsy,

has completely dried up. I would envision from here that purchased mortgage continues to decline in this
environment as we believe we're in for a cycle that's higher for longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So this is reflecting loans that had probably started a quarter or two ago, so we should expect that should
tail off. And are these 30-year fixed you're putting on or 15-year or ARM floaters. Can you give us a sense of the
construct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
It tends to be more ARMs in 15 year. We do have some 30-year fixed in some of our doctor dentist program that
we've had. But I'd say it's a mix of those. And we would expect to see the fourth quarter origination levels be lower
than what the third quarter was. It still is a core product for us and something that we had underweighted in the
past. So we still think there is room for some modest growth in the balance sheet there.

Hi.

Bill Carcache Q

I wanted to follow up on your comments around the modest increase in the reserve rate due to the economic
outlook. Can you give a little bit more detail on what kind of unemployment assumption is implicit in that reserve
and what you'd expect the reserve rate to go to if unemployment were to increase to, say, the 5% to 5.5% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Yeah. As far as what we use as our baseline for our CECL reserves, we tend to start with the consensus
assessments for Moody's. And so we did see a shift in that from last year to this year. I would say that Moody's
unemployment levels are using about a 4% unemployment level for 2023. And I don't know that off the top of my
24

head what the impact would be of seeing that going to 5% because we'd have to have the other components of
the economic outlook.
But I would say that if we look at where our reserves were back at January 1, 2020, I would say that the
unemployment levels and economic outlook was a little worse than what we're seeing now today, and our reserve
levels there were about 10 or 15 basis points higher than what they are today for us. So it's a lot of moving parts
and pieces, but I think that it's not going to be a huge change, but still would be reflective in our reserves.

That's helpful. Thank you. And separately, it seems intuitive that the cohort that you're targeting with your Laurel
Road products would perform relatively well in a downturn. But is there less credit history for this asset class? And
if so, can you give a little bit of color on the kind of data and analytics that you're using to underwrite potential
customers. And what's the approval rate of customers seeking a loan through Laurel Road and actually – those
that actually receive one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
I would say that we do have data for doctors and dentists programs, both on the residential mortgage side and
also for student loans. That history is continuing to be built out. We are using that insight in order to inform our
credit underwriting decision. I don't have the exact approval rate for loans, but you would probably assume that
it's fairly high given the nature of the doctor that we're approaching who is going from, say, $80,000 a year in
compensation to $300,000-plus and has a firm commitment and a new assignment with a large hospital. So it's – I
would assume that it could be a fairly high approval rate.
