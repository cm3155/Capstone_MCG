Jennifer Ann Thompson
Executive Vice President, Director-Investor Relations and Economic Analysis, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Erica, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and
CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer.
During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide
presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at
usbank.com.
I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page
2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I'll now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry
and I will take any questions you have.
I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.30 and generated total revenue of
$5.9 billion. Our linked-quarter pre-tax preprovision net revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by continued
momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances and continued focus on expense
management, resulting in positive operating leverage. We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter,
supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics.
Turning to capital. Our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30, which was 1.5% higher than June
30. Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30.
Slide 4 provides key third quarter performance metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of over 20%.
Slide 5 highlights strong trends in digital engagement.

On slide 6, we are providing initial information about our Business Banking and payment relationships, which we
plan to update every quarter. Our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides
a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities.
Over the next few years, we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this
ecosystem. Our starting point is that we have about 1.1 million Business Banking relationships, which we define
as businesses with under $25 million in revenue. Currently, about half of our payments customers of this size
have a Business Banking product, and just under one-third of our Business Banking customers have a payments
product.
The opportunity is to both increase the number of Business Banking relationships and to deepen these
relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments products and services and connecting our
payments customers with our banking products and services.
As we discussed previously, we believe we can grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related
revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.
Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter
earnings trends. Average loans increased 0.8% compared with the second quarter, driven by growth in other retail
loans, primarily installment loans as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages.
This growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances, which was impacted by lower levels of PPP
loans. At September 30, PPP loan balances totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion at June 30. Excluding
PPP loans, third quarter average loans grew by 1.8% on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning to slide 8, average deposits increased 0.5% compared with the second quarter and 6.4% compared with
a year ago. On both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, we continue to benefit from favorable mix shift as
average noninterest-bearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined.
Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. Nonperforming assets declined on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year
basis and our net charge-off ratio hit a record low of 20 basis points. Our reserve release was $310 million this
quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics.
Our allowance for credit losses, as of September 30, totaled $6.3 billion or 2.1% of loans. The allowance level
reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios.
Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter of 2021, we earned $1.30 per diluted share. These
results include a reserve release of $310 million.
Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased by 1.0%
compared with the second quarter. The growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the
Paycheck Protection Program.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Excluding PPP-related fees, net interest income would have been stable, reflecting lower loan yields and the
impact of changing loan mix, offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth, lower premium amortization and
an additional day in the quarter. Our net interest margin was stable compared with the second quarter.
Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income declined 0.7% as
decreases in mortgage revenue and commercial products revenue more than offset strong growth in payments
revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury management fees.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased 2.8%, reflecting higher than expected payments revenue
and a 20% increase in mortgage revenue, driven by growth in production volume and related gain on sale
margins as well as higher loan sales.
Slide 13 provides information on our payment services business. Our payments business continues to benefit
from improving economic conditions and spend activity. In the third quarter, sales volumes for both our credit card
and our merchant processing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in 2019, while CPS volume
was about in line.
As expected, prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of government-related stimulus
continues to diminish. The reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on
a linked-quarter basis.
However, corporate payment revenues increased by 13%, which was better than expected, driven by improving
business spend activity. Merchant processing revenue increased by 4.8% due to higher merchant and equipment
fees as well as higher sales volumes.
Turning to slide 14, noninterest expense increased 1.2% compared to the second quarter. This increase primarily
reflected higher revenue-related compensation and performance-based incentives.
Slide 15 highlights our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 10.2%,
which increased slightly compared to June 30. At the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share
buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire MUFG's Union Bank (sic)
[MUFG Union Bank].
We expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of 2022. After the closing
of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%.
I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. As PPP winds down and we approach the end of the
forgiveness period, we expect PPP fees to decline $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter compared with
the third quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP fees, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be
relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. We expect PPP to be immaterial to both net interest income and the
net interest margin in 2022.
In the fourth quarter, we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen, driven by improving
sales volumes. However, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter, which affects
linked-quarter comparisons. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax-
advantaged investments of approximately $60 million as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and
business investments.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than
normal. For the full year of 2021, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. To summarize, our third quarter results were positive on several fronts, highlighted by a solid
growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum and strong credit quality. We are finishing off the year in a
strong position heading into 2022. And we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across
the franchise, supported by our continued investment in people, digital, technology and data analytics.
Our three payments businesses will continue to benefit from the improved spend activity, particularly as consumer
and business travel recovers towards pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we believe our secular growth
initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over
the immediate and longer term.
Our Business Banking initiatives are still in the early innings, but we're gaining traction. And our partnership with
State Farm continues to evolve and grow. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing.
Aside from our organic growth opportunities, our recently announced acquisition of Union Bank provides a
platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network in demographically attractive West Coast
markets and leverage our broad product set and leading digital capabilities across a loyal but underpenetrated
customer base.
All of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, and continue to deliver the industry-leading
returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all
they've done throughout the year.
We'll now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Andy; and good morning, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Andy, slide 6 is very interesting. And as you pointed out, it's a new slide. Two questions on this slide. You talked
about the growth that you are anticipating in that Business Banking area to get the customers that are Business
Banking-only to be both banking and payments. What percentage – can you get it to that 50% that you have on
the other circle with the payments area? Can you get it to that area? And how long would it take you to get there?
And second, if you put in the Union Bank customers, how large will that 1.1 million grow to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Gerard, Union Bank has about 190,000 comparable customers, so that would be added to the 1.1 million. And
I do believe we can get to your first question that left-hand side to the 50-50 at least. Again, the way we're thinking
about this product set is really a combination, a dashboard, if you will, that helps these customers manage their
business payables, receivables, travel activity, payroll and so forth in one comprehensive viewpoint. And I think
that will allow us to both deepen the relationships as well as expand. So I do believe we can give that 50-50 as
well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, as a follow-up, you guys are obviously well regarded on your credit through the full cycle.
And you pointed out, Terry, that I think the 20 basis points is a record low in net charge-offs. What do you
anticipate – when will things normalize? And I hate that word because there's no such thing as normal credit
charge-offs. But it seems like – how sustainable are these record low levels do you think as we look out over the
next 12 to 24 months?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Yeah. It's a great question. And your point about it really being difficult to predict is right on. When we end up
looking at and kind of looking at forecast, et cetera, we do expect it's probably going to stay at these lower levels
for a few quarters, and that's going to start to normalize. Probably it doesn't get back there until what we would
define as normal, which is kind of that 45 basis points to 50 basis points overall until at least the end of 2022 and
probably sometime in 2023. But it is very hard to predict.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

Yeah. No, I agree. Thank you, gentlemen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. One was on just loan growth in general. And I wanted to
understand where you see some signs of life that might be accelerating as we move into 4Q and into next year? I
ask because I saw a nice uptick in the consumer side, but commercial seemed to be a little bit weaker. I'm
wondering if – what you're seeing there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So when we end up looking – first of all, maybe the fourth quarter, we would expect probably modest
growth going into the fourth quarter on a linked-quarter basis. And if you just look at the puts and takes, and I
think that this will play out over time as well, but the puts and takes, at least, in the near term is that we would
continue to expect to see reasonably good growth in our auto lending business, which has been very strong of
late.
And we would also expect that our credit card balances would start to strengthen. And a big part of that is both
consumer spend, but we've also been investing in terms of account growth and various sort of promotional
activities. So that will help to drive it.
And then, as government stimulus kind of starts to dissipate, which has, I think, been slowly doing, we do expect
that that payment rate will start to come down. It's really kind of at a historic high right now. And as that comes
down, credit card balances should strengthen. So certainly, on the consumer side, we expect growth in the near
term.
The C&I, as you said, is a little more challenging. And the principal challenge there is that we continue to see a
fair amount of payoffs. And then PPP forgiveness is also dampening the C&I growth in that particular space.
8


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Where we are seeing nice areas of opportunity in C&I is in asset-backed securitization type of lending, mortgage
warehouse lines, some supply chain finance activities. Those are all areas that have been of particular strength.
When we end up looking at middle market space, we're seeing lots of confidence in terms of customers and
relatively strong pipelines. And so we do expect that that is an area of opportunity once we get beyond the drag of
PPP. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective in terms of some of the puts and takes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And the PPP in the fourth quarter, I think you indicated it would be down, obviously, Q-on-Q. But is it sizable in
the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. It ends up coming down, and you saw we talked a little bit about the decline this quarter. I think it's going to
come down probably half of that again in the fourth quarter. And then, it's hard to tell in terms of does it stabilize at
that level or does it come down a little bit further. But our expectation, at least, right now, Betsy, is that by the end
of the fourth quarter, the vast majority of PPP has been forgiven. And the impact to, for example, balances and
net interest income and margin will be really immaterial when we think about 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And in the fourth quarter – the PPP contribution to NII in the fourth quarter, how would you size that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
I think it's modest, Betsy. The peak quarter certainly was the third quarter. It becomes very modest in the fourth
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. And then, just lastly, as you think about the forward look here on integrating MUFG USA Union
Bank into your operation, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of the efficiencies here? Because when
you announced that deal and we had that conference call, we obviously heard a lot about the cost saves that
you're anticipating getting from the MUFG USA side. But I'm wondering, is there a tech angle as well on your
legacy platform that will also be enhanced, this one plus one equal 2.5, for example?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So I think just to remind you of the timeframes, we did actually submit our application for the transaction on
October 6. So that is in – our expectation is a close sometime late first quarter, early second quarter with a
conversion integration in the third – into the fourth quarter of 2022. As we talked about on that call, we would
expect about 75% of the savings, the efficiencies to occur in that first year 2023.
And as we also talked about, Betsy, the real benefit here is we have the platform, and it's a lift and shift from what
they do to our platform, which allows for the majority of the cost savings. And the second enhancement on that is,
9


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
our platform has more capabilities, and in my view, it has more opportunities, a better customer experience and
more products and services. So there's also a revenue component as well. So in that line, in that view, yes, it is
more than just one plus one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, John.

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. I want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on the trends you're seeing in your payments
business. I know you had mentioned the increased spend activity. Wanted to see if you can give us a little bit
more color on how that breaks out.
And then separately, maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on what your 2022 expectation is at this time based
upon the trends you're beginning to see in the payments side. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe let me take the first part, and then Andy can pipe in with respect to what we're seeing as we go
into 2022. So maybe as a comparable [ph] period versus 2019 (00:20:53), first of all, as we said, the merchant
and the card business is now above 2019 levels. In the third quarter, sales were about almost 5% higher than
2019 in terms of merchant processing. And if you end up looking at credit, debit card, a 20-plus-percent above
where it was in 2019. So those have made really nice recoveries.
I'd also keep in mind is that when you end up looking at a merchant as an example, airline, travel and
entertainment is still down quite a bit. And probably, I would say, flattened a bit in the third quarter simply because
of the delta variant. But as we think about going forward and as the delta variant subsides a bit, we would expect
that to start to accelerate again.
If you end up looking at the card business, as I said, credit card and debit card business, the sales volumes have
been quite strong relative to 2019, and that's driven by consumer spend. The one thing that will end up impacting
10


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
card revenue is the fact that prepaid continues to come down as government stimulus dissipates. But by the end
of the year, going into 2022, again, the quarter-over-quarter impact will be relatively immaterial.
And then, the last thing I would just talk about is on the corporate payments side of the equation, it's pretty much
at 2019 levels, but the travel and entertainment or the T&E spend is still about 50% to 55% below 2019. And we
would expect that to continue to normalize. So we think that there's opportunity still there for that to continue to
strengthen. We have seen, what I would say, other commercial spend strengthening quarter-over-quarter, and we
would expect that to continue as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that's exactly right, Terry. And just to summarize what Terry said, ex-travel, airlines and entertainment
activity, spend is up versus pre-pandemic levels in that 20% range or so. And I would expect that to continue to
increase into 2022. I think the real opportunity is in that travel category, which as Terry mentioned, if you think
about merchant or car, whatever category you look at, is down in that 35%, 40% range. As that recovers, that's
where a lot of opportunity exists as well as what Terry mentioned in the corporate travel and entertainment, which
is down closer to 50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, I know you mentioned on the expense side, some marketing and business
investments, at least for the fourth quarter. Is there anything there that is going to carry through into 2022 as
you're putting money into the business? I know you recently launched the Buy Now Pay Later product. So just
curious if there's ongoing marketing and business investment that we should consider as we dial in expense
expectations for 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think as we think about 2022, the level of investment probably doesn't go up significantly from here.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just wanted a one follow-up with you on – comments around loan growth. Specifically, if you can
address two things. One, just the outlook for CRE lending as you think about next year, given potential disruption
from the just change in work from home, et cetera, how you're approaching CRE lending.
And on the consumer side, do you expect – do we need to see a big drawdown in the US savings rate before you
actually see consumer lending pick up substantially? Or as you pointed out, the government stimulus programs
fading away are enough to see some legs to that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe to the first question with respect to CRE, we actually saw some growth on a linked-quarter basis
in CRE this quarter. The project level, pipelines, things like that are reasonably strong. As we think about the next
couple of quarters, though, I think what we are seeing in the marketplace is pretty strong competition. And so we'll
have to watch and see what happens with respect to paydowns.
Regarding return to office and some of those impacts, when we end up looking at it maybe in terms of the areas
to watch, I think that as return to office occurs, we are starting to see collateral valuations improving. And we're
starting to see some of those trends improving as well. And I think that that generally would be a positive thing in
terms of CRE investment by underlying developers and financiers. But I think that for right now, we're just
watching what sort of paydown levels occur because of competition.
And then, on the consumer side of the equation, I mean, we're actually seeing – we do expect that credit card
balances from here start to grow and possibly accelerate as we get into 2022. When you think about customers
that are revolving type of customers, I believe that with government stimulus starting to dissipate that they are
going to be looking to credit products in terms of being able to support their consumer spend. And we've
continued to see relatively strong growth in auto lending. And I would anticipate that will continue depending upon
supply chain impacts associated with chips and things like that. But overall, we're fairly bullish on consumer
lending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful color. Thank you. And just on a separate note, in terms of when you look at the stickiness of the
deposit growth that we've seen over the last 18 months, if you could just talk to your outlook in terms of whether
you expect deposit balances to continue to grow. And do you at any point as you look forward in the next year or
two expect deposit growth to actually turn negative in any meaningful way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Our deposit growth has been reasonably strong. But particularly, if you peel back the onion, it's been
particularly strong in the Consumer and Business Banking areas with year-over-year growth of about 16% linked-
quarter growth at about 1% in the third quarter. So, I would fully expect that a lot of that will stick, depending upon,
obviously, the excess savings rate that we talked about. We're also seeing growth in the Wealth Management
businesses. And we would expect that a fair amount of that would stick as well.
12


U.S. Bancorp

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
So as we think about deposits, we think we have been growing what I would call the core balances quite a bit. As
liquidity does come out of the system, though, I would expect that we would see some runoff, or where investors
start to utilize those deposits to invest in like CDO, CLO sort of structure. So within our Wealth
Management/Investment Services business, we would expect to see some runoff.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. I was hoping, Terry, you might be able to address the durability of mortgage revenues at the current level. I
thought it was a pretty solid quarter, a little better than I had anticipated. I'm just hoping you can address some of
the puts and takes given margin origination levels and just overall durability of this quarter's level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Great question. Obviously, in the third quarter, we saw a little bit of an uptick with respect to applications
because of refinancing activities when interest rates came down. I would say, Scott, that over the course of the
last several years, we've been making a significant amount of investment in a couple of different things. One is a
strong focus on purchase money area. And a fairly significant amount of our volume is on the purchase money
side. So, home sales, to the extent that continues to grow, should allow us to hold up really well.
And the second thing is that we've invested a lot in the retail channel and our digital capabilities. And we're taking
nice market share in the mortgage banking space. So while mortgage banking revenue will trend in the same sort
of way as the industry, I think that we do have the opportunity to be able to outperform the industry.

Andy, what would you add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Agree.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then, I was hoping for maybe a little more color on expenses, particularly that
comment you made earlier about the $60 million seasonal increase in amortization of tax-advantaged in the fourth
quarter. Does that go up and then come all the way back down? Or is there sort of a headwind that emerges in
2022? And then presumably, it's a wash from an earnings standpoint given a corresponding tax impact? How
should we be thinking about as we go through the fourth quarter? And then [ph] – thank you (00:31:02).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Great question. So, what ends up happening in that particular space is about 60% of the overall production
for the year happens in the fourth quarter. And so if you look historically, we always see a blip in the fourth quarter
and then it comes back down in the first quarter. And then, it slowly builds, and then we see another blip in the
fourth quarter of the following year. So, it's usually – it's a seasonal thing in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Good. Thank you very much.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks a lot. Hey. Good morning, guys. Terry, can you just make sure we understand the offset to that $60
million in expenses, where we see that in the income statement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Where that ends up flowing through is in the tax rate. And usually, what that ends up happening is on a lag
basis. So, you'll start to see the tax rate improving in 2022 as a result of the investments we're making today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. Okay. And in the fourth quarter, do you see that offset to the $60 million in the tax rate as well?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp

Ken Usdin Q

It's more of a forward...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, it's really more forward-looking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. Thank you. Secondly, you mentioned in the press release that fee waivers were down a little bit. Can
you give us an update on what they were in the quarter and also what you need from rates to get rid of the fee
waivers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So they were about just about $70 million in the third quarter, down just a couple of million dollars versus the
second quarter, principally due to the repo rate. We get about 50% of it back with the first 25 basis points and
about 95% of it back with the second 25 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then, just last one. In terms of the payments businesses again, like so on merchant, when we
see growth in – can you just compare and contrast when we see growth in the volumes, I know it's mix
dependent, but just with your mix of business, what's the correlation between increases and improvements in
merchant vis-à-vis the improvements that we see in the sales volumes? Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Typically, what's happening right now is a mix change. So what's coming back are some of the areas they have a
little thinner margin, which is what's causing the differential on sales being up about 5% and fees being down
about 5%. And so that's partly – and this is – I'm using these numbers versus 2019. And if you look at it versus
2020, sales were up about 30% and fees are up about 13%. So there'll be a bit of a gap there, partly because of
the mix of what's coming back. And as we look forward, I would expect a bit of a differential, revenue growth being
slightly below sales growth on a go-forward basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Sorry. Can I ask just one more? I forgot to ask about the expense you had on the airline and travel. Was
that a onetime update? And was that meaningful? Can you tell us how much that was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A

Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you guys give us an update on your rate sensitivity, the flexibility to add securities or swaps
and how the UB deal might impact that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe just the last question first. The Union Bank is a little bit more asset-sensitive than we are. And
we would expect that they would probably add to our asset sensitivity in that 30 basis points to 40 basis points
range. Where we're at today, if you end up looking at first – second quarter, we are at about 2.8% asset-sensitive
to a 50-basis-point shock. We've been expanding that, Matt, in a couple of different ways. We've been holding
more cash, looking for a better investment entry point. And so that asset sensitivity has been coming up.
And in addition to that, we have been just looking at different hedge strategies that have been expanding our
asset sensitivity as well. So today, it's probably about 3.5% kind of asset sensitivity, and that's the position that
we're at right now. We do have the opportunity – and we have the expectation that rates are going to start moving
up at least on the long end. And so we're trying to be patient and be in a position to be opportunistic when rates
are in the right spot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just separately, a clarification question on payments. When you talk about the
seasonality in 4Q, maybe remind us what that is, and I guess, I was thinking it's on the corporate payment side,
which may not be as seasonal this year as normal. But just elaborate on that. And I'm digging in just because last
quarter, you said you thought payments would be flat and ends up being a little bit better than expected, and it
seems like it might be a conservative guide again for 4Q. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. Usually, merchant is flat to down a little bit. So it's seasonally affected in the fourth quarter. Card actually
performs a little bit better in the fourth quarter because of holiday sales. But CPS is the business that ends up
coming down because you have a significant amount of government spend in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
We got our new slide, the slide 6, talking about combining banking with payments. But if you could just elaborate
a little bit more – I think I heard you say what are we looking at? We're looking at 28% of banking customers –
what are we looking at? It's a lot of banking customers don't use payments is the bottom line. And you want to get
them to use it.
And half of your payments customers don't use banking services. You want them to use that, too. And I think you
said you seek to grow the small business relationship by 15% to 20% and related revenues by 25% to 30%. Over
what timeframe is that? And how are you going to do that? And when are you rolling out some of the new
products that are going to help enable that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. First, you got the numbers correct. Second, this starts at 1.1 million customers. We have about
another 190,000 that would be added with Union Bank. The timeframe is the next few years. We'll continue to add
to this slide to give you more specifics, including the progress on these numbers as well as the thinking about
revenue.
The way we're going to do this is by a combined dashboard and product offering. That has both payments and
banking on that dashboard to help those businesses run their company, payables, receivables, travel, payroll as
well as banking products and services. We have been rolling out that dashboard, making enhancement to it as we
speak, and we'll continue to do it each and every month, each and every quarter. And that's the way we think
about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So I guess, how do you think about the profit margins on these relationships? It seems like we provide
more one-stop shopping. It should be better service for the customer, and you should be making more on that, so
not just the revenues. What would you expect the earnings to increase by? I assume more than the 25% to 30%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes, I was quoting a revenue number. I would expect the earnings to be higher than that because the marginal
cost of many of these products and services is not as high because they go on the platforms we already have
established.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, lastly, since we're on the topic of tech. It's been six years since U.S. Bancorp has shown positive
operating leverage. You have two quarters in a row. It looks like – maybe on a linked-quarter basis you showed it.
Maybe you won't show that in the fourth quarter. You didn't talk about linked-quarter operating leverage. But can
you commit to 2022 having positive operating leverage? I guess, there'll be some noise with Union. But are you
on that trajectory now? And if so, why?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, there will be some noise with Union, as you mentioned. It's always our goal. We've made a lot of
investments in the company, and those investments are going to do two things. They're going to drive revenue
growth. And they're going to also create more efficiencies in terms of our operations and the tech stack
modernization, in particular, creates a less expensive operating environment. So I think those are all positives. As
we look into 2022, that's always our objective. 2022 will depend a bit upon the yield curve and what happens with
rates, but that's our objective.

the outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Our expectation, again, is that when we think about longer-term rates, we do expect them to be moving up
given the inflationary pressures and other things that are kind of – just in terms of economic growth. So we have
19


U.S. Bancorp

been holding off with respect to reinvestment of maturities and things like that and building cash balances to
improve our asset sensitivity. And we'll look for opportunities to reinvest that in the future as rates start to move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. Another one, different topic. Did I hear you say that you expect revenue growth in payments fees
to be better than sales trends? And if so, can you elaborate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Vivek, the other way around. So, the sales number will be a bit higher than the revenue growth, partly because of
mix, partly because of the investments we're making. So for example, on card, as we have the sales growth
occurring, some of the investments in new business generation comes through and impacts the revenue growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the relatively softer commercial loan growth that you guys are seeing. Are
you hearing anything from your commercial customers that suggest that the depressed line utilization rates are
really just an extension of the supply chain problems that they're having? And if so, does that suggest that line
utilization is unlikely to improve until the supply chain problems are resolved? Any color you can give on that
would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. Obviously, the supply chain is impacting customers in terms of their ability to be able to offer products and
services, et cetera. But it hasn't necessarily come up in topic conversation with them. Certainly, I do think that as
supply chain challenges start to resolve themselves that that will create opportunity for us in terms of line
20

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
utilization and bank financing. But it's not something that has been discussed a lot with clients, let's put it that way,
or that they brought up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's helpful. Separately, on the merchant acquiring business, the Elavon business certainly puts
you guys in a unique position to be able to turn on Buy Now Pay Later solutions for your merchant partners in a
way that other banks can't. Can you discuss whether you're considering offering Buy Now Pay Later solutions to
your merchant customers?
And separately and, I guess, a broader question. How do you guys think about BNPL? Does it pose
disintermediation risk to your card business? Or is that BNPL customer really more likely someone who typically
would not even qualify for a credit card? And so, BNPL is essentially just something that they're using that –
allows them to turn their debit card into a credit card and it also helps merchants drive incremental sales? Any
thoughts around how you guys are thinking about it and the opportunity, if you see one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Bill. So, I think it's a little of both of the topics you brought – both of the ways you described it. So, first of
all, we have a number of test cases going on. We already offer Buy Now Pay Later on our credit card offering.
Sometimes a customer wants to have a large purchase specific from a payment plan, and that could be a current
credit card customer choosing to have a very planned set of payments going forward.
At other times, Buy Now Pay Later can allow for a customer who would otherwise not have a credit card to
acquire or purchase something using the Buy Now Pay Later capability. And in that sense, you do partner with the
merchants to increase the sales base of that merchant portfolio. So, we're working on all those fronts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And my other questions have been largely addressed, but if I could squeeze in one last one on a separate
topic. You guys recently announced that you'll be providing cryptocurrency custody services for your institutional
clients. Could you frame the revenue opportunity there?
And some large banks' CEOs have indicated that they can't provide cryptocurrency custody services. But it would
be great, Andy, if you could discuss what's different in the way that USB is thinking about providing custody and
what gives you guys comfort doing that at a time when there's still some controversy and, I guess, unwillingness
among some large players around providing those services.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, let me step back. Our institutional investors are looking to participate in the digital currency market as
an investment class. We have a large fund services business that provides fund services, transfer agency and
fund administration to those clients.
If an asset class that they choose to have is one that we need to be able to provide a service for and we'll now
offer cryptocurrency custody for those fund managers, and that's the way we're thinking about it. So, it is really
providing a service that we do for their other asset classes for cryptocurrency. And we've selected NYDIG to help

us with that from a sub-custodian standpoint and actually a number of other banks do that as well, sometimes for
their own customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q

Got it. And the revenue opportunity, any high level color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
We haven't defined the revenue opportunity. It's early innings of this capability, certainly. And so, it is really
providing a full set of services to those customers.

Hey, sorry. Sorry for the follow-up. But you gave us the $60 million to $70 million expected decline in PPP in the
