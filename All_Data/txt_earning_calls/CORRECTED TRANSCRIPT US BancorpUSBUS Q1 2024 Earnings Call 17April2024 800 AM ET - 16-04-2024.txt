George Andersen
Director-Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm joined by our chairman, President, and Chief
Executive Officer, Andy Cecere; our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, Terry Dolan; and Senior
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Stern. Together with some initial prepared remarks,
Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and
supplemental analyst schedules are on our website at U.S. Bank.com.
Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty.
Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's
presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3. In the first
quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.78 which included $0.12 per share of notable items. Excluding
notables, earnings per share totaled $0.90.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We are maintaining our through-the-cycle underwriting discipline and seeing
the benefits of our multiyear investments in digital, technology, and payments ecosystem in the form of strong fee
growth across our business lines. Importantly, we continued to accrete capital this quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended
the period at 10.0% and our return on tangible common equity ratio was 17.4% on an adjusted basis.
Slide 4 provides additional performance metrics on both a reported and adjusted basis. On slide 5, I'll provide
some additional high-level observations for the quarter. Starting with the balance sheet, credit quality metrics
continue to develop in line with our expectations, and we achieved healthy growth in tangible book value per
share on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Loan and deposit growth remains under pressure for the
industry, and that dynamic impacted our net interest income this quarter. Our NII on a taxable equivalent basis of
approximately $4 billion was within our guidance, albeit on the lower end of the range. We are seeing good
opportunities for loan growth in targeted portfolios and notably, we continue to see consumer deposit growth
despite the impact of QT on industry deposit levels.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Over the past few weeks, the outlook for potential rate cuts in 2024 has meaningfully changed as long-term rates
have backed up. Client behavior across the industry is adjusting in response to the potential higher-for-longer
interest rate environment that has impacted our deposit mix and pressure deposit costs. As a result, we now
expect our NII for the full year to be lower than anticipated. However, we are taking a closer look at our expense
base given these near-term NII headwinds and plan to take actions to mitigate the impact of lower than expected
NII to our overall profitability. John will go into more details on these topics, but importantly, we believe this is a
near-term phenomena.
Turning to slide 6, we continue to feel good about the momentum across our differentiated fee businesses. Fee
income represents about 40% of our total net revenue, which stands to position us well in a lower interest rate
environment. Overall, we are encouraged by our current trends in our client growth and penetration rates as
evidenced by the continued strength we have seen across many of our fee revenue businesses this quarter.
Slide 7 provides an update on our differentiated payments ecosystem. Over the past few years, we have made
good progress to both expand our business banking and payments relationships and grow related revenue
associated with these relationships. You may recall we discussed an opportunity to grow small business
relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% a few years ago. As you can see on this slide,
we're making good progress and see even greater opportunity to further expand these relationships and related
revenue in the medium term.
Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as provide forward-
looking guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. On slide 8, we provide an earnings summary. This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share
of $0.78 or $0.90 per share after adjusting for notable items including the last of merger and integration costs of
$155 million following our acquisition of Union Bank and $110 million related to anticipated increase in the FDIC
special assessment.
Turning to slide 9, total average loans were $371 billion, down 0.5% linked quarter as growth was impacted by
slow industry loan demand in the current higher interest rate environment. Despite tightening monetary policy and
ongoing pressure on industry-wide deposits, our total average deposits of $503 billion were stable linked quarter
as we continue to see our efforts to grow consumer-related deposits materialize.
End-of-period deposit growth was a little higher than we would typically see in the first quarter. Trust and
corporate deposit inflows are seasonally higher at the end of the first quarter. However, the impact of holiday
timing at quarter end delayed planned outflows of institutional deposits, which resulted in temporarily higher cash
levels. We expect deposit outflows to move in line with more typical seasonal patterns.
Importantly, we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet by prioritizing opportunities that exceeded our
cost of capital and further optimized our funding mix. We continued to limit our reliance on short-term borrowings
and remain disciplined on deposit rate paid as we focus on relationship-based deposits.
Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.0 billion, down
3.1% linked quarter, and net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 2.70%. Both net interest income and net
interest margin declines were driven by continued unfavorable deposit mix shift and deposit pricing pressure as
well as slower loan demand.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income increased 7.7% or $193 million on a year-
over-year basis driven by higher payments revenue, continued strength in underlying capital markets activity, and
stronger mortgage banking fees. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income as adjusted decreased 1.4% or
$38 million reflective of seasonal declines in payments volume and previously discussed impacts related to the
exiting of our ATM cash provisioning business, which pressured service charges, and lower tax credit syndication
fees which impacted other revenue.
Turning to slide 12, reported noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which included approximately
$265 million of notable items. Noninterest expense as adjusted decreased $10 million or 0.2% on a linked-quarter
basis and $117 million or 2.7% year-over-year driven by both cost synergies with Union Bank and our continued
focus on operational efficiency.
Slide 13 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with our
expectations. Linked quarter, non-performing assets increased 20% reflecting continued stress in our commercial
real estate office portfolio and one idiosyncratic commercial loan. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and
other real estate was 0.48% at March 31 compared with 0.40% at December 31 and 0.30% a year ago.
Our first quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.53% increased 4 basis points from a fourth quarter level of 0.49% and
was higher when compared to a first quarter 2023 level of 0.3%, as adjusted. Our allowance for credit losses as of
March 31 totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period end loans.
Turning to slide 14, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.0% as of March 31 was reflective of a 10-basis-point
increase from year end which included 20 basis points of net capital accretion offset by a CECL transitional
impact of 10 basis points. We remain well above our regulatory capital minimum requirements.
I will now provide forward-looking guidance on slide 15. We expect net interest income for the second quarter on
an FTE basis to be relatively stable with the first quarter level of approximately $4.0 billion. Full year 2024 net
interest income on an FTE basis is now expected to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. Our revised
guidance reflects a shift in commercial client deposit behavior in a higher-for-longer rate environment and
heightened competitive industry dynamics.
For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in noninterest income. Given the pressure we are
seeing on net interest income, we are reducing our expense guidance for the year. We now expect full year
noninterest expense of $16.8 billion or lower, which compares to $17.0 billion in 2023.
Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John. We have been preparing for a wide range of economic scenarios for some time now, and we
continue to deliver industry-leading returns despite the current industry stress. Our diverse business mix is
allowing us to differentiate in a competitive market, and we are seeing the benefit of the investments we've made
and continue to make in our digital capabilities, our technology modernization, and our payments ecosystem.
The message I'd like to leave you with is that we will successfully navigate through the near-term challenges the
industry is facing, but more importantly, we are well positioned for the future and continue to manage the
company with a long-term lens.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper
Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Was hoping either Andy or John, you could talk just in a little
more detail about sort of the nuance in the tougher NII guide for the full year. So I guess, at an industry level,
we've got a couple dynamics at play, whether it's the challenging loan growth environment or, of course, the
impact of higher-for-longer on deposit costs and beta. So maybe the main one or two kind of pressure points you
saw. And then I guess as the follow-up. It doesn't feel like there'll necessarily be a lot more pressure on NII, it's
just that it might not advance in the second half, that's the way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Scott. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe just take a step back just to answer your question.
In January, when we talked about our guidance, we looked at – and we expected our 2024 net interest income to
be in line with the annualized fourth quarter number, given that was past MUB actions that we had taken
throughout the course of the year. And so to your point, we're 1% to 3% lower than that, that new guide – with our
new guidance here.
And the outlook really speaks to changes or the dynamics that we have in the economy, the interest rate
environment, the dynamics in the deposit environment, those sorts of things. The conversation, of course, has
shifted. At the beginning of the year, there was multiple cuts. Now we're shifting to more higher-for-longer. And
what we've witnessed over that time is that our client behavior, particularly in the corporate and mid-market
sections, have been shifting their behavior, and clients are continuing to rotate out of low-cost deposits into
higher-cost deposits.

U.S. Bancorp

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
And the pace of this action is slowing. We absolutely see that. It's just not slowing as fast as what we would have
anticipated. So to boil that all together, what we do see now with our guidance is that we have – the second
quarter net interest income will be relatively stable and we should see growth in the second half of the year. And
we've provided a range given that uncertainty in terms of client behavior and things of that variety.
And the final thing I would just say is that we recognized this upfront and we're taking action. We are looking at
our expense base and taking action and pulling some levers that we have been looking at. And so that's kind of
how we think about the guidance from a big-picture perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John. And, Scott, I'd just add that we continue to look for opportunities to improve efficiencies, particularly
in this higher-for-longer rate environment. So we benefited from the $900 million cost takeouts from the Union
Bank transaction and we continue to focus on additional efficiencies in areas like procurement and third-party
spend, our workplace management, and our properties and real estate. And probably the area of greatest
emphasis is operational efficiencies as we centralize our operations activities and technology investments we've
made to really improve the effectiveness and efficiency in how we deliver our products and services. So that will
continue to be a focus and a lens for us, and those are the actions we're taking.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess maybe just following up on NII, John, if we could drill a little bit into it. One, the securities yield went down
1 basis point sequentially. Just remind us of the dynamic both in terms of the security book and fixed rate asset
repricing that we should be mindful of going forward. And then noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, saw a big
surge at the end of the quarter. Again, what's the right way to think about NIB balances and mix as we look
forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So maybe I'll start with your first question on the securities yield. It was relatively flat or down 1 basis point,
as you cited. This quarter was a little bit different. We had taken some hedging actions that actually offset some of
the asset churn that we typically would see. And so I would view this as more of a temporary thing.
As I look forward, the typical churn that you see in asset repricing of that book, as a reminder, we developed $3
billion per quarter that is rolling off at the lower level and we'll replace. And so that's really going to be what we're
looking at kind of going forward. So I just look at this as an anomaly.
On the deposit side, yeah, we did – I believe your question was on the surge in deposits. We did see a surge at
the end of the quarter. There was a holiday in there. A lot of customers placed balances with us, very much
temporary. A lot of those balances kind of hung on in and out here through tax season. And so we typically have
that, it's just higher than what we would typically see for various reasons. And so, as we've mentioned in our
comments, we expect that to get to more seasonal levels.
And then just – your follow-on was really on the noninterest-bearing side of things. It's continuing to trend down
that mix of NIB versus total deposits. We're kind of in that 17% category right now. As we're in a higher-for-longer,
it's possible that continues to drift lower just based on the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just separately around outlook for fee revenues, I think Andy addressed that in his prepared
remarks, but give us a sense of any – what areas you're seeing momentum on the fee revenue side and whether
there's any room for sort of upside surprise if we get additional negative guide down on NII? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, sure. So, I mean, overall, we feel very – we're pleased with the quarter one results. We saw good account
growth. We're deepening relationships. We continue to see progress on Union and the growth opportunities that
we see there. Consumer spending metrics, all the underlying metrics are strong. Capital markets activities are
strong. And that is supportive of our continual view on mid-single digit growth on the fee aspect of things.
Areas that we see growth, we particularly have seen that in the capital market space. We have extremely strong
fixed income capital markets activity. A lot of issuance that came to market, and our franchise absolutely
benefited from that. Mortgage has continued to be strong in terms of – even though applications and production
has been lower on a year-over-year basis, we're actually seeing much wider spreads just given the areas that
we're focusing on. And that's just the constant theme of how we're focusing on more return on equity or higher
returns overall.

And then the payments business continues to do well and be in line with our expectations, and so that helps to
support the payments ecosystem that we have and all the initiatives and investment that we've made over time.
So all that is very much coming together, and we feel very comfortable about our fee outlook.

Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
How are you thinking about the outlook for net charge-offs and provision and just kind of the credit trends you saw
this quarter? John, you mentioned there was the one idiosyncratic commercial. Other than that, kind of, what are
you seeing, and you're still kind of thinking about a mid-50s kind of net charge-off outlook for this year? That
would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, John, this is Terry. Let me take that question. So when we end up looking at credit, again, credit generally
is pretty strong. I think that we're continuing to see in non-performing assets that that will continue to tick up and
did tick up in the first quarter. It's primarily related to commercial real estate office space, and I think when we
think about kind of the rest of the year, probably in the second quarter, it's going to tick up a bit more but then that
growth rate it's going to really moderate quite a bit.
The thing to keep in mind with respect to commercial real estate office space is that we've aggressively reserved
for that. We feel like we've adequately covered the loss content that's in that portfolio. So even though NPAs are
likely to tick up, we don't see that as a real impact from a P&L standpoint.
From a charge-off point of view, in the first quarter that's principally driven by just credit cards, and our
expectation is that that will probably in the second quarter also come up. But then on a full-year basis, the charge-
off rate that we would expect in credit cards is probably going to move up a bit in the second quarter and then
9


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
start to moderate downward again. On a full-year basis, we would expect that charge-off rate to be pretty similar
to the charge-off rate that we see in the first quarter of about 4.25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Got it. And then for the overall company, kind of, still kind of trending to that mid-50s perhaps on the
charge-offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I would say mid-50s, maybe closer to the 60 basis points. And again I think that it's going to be a little bit
lumpy because of just timing of commercial real estate charge-offs that will occur through the year. But again we
feel like we've adequately reserved for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. Okay. Great. And then, Andy, how are you thinking about the expense? Once you mentioned offsetting the
NII, I guess within reason, you're going to flex the expenses depending on the revenue environment plays out
through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, John. So it is an environment that it's always important to look at efficiencies and that's something we're
very focused on. And it is in those areas we talked about, we'll continue to flex where we see opportunities. We've
centralized operations. We have our other opportunities in spend. It's a company-wide initiative and we'll continue
to focus on that. Again importantly though I want to tell you, John, that we're still investing but we're looking at
operational efficiencies as we deliver our products and services while continued investments. Because
investments we've made is helping us with the efficiencies on a go-forward basis.

Welcome back, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks so much. So I had a follow-up on the comments around corporate behavior in the deposit shift from NIB. I
just want to understand two things. One, do you see your corporate deposits shifting from NIB to IB, or is it more
NIB to MMF? And then separately, typically corporates are in NIB because it's compensating balances for other
services. So as the shift is going on, does it suggest that we're going to see an uptick in say, for example,
Treasury services or any of the other fee lines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Betsy. It's John. Thanks for that. So in terms of the behavior, I think what we're seeing is the trends are
slowing. The rotation is going – maybe first to answer your question, more from NIB into more IB. It's more of a –
it's the trade-off for the client. And what we're seeing really there is clients are just optimizing and being as – just
looking at their balance sheet, looking at their balances, especially in this higher rate environment and now that
they know it's going to be here for a longer period of time, they're taking a closer eye to it. We're just seeing that
more and more.
So the trends have been slowing of that mix shift. It's just taking longer than what we would have anticipated. So
in terms of compensating balances, those are the things that are on a case-by-case basis with the clients. We
look at the ECR rates that we pay and customers will then make decisions based on that. And so those are kind
of the trade-offs that we see relative to that right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So treasury services potentially could see a little pop-up in growth as how you pay for services changes, or
is that an overreach?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It's possible, but again, the dynamic's pretty fluid is kind of how I would describe it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And also, folks are staying on your balance sheet as opposed to going off balance sheet into NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
That's right. Yeah, a lot of this is defending the clients and making sure we're there for them. Again, we view this
as a temporary phenomenon. It's just a timing thing. It's really just – the churn here is continuing. It's just being –
the pace of it is taking a little bit longer for it to stabilize than what we would have anticipated, and that's really
what's going on here. We want to make sure we're here for the long run for our clients and serving them as we
kind of transition through this rate environment.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. And then just kind of 30,000 foot question here, just could you help us
understand how you are currently thinking about the asset sensitivity of U.S. Bancorp at this stage? How should
we think about what higher-for-longer means for you for the whole organization? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, sure. So I think in terms of asset sensitivity from a risk management perspective, we are as neutral as you
can be. We've taken a lot of different actions to make sure – because we just don't know where the rate
environment is. I mean, it was seven cuts at the beginning of the year the market had, now it's closer to zero. So
we just want to make sure we are prepared for different type of rate environments. And so I think as we think
about the asset sensitivity, that is really how we're positioning ourselves.
As we think about higher-for-longer and what that means, the drivers there are going to be clearly deposit betas
and rate and paid and all that sort of thing, they creep up. The offset to that is we're going to asset churn on the
loan side as well as the investment portfolio side, and over time those things will offset and turn ultimately in our
favor. But it's going to be that timing that's really going to matter in terms of what are those things move and shift
over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Betsy, as John said – this is Andy – we've tried to narrow the corridor of volatility given the uncertainty in the
outlook. And so we are about as neutral as we can be given all the puts and takes John talked about.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. If I could ask a couple questions on the fee side. One, can we just talk a little bit
through the payments businesses? Looks like the overall year-over-year growth rate was 4%. I think you're
aspiring for upper-single digits. It looks like corporate was down year-over-year and maybe the rate in merchant
12


U.S. Bancorp

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
slowed a little bit. So can you just talk us through some of those dynamics and then how you'd expect that to
traject going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Yeah, I think – thanks, Ken. I appreciate that. We can look at – maybe I'll take them in order. Merchant was
kind of in that 4% area, as you mentioned, on the fee side of things. On that side, this quarter we saw travel being
a little bit down. But the other underlying metrics really had strong growth. We saw our tech-led initiatives really
continue to propel very nicely. We saw high-single digit for virtually all the other categories in that space. So we
think the travel is a – it's just kind of a short-term nature thing here and we're well positioned and continue to feel
good about high-single digits there.
On the corporate payment side, as you mentioned, that was negative over this year-over-year basis, but we are
lapping the freight weight that has happened over the past year. And that will really churn – there might be a little
bit more of that in the second quarter, but we see strong momentum as we look – again, the fundamentals of
business spend and things like that are continuing to be in case, so we feel good about high-single digits.
And then on the card side, really strong fee growth, good spreads, payment rates and payment spend trends
constructive for how we're thinking about it. So all that – we feel good about all the underlying trends from a
payments standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of some of the other lines. Corporate services and mortgage did a lot better. I
think you mentioned DCM and corporate and better gain on sale. Just wondering, are those both sustainable or
was there any pull-forward on both of those areas this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think it is. I think the underlying strength maybe had a little bit of positivity here in the first quarter. But underlying
all that, I think the gain on sale in the markets that we're playing is legitimate, even though that market has been
slower from an application standpoint and production standpoint. It's still kind of double digit, almost 20% down
from year-over-year. So there's just – there's a lot of – the volumes are lower but the spreads are wider, and we
anticipate that to continue going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And last cleanup one. Just that ATM business, it didn't look like service charges changed. Is it that
close? And I know it's not a net profit. I know it's neutral net profit, but can you just update us on that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. There was some of that in this quarter, and so they'll kind of fully run off here in the second quarter.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Another one on – hi. Another one on net interest income. Andy, you used the word temporary in your opening
remarks, talking about either the decline or the worse guide, and I didn't know what you meant by temporary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So what we're saying, Mike, is that this pressure that, as John described, we believe is going to dissipate and has
dissipated. It's just dissipating slower than we thought. And we expect relatively stable in the second quarter and
then growth in the back half of 2024. So that's what I meant by temporary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Do you have any expectation for 2025 and where the floor is for noninterest-bearing deposits or any other color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So I would expect that 2025 will continue the momentum that we see in the second half of 2024. We're not going
to give a 2025 guide right now because it's so volatile in terms of what rates could be, but importantly, Mike, we
see the second half of 2024 even in a lower rate cut environment and higher-for-longer to start to go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And I know I've asked this before, but it still applies, I think. So the big picture here is, you've got $900 million of
savings in the Union Bank acquisition, so that's good for the expenses. The revenues, you highlight in your slide,
14


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
business banking is up one-third over three years in terms of revenues and relationships. You have mortgage,
you have capital markets, you have payments. The revenues are working, the expenses are working, and then we
look at the efficiency ratio for this quarter, and the core number is like around 62% for a company that for so long
had an efficiency ratio under 60%.
Now, I know you're investing a lot nationally. We heard that at the [ph] BAT (00:32:05) conference. But it's just
like, when do you get under 60%? And I get the NII effect that distorts things, but you do have some peers that
are under 60% now. So how should we think about efficiency at U.S. Bancorp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Mike, that's why we're pulling these expense levers and looking at continuing to create efficiency. So I feel
very positive about our fee categories. We have a diversified set of businesses. A lot of businesses that other
banks don't have like payments and commercial products, fund services, corporate trust, that helps us drive fee
revenue. That's the strength that we talked about, that 7.7%. There are some headwinds on margin for the
industry and for ourself. We'll get past those headwinds and we'll continue to operate efficiently and look for
expense levers to get that efficiency ratio downward, and that's an objective of ours.

Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Morning. Morning. On the deposit growth in the quarter, the surge in growth you saw on end of period, can you
maybe size up the impact that was more seasonal and more tied to the holiday dynamic and how much that could
pull back.
And then separately, also on your NII commentary, you did mention the competitive landscape shifting. Is that just
regarding the deposit mix and pricing or you're also seeing some competitive dynamics impacting you on the loan
front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, John. Thanks. Maybe to answer your second question first, it's more of the deposit mix and rate paid. It's not
necessarily the loan side. I think actually on the loan side, we see – even though loans are soft at this point, we
15


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
do see decent momentum on the commercial side. We saw good period-end growth there. Spreads are good.
The asset churn is positive all there. I think it's just – again, it's back on the deposit side of things and the mix.
And I would say even on the mix, I would say on the commercial side, it's just a rotational thing. The rates
environment really hasn't changed in the commercial side. On the retail side, sometimes rates go up, sometimes
down depending on geography and market and all those sorts of things. But we're competitive there and we want
to make sure we've been growing and we have been growing. We've been growing consumer deposits as we
mentioned.
Back on your first question on the deposit surge, it's probably in the area of $15 billion to $20 billion that we
received. We get a lot of inflow at the end of the quarter as people prepare for outflowing payments, end of the
month type payments or first of the month as well as 5th of the month, and then sometimes they just hold it all the
way through the tax season. That's exactly what we've seen here is that you get this kind of surge up at the end of
the quarter. It holds for the duration through tax day, and then it starts to wind down. That's been very seasonal.
It's just a bigger number than what we have typically seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. And then separately, on the expense efforts that where you're taking a closer look and you
mentioned some of the areas, are those measures that you've taken fully reflected in that updated expense
outlook of $16.8 billion for the year, or could your efforts drive a somewhat lower number as you evaluate the
opportunity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, John, they're reflected in the efforts. That's why we brought it down to $200 million. In the note, you'll see that
says $16.8 billion at least. So we could pull additional levers as we continue to focus on this but it is reflected in
the guidance.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I just want to probe, Andy, a comment that you expect net interest income to go up in the second half of 2024.
Could you talk a little bit about what you see as the drivers of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I'm going to let John start and I'll add on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, the driver is really, Vivek, as we talked about, it comes down to the deposit side of things really first and
foremost. And again, we're seeing the migration and rotation slow. Again, it's just taking some time. So eventually
as that goes, that will stabilize. And then you're going to have the continual asset churn on both loans as well as
investment portfolio, things like that.
I would also say that we've taken a lot of action to enhance return on equity. We're looking at capital efficient
ways to grow that. Those underlying themes continue. The Union growth opportunities that we see and loan
spreads have been favorable. So those are kind of the reasons that we see a positive nature and bend to the net
interest income that Andy talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So as John said, it's the repricing of loans, the expectation of stabilization of the flow of deposits and the
securities portfolio churn that we talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And the hedge that you did which you said was an anomaly this quarter, could you talk a little bit about
that? Was that for – that's not going to have an ongoing impact. Was that just something that you put on for
capital protection, or what was it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Yeah, so it really was more again our asset sensitivity continue to be neutral. So those are actions that we
took kind of as a one-time matter. So it's in the rate and go-forward. That's why I called it as a temporary measure
here in this quarter. Going forward, again, the driver here in the investment portfolio is the $3 billion or so that's
rolling off at lower yields and will be replaced at now current higher interest rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Because you had always said you were neutral, so that's why I was trying to understand what sort of
change to make that you had to do to make it go to neutral.

Yeah. Those are part of the actions that we take to get neutral. And those are the things that the team looks at on
a frequent basis. We're actively managing that on a daily basis. We're looking at markets. We're taking actions
and this is just the result of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And is that what, just, receive fix swaps you added or terminated, or what did you do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, specifically they were just – they were pay fix swaps that we had terminated. They were shorter dated in
nature but it reduced the yield because the pay fix carry was – had been gone but that just neutralized our interest
rate sensitivity.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John and Andy, can you share with us – obviously you had a nice move up in your CET1 ratio, it's now at 10%,
and we all know the Basel III endgame is coming. Nobody knows for certain when that final proposal will be in
place. But it seems like for the Category II and III banks that the unrealized securities losses will be carried
through regulatory capital which is not the case today of course. So with that as a backdrop, can you update us
on where you want that CET1 ratio? And historically, you guys have been so good at giving back 75% to 80% of
your annual earnings in dividends and buybacks, and when do you think we could possibly get back on that kind
of track?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Gerard. I'll start. First of all, just to give an update on the unrealized loss, so from a positive standpoint, part
of the hedging and activities that we do that I just talked about in prior questions really help here because we had
18

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
even though rates went up 30 basis points, 40 basis points throughout the quarter, our AOCI was fairly neutral.
And so the impact to the AOCI from the investment portfolio and pension right now is about 220 basis points
versus the 10.0% that we have on Common Equity Tier 1.
You're right, the Basel III endgame and all those sorts of things that along with I would call CCAR results for us
are two important milestones we need to see before we make any grand declarations on what our capital ratios
will be going forward. In the meantime, we'll continue to build our capital levels. And what we'll also do is focus on
our returns. Obviously, the dividend is a large priority. Additional priority is investing in the company, and so we're
pausing on share repurchases at this time as we build the capital. Over time, we will normalize back to kind of
where we were. But this is kind of that transitional period that we're in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And coming back to – stepping back for a moment, now that the Union Bank I assume is fully
integrated. Obviously that has been your focus since that acquisition, can you share with us your thoughts about
de novo expansion? You had that expansion down in the Charlotte area. Is there more to come now that, again,
the acquisition is behind you? What's your thoughts there as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Gerard, we're focused on building our core customer base and deepening the relationships with the
customers we have through the set of products and services that we offer. We do that through a number of
mechanisms. One of them is through our branch system, one of them is through our relationship managers and
working together, and that de novo effort is doing well.
We also have partnerships with State Farm which increase our distribution base. So we'll continue to look at all
those levers, but the bottom line is that we continue to focus on more customers, deeper relationships across the
diverse set of businesses that we have, and a lot of the opportunity, Gerard, is providing more services to
customers who already are customers of U.S. Bank and could benefit from some of the other products and
services that we offer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, Andy, just a quick follow-up on that deepening customer relationship that you just identified. When it comes
to your middle market commercial or your core commercial account, if they only have a loan relationship versus
one of your preferred accounts that have multiple relationships, that deepening you just mentioned, what kind of
profit differential would you estimate there is between a customer that only has a loan versus your customer that
has multiple products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It's significantly higher. The more relationships, the higher the return, the more revenue certainly. So if they have
a loan only versus a loan plus deposit plus treasury management plus commercial products plus payments, it all
adds up.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
There's obviously a lot of puts – there's obviously a lot of puts and takes like as you think about the net interest
margin over time. But we've seen a number of banks put out kind of this medium-term NIM target and wondering
if you have any thoughts on what a more sustainable NIM is for you guys. You talked about the securities kind of
cash flowing $3 billion. I don't know if there is any kind of underwater swap that our churn can roll off. But I guess
the question is what do you think about NIM kind of medium term versus where you are right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I'll start here, Matt. In terms of the net interest margin, it's going to obviously track net interest income over
time but it may bounce around. Some of the drivers of that obviously can be some of the things you just
mentioned, the asset churn on the investment portfolio, the creep-in on deposit costs and things like that. But
cash levels and liquidity mix and things of that variety can also drive it as well. So we don't really have a call or a
base of here's where our net interest margin. We're more focused on net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then are there any – again, the securities book, you're pretty clear on the cash flow there and I think that's
fairly long duration from a cash flow perspective. Any swaps that we should be mindful of that could go either way
looking out the next couple years?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
The swap activity that we have. Yeah, so just as a – our hedging – while we're very active in our hedging
activities, there's really no fundamental change. We continue to focus on pay-fixed swaps that hedged the
investment portfolio. Obviously, we took some off that impacted but that's a temporary thing. We still have well
over 30% – well over a third actually of our risk hedged on the securities book. And then we have been adding
receive-fixed swaps as well. Some of that spot, some of that forward starting depending on the nature – as the
curve has come up here and the curve has flattened and higher, that's an excellent opportunity for us to add some
protection for the downside if and when that does occur. And all that adds up to be kind of in that net neutral
interest rate risk position that we're in.

I guess another one on NII. Your guidance does assume some modest reacceleration of NII in the back end. I
think second half NII is at the midpoint 2% higher than the first half. But what's embedded in – can you be more
specific about what's embedded in the through-the-cycle deposit beta assumption. And, John, you mentioned
noninterest bearing could continue to move down a little bit from 17%. How far could – what's your best guess
now as to how much more deposit migration and where that ultimately could land at and what's sort of embedded
in the guidance for those measures?

John C. Stern A

Sure, Saul. It's John. So on the beta side specifically, that has continued to slow. I think we're only up 1 or 2
points here this quarter, and it was 3 points in the prior quarter. So, it clearly has slowed. And as I mentioned,
deposit rates in the commercial side are very flat. They have not changed. Retail bounces around a little bit. And
we're going to be competitive and follow the market there, of course. But all in, if you're higher-for-longer, it may
creep up a point here or two. But we feel like the low 50s is probably the right place for that to be as we kind of
look forward.

Yeah, as I mentioned a little bit on the noninterest-bearing side, we're about 17%. Customers are being more
efficient and things like that. It could go down a couple points as we stay a little bit lower or at this higher-for-
longer-type period.

Okay. Great. And I guess a follow-up on – just a clarification on the deposit surge, your response to an earlier
question on the deposit surge. Forgive me if I missed this, but the $15 billion to $20 billion surge, that's a normal
surge in noninterest-bearing deposits. But I guess the question is, what's sort of the incremental to the normal
surge? What was incremental this quarter to what you normally see? I'm just trying to get a base on which to
forecast noninterest-bearing deposits going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So in terms of the surge, the surge in absolute terms was like – it was about $20 billion or so. It's probably
10-or-so billion dollars above and beyond what we typically see or this type for the quarter.

Okay. Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just kind of still a cleanup on NII. Just in very simple terms, if you're neutral to rates, why is the guide lower for
NII? I just want to make sure I have that [indiscernible] (00:49:15) something happen that you didn't expect or you
weren't fully neutral before this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, sure, Mike. It's John. So the – yes, we are neutral, to answer your question, to shocks, to interest rates. I
think what we're explaining is the behavioral aspect of it, which sometimes can be a little more challenging to
judge at that point in time. And so, again, it's a little bit – the pace of rotation is a little bit – it's slowing down, just
not as much as what we had anticipated. So again, rate shocks moving up and down. We continue to feel very
good from a neutral standpoint. It's just that behavioral aspect that we've been talking about here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And do you have a number for fixed asset repricing, say, to the end of next year? Because I think that's what's
driving your higher guide for the second half this year and into next year. So, you've talked about $3 billion of
securities, but by the end of next year, how much do you have in fixed asset that should reprice? Do you have,
like, one grand number for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, I think the way I would think about it is about half of our loan book is fixed rate component, the other half is
floating rate component, and spreads are widening. So you can see some of the floating rate components
perhaps improve over time. We're seeing decent growth in payments – or excuse me, credit card. And so some of
the mix is also working at play here. And so, commercial loans are coming on. They're coming on at wider
spreads. So that's kind of how I think about that from a big-picture perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last one. Loan spreads, I mean, for a while there, it looks like we're heading into the recession and loan
spreads were not widening. Now it looks like we're not having a recession and you have tight spreads in the
capital markets and loan spreads are widening. Just why are loan spreads widening now? I guess that would be
an incremental positive.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Yeah, so I think it's just different markets. So I think some of the drag you're seeing in the commercial volume side
is capital markets spreads have been and the access has been very good. We saw that reflected in our fixed
income capital market fees and things of that variety. But I think that has taken away volume to a certain extent. In
other areas where access to capital markets isn't as pronounced, I would say there has been decent opportunity
for spreads there.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Hey, John, just quick follow-up to make sure we get this right. The surge deposits that came in, I think
you mentioned you expect about $15 billion to leave. Is all of that going out of noninterest bearing? So the $91
billion number, does that go into the mid-70s as we think about the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, some of this is temporary. So the surge that happens, it can be a mix of both money market as well as NIB. It
may surge the NIB for a brief period of time, but it's not going to be material to the quarter. So the surge that
we've been talking about can be a mix of both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Mix of both. And so you do expect just from a very dollar balance standpoint NIB staying north of $80 billion? Is
that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I would expect, as we said, the rotation is continuing. So I wouldn't expect growth necessarily in DDA. But
deposits overall we do expect to basically be stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just a separate question. Given all these questions on NII, I think I would love to hear the degree of
conservatism baked into your NII outlook. Because I guess the concern we're hearing is whether we see another
downward guide three months from now. Yeah, so in terms of what would go wrong in order for us to see another
guide down on NII for you to be surprised? Thank you.
