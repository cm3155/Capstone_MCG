Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and staying
safe.
Before addressing our quarter results, I'd first like to discuss the current business environment in Puerto Rico, as
outlined in the first two slides of the presentation. The pandemic and related economic disruption continues to
have a significant impact on the markets we serve, particularly in Puerto Rico. The strict lockdown mandated by
the Governor of Puerto Rico on March 15, helped curtail the initial spread of the pandemic. As a result, starting on
May 26, many of the restrictions that were in place were gradually loosened and the local economy largely
reopened over the past couple of months.
As economy reopen, we had started to see a revival in business activity, especially in the month of June.
However, the recent surge in positive cases and hospitalization led the Governor, on July 16, to announce the
rollback of some business and recreational activities and to impose further restrictions on inbound travel. While
affecting a much smaller portion of economy than the original lockdown, these restrictions will undoubtedly have a
significant impact on the hotel, and restaurant segment, the severity of which will depend on the length of these
restrictions.
Employment trend deteriorated rapidly in April, and are still down significantly compared to last year, but they
have begun to stabilize. The peak in unemployment claims to date in 2020 was during the first week of April, non-
farm employment improved by nearly 5% from April to June. New auto sales had been severely impacted by the
lockdown and were 49% lower in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2019. However, June
was the best month of auto sales in the past decades, and auto sales were 5% higher than the year-ago period.
Additionally, cement sales in the second quarter were 6% lower than last year's second quarter, but up 42% in the
month of June year-over-year.
Our customer spending increased as the economy reopened. While debit and credit card sales in the second
quarter were down 5%, compared to the year-ago period, they increased 7% sequentially from the first quarter. In
June alone, sales were 43% higher than in June 2019. Similarly, while BPPR second quarter mortgage
originations were 50% lower than the second quarter of 2019, originations for the month of June were on par with
2019 results.
Tourism however continues to lag. Hotel occupancy bottomed in April at 4%. However, as restrictions were lifted,
occupancy levels had increased to 23% by mid-June, driven primarily by internal summer tourism. Additionally,
according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, hotel occupancy reached 78% over the three year Fourth of July
weekend, 92% of which were local tourists. However, we are already seeing this positive trend reversed as a
result of the recently-announced restrictions. According to the Operator of the San Juan International Airport,
during June 2020, arrivals decreased by 67% compared to June 2019. And year-to-date through June, Puerto
Rico received 46% fewer passengers than during the same period in 2019.
Local and federal governments continue to provide relief and assistance in response to the pandemic. The Puerto
Rico Government has approved $787 million in fiscal stimulus. Also, it had estimated that Puerto Rico will receive
approximately $14 billion in funds under various federal stimulus programs. Puerto Rico residents are entitled to
receive the supplemental federal unemployment benefits of $600 per week, so that benefit is currently scheduled
to sunset on July 31.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
As a management team, we've taken measures to ensure the soundness of our operation and the safety of our
employees and customers. Most of our branches are open, though some are still operating under reduced
schedules. We are communicating regularly with our employees to keep them informed of the evolving health and
business environment. We continue to offer alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our
employee base. We have established a return to work protocol to ensure a safe transition back to on-premise
activity when deemed advisable. I'm also happy to announce that during the quarter, we extended healthcare
coverage to part-time employees.
We remain focused on supporting our customers and enhancing their experience at Popular. We are providing
broad payment relief for our consumer and commercial lending clients. We've encouraged customers to use
alternative digital banking options. We've seen a 13% increase in active online users since March 2020, and
surpassed 1 million monthly active users on our Mi Banco digital platform in Puerto Rico, a very significant
milestone. Additionally, in the second quarter, we captured 72% of our deposits to digital channels compared to
56% in the first quarter. Finally, and most impressively, given Puerto Rico's recent demographic trends, our
customer base continues to grow, increasing by 52,000 since March 2020 to nearly 1.86 million customers.
Following the passage of the CARES Act, Popular secured funding approval under the SBA's PPP program,
where more than 28,000 loans were small and medium sized businesses, totaling over $1.4 billion, including $1.2
billion in Puerto Rico, $215 million in the mainland United States and $29 million in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In fact,
we originated 69% of all PPP loans originated to date in Puerto Rico. The businesses supported by these loans
employed 278,000 persons and 73% of the loans originated were for less than $25,000.
Additionally, Popular has secured more than $300,000 in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York grants to support
local non-profits and small businesses in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Metro area. As we continue to respond to this
rapidly changing situation, our plans and actions will continue to evolve.
Please turn to Slide 5, as in the first quarter, our second quarter results reflect the impact of the economic
disruption caused by the pandemic. Our quarterly net income of $128 million was higher than the $34 million
reported in the first quarter. However, it was down 25% from the $131 million reported in the year-ago period.
Second quarter results were driven by lower provisions. Revenues were down in the quarter and were partially
offset by lower operating expenses. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the cumulative impact of
interest rate cuts by the Fed, partially offset by the issuance of the PPP loans, lower deposit costs, and the
increase in our investment portfolio, driven by higher deposit balances. Credit quality trends remain stable.
However, the full extent of future economic disruption, as a result of the pandemic, is still uncertain.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos who will discuss the financial results in more detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning.
Please turn to Slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the appendix for the slide deck.
Today's earnings press release details variances from the first quarter.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $451 million, a decrease of $22 million from the first quarter. Non-
interest income, decreased by $14.6 million to $112 million in Q2, primarily driven by lower deposit service

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
charges by $11.5 million, mainly in Puerto Rico, due to lower transaction volumes and higher deposit balances,
and lower other service fees by $4.7 million as lower construction volumes dropped debit and credit card fees by
$8.6 million. Also contributing to the reduction was the elimination of certain service charges and late fees related
to our response to the pandemic. These items were partially offset by first, an increase in the net unrealized gain
on equity securities of $5.2 million related to employee deferred compensation plan. This entry has an offsetting
expense in the personnel cost line. And second, $4.6 million increase in other operating income mostly due to a
$5.6 million gain from the sale of our corporate office building.
For the last couple of years, non-interest income had a quarterly run rate between $135 million and $140 million.
A lot of moving parts contributed to the difference of $23 million to $28 million between this run rate on our Q2
results. But this reduction is consistent with our prior guidance of potential reductions of around $8 million per
month.
The speed at which we could return to more trend like non-interest income levels will depend on the rate of
reopening of our markets and increasing client activity levels. Provision expense for the quarter was [ph] $62
million, which is $127 million (11:06) lower than Q1. Lidio will expand it later.
Total operating expenses were $348 million, $24 million lower than the prior quarter. Personnel costs decreased
by $7.7 million, driven by lower incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses. Professional fees decreased
by $8.5 million due to lower processing and technology costs, resulting from lower transactions. We also
benefited from lower advisory, legal and tax and accounting expenses. OREO expenses decreased by $2.8
million due to discontinued foreclosure activity related to the pandemic.
Last quarter, we announced that, in response of lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic, we
implemented various cost savings initiatives, affecting personnel-related expenses, professional fees, business
promotion and other operating expenses. We are on track to achieve this $55 million in savings, and thereby
reiterate our expectations of average quarterly expenses for 2020 to be around $69 million – $369 million.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%. For the full year 2020, we currently expect our effective tax rate to
be between 14% and 17%.
Please turn to Slide 7. In the second quarter, we saw a reduction of $22 million in net interest income. The
primary driver of this decrease was the impact of lower market rates on the yields of our investment and loan
portfolios. This was only partially offset by larger balances in both portfolios and lower deposit costs.
The increase in balances in the investment portfolio was related to $9 billion in deposit growth. This increase in
deposits was seen across all segments in Puerto Rico, public, retail and commercial, as many of our customers
benefited from federal COVID assistance initiatives. The increase in the loan portfolio was driven by $1.4 billion in
PPP loans. Our deposit costs were 34 basis points in the quarter, a reduction of 23 basis points, primarily due to
the impact of lower market rates on Puerto Rico public deposits.
NIM decreased by 69 basis points to 3.25% in Q2. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margins was
3.56%, a decrease of 78 basis points. This lower NIM is mainly related to three factors.
First, the impact on our loan and investment yields of the federal funds rates decreasing 150 basis points in mid-
March; second, the significant increase in average deposit, which are mostly invested in overnight Fed funds and
in short-term U.S. Treasury securities; and finally, the origination of $1.4 billion in PPP loans. This asset, although

accretive to net interest income, with an attractive risk-adjusted return are low-yielding and resulted in a
compression in net interest margin.
We expect margin for the rest of 2020 to be steady, but slightly improving from the second quarter level. This
outlook is very dependent on asset mix, loan demand and the deposit levels.
As of the end of the second quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $14 billion, about $4 billion higher
than in Q1. We expect public deposit balances to come down over the long-term. But additional COVID-related
federal assistance as well as the impact of CECL and tax collections would probably lead to increased balances
in the near-term. The rate of expenditure of these funds and the timing of agreement on the government's debt
restructuring will dictate the amount and timetable of any balance reduction.
Our average loan balances grew by $875 million in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by lower-yielding
PPP loans, partially offset by lower levels of higher-yielding consumer balances at BPPR. In the month of June,
we have seen strong rebound in demand in mortgage, auto loans and auto leases, while demand and balances in
our higher-yielding personal loan, and credit card portfolios continue to show net repayment and lower demand.
The level of loan balances for the rest of 2020 will depend on the duration of the PPP loans and the performance
of the economy. As such, we are not providing loan balance guidance at this time.
Please turn to Slide 8. Our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers, as well as with respect to well-
capitalized regulatory requirements. As you may recall, on January 30 of this year, we entered into an accelerated
share repurchase agreement for $500 million of common stock, which was completed on May 27. Popular
received 11.8 million shares at $42.30 per share.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q2 was 15.7%, down from 15.8%. The capital simplification rules, effective
April 1st of 2020, reduced CET1 by 48 basis points. Tangible book value increased in the quarter by almost $4
per share to $60.13. This increase was driven by our quarterly net income, higher realized gains on investment,
and a lower share count, offset somewhat by dividend payments.
In this Slide, we repeat an update, the calculation of our pro forma capital ratios, applying the loss ratio of our last
published DFAST severely adverse stress test from 2017. In this simulation, we still end up with very strong CET1
ratio of 14.5%. These results reflect Popular's robust capital position. For the second quarter of 2020, our
allowance for credit losses represents 52% of our severely adverse DFAST loss estimate.
Our return on average tangible equity was 11.2% in the second quarter. We will continue to pursue our target of
double-digit return on tangible equity.
While Popular is not required to run or publish regulatory stress test, for the last few years, we have completed
our stress test in the summer, developed our capital plan during the third quarter and, upon approval of our Board
of Directors, engage with regulators on capital discussions in the last quarter of the year. This process has
allowed us to disclose our capital plans for the upcoming year early in the first quarter of that year. We now
expect that this timetable will be delayed by one quarter. As a result, we expect to engage in capital discussions
with our regulators early next year. We then will make capital-related announcement in the second quarter of
2021.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos and good morning.
Before discussing the CECL impacts and credit trends for the quarter, I would like to take the opportunity to
highlight changes in Popular credit risk profile since the global financial crisis, which you can see on Slide number
9. Also, one might be tempted to view Popular based on the last crisis in 2008. We are a different company with a
stronger balance sheet and more conservative risk profile.
In the U.S., we shifted from being a lender with significant subprime and construction exposures to a community
and niche lender with a lower risk profile. In Puerto Rico, we also shifted our commercial mix to segments with
lower losses and collateralized consumer loans, mortgage and auto. We believe Popular is well-positioned to
operate successfully during diverse economic environments, given our improved risk profile and changes in our
portfolio mix.
Turning to Slide number 10, we are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our entire loan portfolio. Yet,
certain portfolio segments are more sensitive and are highlighted on this Slide. Within the CRE non-retail
segment, the exposure in Puerto Rico is mainly comprised of office space, while the exposure in the U.S. is
mainly comprised of multi-family. Office space and multi-family occupancy and collections have remained stable
throughout the pandemic. Today, there have been limited numbers of downgrades in these segments. The level
of rate of deferrals mainly relates to customers' liquidity strategies.
In the healthcare facility segment, our Puerto Rico exposure is mainly to hospitals, while our U.S. exposure is to
skilled nursing facility. For both regions, federal and local assistance has supported the industry operation. Today,
there have been a limited number of deferral requests on downgrades in this portfolio.
Within non-essential retail, the shelter-in-place orders have curtailed activity of this segment. As a result, we have
experienced a significant number of deferrals and have downgraded most within the [ph] past rated category 23%
(21:29) of the portfolio. Based on borrower surveys, occupancy have remained stable compared to pre-COVID
levels. Strip malls reported an 86% occupancy and [ph] 83% (21:43) collection rate, while shopping centers
reported an 86% occupancy and 64% collection rate. An important part, of our shopping centers portfolio, in both
regions, are owned by long-term customers with financially strong principles that can withstand short-term
disruption in cash flow.
Regarding auto retail in Puerto Rico, this activity was subject to the lockdown order and sales decreased
significantly. Upon the authorization to resume sales, the segment reported record sales in June with over 10,000
new units sold. Popular historically has had low losses in the dealer segment even during prolonged periods of
decreased auto sales, given the collateralized nature of these loans.
Regarding the construction segment, most of our exposure is in the U.S. and principally in the New York Metro
region. The majority of our projects are in the late stage of completion of low loan to costs and nominal exposure
to higher-end residential. To date, there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this
portfolio.
Our hotel exposure is mostly in Puerto Rico. At the end of the quarter, our total exposure stood at $368 million.
This segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to travel restriction. This segment had started to
reopen gradually as part of the government's reopening plan prior to the imposition of the renew restriction on the
use of beaches and hotel common areas. Puerto Rico would not resume promotion of the destination until August

15. To date, we have had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades, mostly within DFAST category in this
portfolio.
Restaurant balances were $359 million at quarter-end. This segment has experienced stress, driven by the
shelter-in-place orders. Through the lockdown orders, the majority of our restaurant borrowers, particularly quick
service or fast food, have continued to operate through delivery and carryout. As part of the government four-
phase reopening plans, restaurants were allowed to operate, first up 25% capacity, then 50%, then 75% and
reselling went back to 50%. Once the economy fully reopens, we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace,
especially the quick service restaurants. To date, we have had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades
within DFAST category.
To finalize, let me also discuss the segments to which we are not exposed to. We do not have material credit
exposure to energy, airlines or shared national credits.
Turning to Slide number 11, we have continued to provide relief to our customer, through loan modifications,
either deferrals, forbearance or extensions. New requests for both loan modifications have declined 97% from
their peak in April. We have granted assistance to approximately 116,000 customer accounts, representing $3.9
billion of loans and 27% of total balance. Of the accounts modified, a significant percentage, 35% have continued
to make at least one payment while in the forbearance period.
Please turn to Slide number 12, to discuss credit metrics.
Non-performing assets decreased by $22 million to $881 million this quarter, mainly driven by an OREO decrease
of $10 million, coupled with a non-performing loan decrease of $8 million. The decrease in NPLs was in Puerto
Rico, driven by the mortgage and auto portfolio. The auto decrease was driven by the resumption of sales activity.
At the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 2.6% compared to 2.8% in the
previous quarter.
Please turn to Slide number 13 to discuss NPL inflows. Compared to the first quarter, NPL inflows, excluding
consumer loans, increased by $21 million, driven by increases of $9 million in the Puerto Rico commercial
portfolio and $7 million in the Puerto Rico mortgage portfolio. The increase in Puerto Rico commercial portfolio
was mainly driven by a single relationship, which will get more clarity on the behavior of NPL inflows in the third
quarter now that we have restarted collection activities that have been suspended since March. In the U.S.,
inflows to NPLs increased by $5 million mainly driven by higher mortgage inflows.
Turning to Slide number 14, net charge-off amounted to $65 million or our annualized 92 basis point of average
loans held-in-portfolio, compared to $63 million or 91 basis point in the previous quarter. The corporation
allowance for credit losses remained relatively flat from the prior quarter at $918 million. The ratio of allowance for
credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 3.2% in the second quarter compared to 3.3% in the prior quarter. The
ratio of the allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in portfolio was 121% compared to 120% in the first quarter.
The provision for credit losses decreased by $126 million, to $63 million, mainly driven by the pandemic's impact
on the macroeconomic scenarios.
Please turn to Slide number 15 to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses. We
adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Since implementation, our allowance for credit losses related to loans has
increased by $441 million or 92% driven by the day one adoption impact changes to microeconomic scenarios
and loan portfolio changes. At the end of the second quarter, the allowance for credit losses remained essentially

flat when compared to the first quarter of 2020. Variances were driven by the economic outlook, changes to
portfolio balances and portfolio credit quality.
In the first quarter, Popular opted to use the March 27 Moody's Analytics S3 scenario, which was more severe
than the Baseline scenario that Moody had at the time. We felt that the first quarter S3 scenario was more
representative of the economic forecast. For the second quarter, we used Moody's Baseline scenario. As we
believe, it has now caught up with what most economists are expecting, in terms of the impact of the pandemic.
Also, the start of economic variables is different from the first quarter S3 scenario, the magnitude of commodity
exchanges in variable is comparable to the Moody's second quarter Baseline scenario, which we use for our ACL
calculation. The change in macroeconomic scenario caused the ACL to decrease by $23 billion – $23 million.
As discussed by Carlos and Ignacio, portfolio balances increased by $1.4 billion, mainly driven by portfolios
insured by the U.S. government and thus have no ACL impact. Mainly PPP loans and [ph] GBMA loans (29:44)
subject to repurchase options. Excluding this, loan balances decreased by $287 million, driven by consumer
loans, causing a reduction in the ACL of $17 million. During the quarter, we downgraded approximately $190
million to substandard or worse. The downgrades, net charge-off and other changes to ACL caused the ACL to
increase by $103 million.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited stable credit quality metrics during the second quarter. However, the
effects of the pandemic continued to change and the full extent of economic disruption is uncertain. The
improvements, over the last few years, in the risk profile of our loan portfolio, position Popular, to successfully
operate under challenging environments. Management will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the
portfolios to pandemic-related risk, changes in economic outlook and how delinquencies and net charge-off
evolves after the period of payment deferral lapses.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates.
After 126 years in the banking business, we know success requires that we act quickly and decisively, putting
people first. I want to express my gratitude to our employees for their commitment to serve our customers and
their creativity and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing situation. We continue to support the communities we
serve through these difficult times by providing payment deferrals to more than 116,000 customers and also
provided assistance to healthcare professionals and non-profit organizations as they battle the pandemic.
I would also like to thank our customers for their continued trust and for adapting to this new reality. They have
accelerated their adoption of digital channels. Our market-leading digital offering in Puerto Rico helped us surpass
an important milestone, more than 1 million active users on a digital banking platform.
We are aware that there remains much uncertainty as to the future of the economy. Economic performance will
continue to be tied to developments on the health front, which are very difficult to predict. If the health situation
deteriorates, leading to a new round of restrictions on businesses, this will obviously hamper the economic
recovery. However, the strength of our balance sheet, levels of capital and liquidity, place us in a strong position
to continue to serve our clients and weather the challenges that may lie ahead.

We are now ready to answer your questions. Thank you.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And
today's first question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the decision to change your Moody's Scenario
that you used. I know you addressed that somewhat in your prepared marks that it looks like the total economic in
the new Baseline is a little worse but the recovery happens a lot earlier. I'm just curious as to why not stick with
the more of a double dip recession that you previously tapped?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Based on we were down during the first quarter scenarios, we feel that Moody's was playing catch-up. They have
not adjusted their scenarios rapidly enough to the rapidly changing situation. When we sat down for the second
quarter, as we mentioned, our view was different. I think, they have, for the most part, catch-up. And I will
categorize the second quarter scenario as being an elongated U-type of recovery, in which growth happens much
later in – our growth happen much later in 2021. I think, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, both I think the
scenarios are similar in terms of community impact to the main economic variables, also they pass different from
one to the other.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And on the deposit growths that you had, obviously some boost from the public deposits. But, in general,
the large level that has occurred, how much of that do you view as somewhat temporary, and you wouldn't be
able to really deploy that into higher earning assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, I think it's – obviously, we've had trouble predicting the public deposits in the past, so I've been fascinated to
predict how they're going to be deployed in the future. But generally we've seen a lot of liquidity in the system
from the federal stimulus payments. As opposed to like hurricane relief, many of these payments went directly to
people. So, between the $1,200 and the unemployment benefits, there's been a lot of liquidity going through the
system, the PPP loans put a lot of liquidity into the system.
It's hard for us to predict. Some of that money obviously will be spent. Some of it will come back with this and
goes off. I went – obviously when you consume things off island, I think it's very difficult yet for us to get a good
handle on those flows at this time so. And the return for taking a risk and going out longer is not very attractive at
this time. So, we're trying to get a better feel before we make fundamental changes in our investment approach.

Okay. And then lastly, the growth in card volume was pretty astounding in June. I think, you said it was up 42% or
43%.

Was that really just pent-up demand because of the lockdown? What was driving the really strong growth there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I mean it's hard to pin one thing. But obviously, there was pent-up demand. People were locked up in their
houses. I think we saw some of that in China, when in the first Coronavirus, when people who got out for the first
time, they started spending. Also, they got money in their pockets.
I mean, again, I don't want to underestimate. A lot of people in Puerto Rico, they were making minimum wage, or
close to minimum wage, were getting checks of $5,000 and $6,000...

... on unemployment. Yes, they were getting $600 a week. But they were getting – the checks were delayed, as in
many states. And by the time they got the checks, it was retroactive. They were really getting checks of $5,000,
something they would never have in their lives. So, a lot of money in the system, this pent-up demand, and I think
consumer demand picked up faster than we actually anticipated. People started going back to restaurants, to
stores, so we'll have to see how this recent surge affects there. But I think the consumer came back a lot faster
than I would have thought.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wondering maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the downgrades that you guys had during this
quarter and the reserve that was associated with them. And I guess what I'm trying to figure out is when you do
the downgrades, what assumptions were you making about the economy, were we already at the point where
things just starting to reopen, and the expectation was that they're going to remain opened, or is there a slightly
more pessimistic view taken, especially in some of like the hotels and the restaurants and some of the higher
downgraded buckets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I think, as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of the downgrades that we compared during the
quarter were in the – within the past category. However, having said that, there were certain segments in which
event information that we had available for us, given the prospect of the industry, we did downgrade to
substandard or worse. We mentioned that we downgraded about $200 million – $190 million to substandard or
worse.
As we always do, we take into account, how the company is doing, the prospect for the company, on a going-
forward basis, they are willing to withstand further disruption caused by the pandemic. But we are not making a
judgment in terms of the economic outlook. We think that things are pretty uncertain. But it's more based on the
current ability of the organization to withstand further crisis and the liquidity position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, one topic that I think a lot of us in the call have been following, and maybe
haven't gotten that much information on, is kind of this idea that pharmaceutical manufacturing, which is already a
huge part of the economy, in Puerto Rico, could grow even further, based on some repatriation of medical device
and pharmaceutical manufacturing away from other parts of the world.
On the ground, is there more that you can kind of give us in terms of sort of what's going on capacity in the space,
things like that that, or any other bills. I know we've seen one kind of circulating. Any other bills that are being
talked about, that could be helpful for people trying to figure out how much water [ph] that thesis can hold (39:44)?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Well, like you said, there's a number of bills going on in Congress, there's a number of people in the
Administration, who have proposed the idea of making Puerto Rico a source of pharmaceutical strength of the
U.S., this is a good opportunity for the island. I think that I believe that things have worked in our favor, but the
impact will be more gradual. I think that – I think we'll have a better chance of not losing new production lines and
bringing new production lines to Puerto Rico.
Obviously, with the concern about logistics and the continuing warfare with China is going to change the world.
So, the question is how much, and they're obviously going to be shifting production from China and other places
closer to the U.S., and I think some will be within the United States. I think Puerto Rico get a shot.
But most of what I've seen so far is anecdotal, except that, last week, or actually the beginning of this week, and
not in pharmaceutical, because I think you have to keep in mind, there's two things they're going to benefit from
this, the pharmaceutical and the medical device.
Medical devices are very important. People lump them together sometimes. It's a very important category.
CooperVision, which is a very large operation in the Southern part of the island, announced that it's going to make
a major expansion. So, that was announced at the beginning of the week. So, anecdotally, I've seen good things
like I really I don't have more concrete information to give you.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think our assumption I have is going to be that most of our clients are going to try to get the loan – from what
we've talked to our clients, most are going to go for 100% forgiveness. So, I think as soon as the SBA comes out
with clear guidelines how you do that, I think it's going to happen within the next, they've extended the period you
can use the funds to now 24 weeks. So, I think it'll happen by the third quarter – end of the year at least, I would
say end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes. It's a good [indiscernible] (42:30-42:31) significant part of the portfolio will be gone by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. So it's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Gladue Q
Analyst, Alden Securities
I know you've touched on it both in the prepared remarks and in some of the past questions. But the liquidity on
and deposits on the balance sheet, a lot of that is some of the PPP funds and such. Have you gotten any in the
last month or two? Any insight into, you know, just is that coming off gradually or do you think that's going to come
off more in chunks or yes, just any insight you might have so far into what you're seeing as how those funds are
being drawn down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. I'm not sure there is a lot of clarity, Joe. Some of the expenditures by the government will be in big chunks.
But what ends up happening with a lot of those big chunks is they move from a government account at the bank
to individual or corporate accounts at the banks. So, we do recapture some of that. So, while there may be a big
chunk of funds transferred in assistance, for example, by the government, you may not see the same effect of in
dropping in our overall deposits because they just move to other deposit accounts. So, it's hard to get a handle on
it. The government is taking a long time to actually start disbursing the assistance money. So, a lot of that money
is very new getting to people, in the last month or so. So, it's very early days. Hopefully, we'll have more clarity by
the end of third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I think a lot on the private deposit is going to depend also on what the new federal stimulus package looks
like. Lot of people have lot of liquidity. They have to start using that liquidity, and the unemployment benefits run
out, or go down substantially, or there's not a new PPP program, or it's not extended. The businesses that got that
liquidity will have to use it, and if there's not a replacement for it. So, I think a lot of it's also going to depend on
this next stimulus program.

Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good. Thanks.
Carlos, thank you for the detailed information on the NIM. Just, if I could follow-up, could you break out the part of
the NIM move that was attributed to rates, the excess liquidity and then the PPP loans this quarter, basically the
79-basis-point drop in the FTE? And also with respect to the PPP loans, given your prior comments like your
anticipation is that a 100% could be forgiven by the end of the year, what rate did you use on those loans for the
current quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
As far as breaking up, the drop, it's very hard to do Glen, because you have to make assumptions, as far as
where the additional funding or the new funding was invested. So, there's a gazillion assumptions we have to
make to answer your question, your very good question, intelligently, from our part.
We have taken a shot at that. And our estimate, at this point in time, is that roughly, big picture, two-thirds of the
drop in NIM was a result of change in mix and the increase in the balance sheet, and the other third roughly was
linked to rates or asset mix or other things. So, it's roughly two-third, one-third. Again, depending on your
assumptions, you can follow with different number, but that's the best we could do. As far as the PPP, the yield
that we have on this, it's $250 million...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, just qualitative, and maybe this is the big picture across the industry, but given the rapidity of the
moves from the Fed, do you think this cycle that NIMs reach trough levels a little bit sooner than they did in the
last cycle? And I know you gave – your guidance was for stable to maybe slightly up in the back half of the year
and some of that could be from PPP loans rolling off. But just like longer-term and maybe just qualitatively, I'd like
to hear your thoughts on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean that will really be a very bank-specific situation. For example, we have been, as we saw in the
results, we have been successful in moving our deposit costs down. But we, in an environment, like the one we
have, with significant uncertainty, we tend to be also cautious in the way that we're doing that. There may be other
banks that are being a lot more aggressive on the way they approach the reduction in deposit cost. So, that's one
consideration.
The other consideration depending on your deposit book, your – the lag, the effects – the lag in the – when the
dropping rates gets flowed through your deposit book may be different. Not all our deposit rates went down on
March 1. So, the full effect of the dropping rates will affect the part of the second quarter, not the whole second
quarter. So hopefully, we'll benefit from a bit more of that in the third quarter. So, very bank-specific, I would
assume, and that's within – by the end of the third quarter, most people will have seen a lot of the effects. In our
case, as we know, the name varies more because of all the things like asset mix and deposit levels and it does
because of rate. So, in our case, there may be the drivers are somewhat different.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then if I may just one – one for Lidio. Thank you for the information on the deferrals.
I noticed in the press release that you said deferrals were going to start to roll off in July through September. I
guess we're a month through July now. What are you seeing on re-deferral rates from customers? And also,
maybe, if you could just highlight some of the differences in deferral policies, on the island, versus those on the
mainland?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I will say a couple of things. The first thing you asked, I mean I don't have up-to-date information to provide you in
terms of re-deferral rates for some of our customers. We'll provide details to the market on our next webcast.
In terms of some of the differences, I think, to a certain extent, there are two things that I will say. I mean we have
gone through crisis in the past, and we have offered deferral programs to customers to the whole island before,
so they are used to having deferral programs and taking advantage of it.
The other item that I will say, particularly related to our commercial portfolio, in the U.S. banking industry, you
have seen a lot of land utilization as part of our customer liquidity strategies. In Puerto Rico, we haven't really
seen that. What they have done is they use deferral programs, as part of their liquidity strategy. So, while they're
hitting the line, they have used deferrals to just keep cash within their operation.

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I would add that on the -this is Ignacio. I would add that on the consumer front, as opposed to most U.S.
jurisdictions, in Puerto Rico, there were mandated deferrals for consumer products beyond mortgage. I know
some jurisdictions had mortgage relief in the Cares Act. That was again mortgage relief. But basically, in Puerto
Rico, we had mandated moratoriums and deferrals for all consumer products, all that client had to do was
basically state that he had been impacted by the pandemic with no further evidence. So that's a major substantive
difference.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Good. A couple of questions, clearly you talked about the outlook on the Moody's economic forecast, which of
course influences the provision for loan losses particularly with CECL now. If we continue to see a stable outlook
for the economy, according to Moody's, and whatever you adjust for your own overlay, should the provision for
loan losses essentially then be just the provisions you need for maybe some re-ratings that go on within the
portfolio, and loan growth. And therefore, we won't possibly see elevated provisions going forward.

Assuming, and that is a big assumption, a stable economic forecast, I think what you said makes sense, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

Okay. Now I know that's a big assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A

Yes. It would be loan growth charge-offs [ph] and taken mix (53:13) and downgrade.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

But the charge-offs you wouldn't have to replace since you've already say – assuming they go according to your

Only [ph] regarding the book in standby (53:24).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, second question was, in the deferral programs that you guys gave us the detail on, when you
look at the non-essential retail and hotel properties that are in deferral, what's the typical loan-to-value for those
types of properties?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I will say I mean we typically underwrite loans to 70% loan-to-value, 75% loan-to-value. Guessing value today, I
don't know. I don't – so, it's difficult for me to tell you what are the current loan-to-values because I don't know
what is the value equation today. But typically, we underwrite to 70% loan-to-value, 75% loan-to-value.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I see. And then, lastly, I don't know if you guys have talked to the New York Fed, but do you get any sense from
the Fed when they're support of the deferral programs where you don't have to reclassify those loans, when that
support will be eliminated, any idea when that may happen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
They haven't – they haven't communicated. I think their communications are basically the industry-wide
communications that they've given out. I think they've been the – I think they've been pretty open to and clear that
you have to help customers within the reasonable and prudent parameters. I don't see any pressure coming from
the Fed in that area.

I see. And then, just as a follow-up to that, through the end of the year, when the accountants have to sign off on
SEC documents, if the deferral program is still in place for all the banks, not just you guys, and the Fed is still
supportive, is there any potential kind of conflicts with the accountants in the SEC versus the regulators on
deferral loans?

Jorge J. García A
Principal Accounting Officer, SVP & Comptroller, Popular, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. This is Jorge García. I mean the regulators and the SEC have kind of come together in adding
clarity, haven't suspended any of the accounting rules, so we're still subject to evaluating the TBRs, etcetera, and
that's really where you would, you know, that's the risk, so where you have to classify this as triple debt
restructuring. But I don't expect the conflict. I think the information that's out there now is just converging and
clarifying how to apply it. And certainly, we're complying with that.

Yes.

And again, the deferral programs are not being generally extended to the end of the year. They have come to an
end. Obviously, the CARES Act is federally mandated for mortgages, and we'll follow that.

Right.

But other than the CARES Act, most broad uniform deferral programs have now expired.
