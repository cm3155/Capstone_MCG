Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone.
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $184 million, or $1.33 per share, exceeding expectations across
most line items. Strong customer activity drove higher average deposits, which offset the impact of lower loans
and helped net interest income outperform guidance for the quarter. The downward shift in the rate curve resulted
in a meaningful improvement in AOCI, contributing to 23% growth in tangible book value.
Credit quality remained solid, reflecting our prudent underwriting discipline as net charge-offs remained
historically low. While customer sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the initial decline in rates was well-
received, as select businesses showed early signs of an uptick in activity nearing quarter end. However, to see a
more significant shift in behavior and reinvestment, we believe customers are looking for further rate reductions,
confirmation of a soft landing, and getting past the impending election.
Before we get into more detail on our strong quarter, I wanted to take a moment to touch on the historical
milestone we celebrated on August 17, Comerica's 175th anniversary. My leadership team and I have spent a lot

of time this past quarter visiting our markets, meeting with customers, colleagues, and community leaders. We
have a great story and a value proposition that resonates with our target market. Our customers trust us with their
business, and we take that responsibility seriously.
As a bank, we have successfully navigated industry changes, global conflicts, and economic cycles over many
years. We feel this impressive history underscores the strength of our unique model, and we believe our
consistent execution, along with our strategic investments, position us to successfully support our customers now
and into the future.
Moving back to results, third quarter financial highlights are on slide 4. High inflation and elevated rates continued
to pressure loan demand, but we saw positive momentum in deposits as average balances grew in most of our
businesses. Excluding the impact of BSBY cessation, net interest income increased 1.3% over the second quarter
trough. Charge-offs of 8 basis points remained below historical averages and even declined slightly from last
quarter's already strong results.
Lower non-customer income offset favorable trends in customer-related fees, and non-interest expenses were
well-managed. We continue to favor conservative approach to capital, with our estimated CET1 increasing further
to 11.97%, well above our 10% strategic target. Jim will discuss our capital management strategy later in his
presentation. In all, it was a great quarter with positive momentum moving into the end of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our third quarter financial results in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to loans on slide 5, we saw some reversal over the growth signals from the second quarter, with loans
coming down in August, but we're encouraged to see balances relatively flat in September. Most of the decline in
average loans was in National Dealer Services and Corporate Banking. Dealers saw elevated balances in the
second quarter related to the cyberattack that impacted the industry. As we look at dealer trends month to month,
balances were most pressured early in the quarter and September saw more positive activity.
Corporate Banking, specifically US banking, saw more relative pressure than other businesses as we focus on
maintaining our pricing discipline and return targets. Additionally, soft loan demand across the industry caused
some bank group consolidation. US banking saw an improvement late in the quarter and period-end loans were
relatively flat to June 30.
Moving to businesses that grew, Commercial Real Estate utilization increased, which was a continuation of the
trend we have seen in this elevated rate environment. However, as rates come down, we expect to see an uptick
in the pace of payoffs, as projects sell or refinance into the permanent market as intended.
Growth in Environmental Services was attributed to our renewables focus. In 2022, we formed a new renewables
team, and we have seen strong results. Environmental Services overall is a great business for us, and we feel our
distinguished talent and unique expertise have allowed us to carve out a leading position in this niche industry.
Touching briefly on loan yields, lower non-accrual interest was the main driver of the 8 bps decline, and we saw
only a minor drag from lower short-term rates in the quarter.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
On slide 6, we were encouraged by customer deposit activity. Average deposits increased 1.3% with growth
across most business lines. Average third quarter brokered time deposits were higher due to activity late in the
second quarter. However, favorable customer deposit trends allowed us to repay almost $900 million in brokered
CDs by the end of the third quarter. Despite that deliberate reduction in brokered CDs, we grew total period-end
deposits by over $600 million.
As we win new and expand existing relationships, we continue to see the elevated rate environment drive
customers to bring those deposits into interest bearing accounts. Despite continued modest cyclical pressure on
non-interest-bearing balances, they performed in line with our expectations and remain favorable at 38% of total
deposits.
We took steps to adjust pricing as the Fed began to cut rates. We plan to continue monitoring the competitive
environment as we manage ongoing deposit pricing alongside additional rate cuts in the future. With our strong
relationship model, we feel well-positioned to strike the right balance between our customer's objectives with their
own funding needs and profitability.
Our securities portfolio on slide 7 benefited from the shift in the rate curve, as we saw a 24% improvement in our
valuation adjustment in the quarter. This favorable mark-to-market impact more than offset repayments and
maturities and drove a net $130 million increase in the portfolio. We continue to believe the expected repayment
and maturities of this portfolio will enhance earnings in the coming quarters, even if we resume investment at
some point in 2025.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income increased $1 million to $534 million. Excluding the impact of the BSBY
cessation, net interest income would have grown $7 million quarter-over-quarter. The shift in the rate curve
allowed us to reallocate cash collateral from the CME to the Fed, benefiting net interest income. That, coupled
with strong customer deposits, which allowed us to pay down wholesale funding, and the benefit of maturing
swaps and securities, offset pressures from BSBY cessation, lower loans, and noninterest-bearing deposit
balances.
As shown on slide 9, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet
has made us slightly liability-sensitive and allows us to better protect our profitability from a declining rate
environment. By strategically managing our swap and securities portfolio, while considering balance sheet
dynamics, we intend to maintain our insulated position over time.
We feel credit quality remains a competitive strength as our overall trends in the third quarter remain solid and
relatively unchanged from the second quarter, as shown on slide 10. Net charge-offs remain low at 8 bps,
criticized loans were essentially flat, and non-performing assets remained well below historical averages. The
overall economic outlook was also relatively unchanged, but lower average loans, especially in lower-risk
portfolios, drove an increase in the allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of total loans.
Even though our portfolio remains strong, we have potential for even further improvement if lower rates
materialize and inflationary pressures abate. Regardless, we feel our proven conservative credit discipline
continues to position us well to outperform peers through the cycle.
On slide 11, third quarter non-interest income of $277 million decreased $14 million from the second quarter,
primarily due to non-customer related income. Changes in the value related to our Visa B derivative drove a
negative $11 million variance, as we recognized a $5 million loss in the third quarter compared to a $6 million gain
in the second quarter.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Risk management hedging income declined $10 million, as the lower rate curve reduced the amount of required
collateral held at the CME. While this resulted in a decline in non-interest income, part of this benefited net
interest income. We saw encouraging trends in several customer-related categories with increased syndication
fees, derivative income, commercial lending fees, and a small increase in commercial service charges. Fiduciary
income was down, but excluding the $3 million seasonal tax-related benefit in the second quarter, it would have
been up consistent with improved market performance. We continue to be encouraged by the progress in
targeted initiatives designed to further enhance non-interest income.
Expenses on slide 12 increased $7 million over the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits were up $12 million, which
included a $4 million increase in deferred compensation, which was mostly offset within non-interest income and
various other smaller increases. FDIC expenses declined by $8 million, partially due to a $4 million favorable
accrual adjustment in the third quarter, compared to a $3 million expense in the second quarter, both related to
the special assessment. In all, we feel expenses were well-controlled, and we continue to prioritize opportunities
to drive positive operating leverage and improve efficiency.
As shown on slide 13, our already strong capital position improved further in the third quarter. Solid profitability,
lower loans and conservative capital management drove our estimated CET1 to 11.97%. Adjusting for the AOCI
opt-out, our estimated CET1 would have been 9.12%, which is well above required regulatory minimums and
buffers. Movement in the forward curve, coupled with ongoing repayments and maturities in our securities
portfolio, resulted in a 32% improvement in AOCI, increasing our tangible common equity ratio by over 150 basis
points.
Considering our compelling estimated CET1, well in excess of our strategic target, and the favorable movement in
the rate curve, we plan to utilize a portion of our excess capital to repurchase $100 million of our common stock
shares starting in the fourth quarter. Allocating capital to support our customers' loan needs always remains our
first priority. So, we intend to be measured in our approach and calibrate the size and frequency of future
repurchases with expected loan trends. We will also continue to closely watch the forward curve, our profitability,
the broader economic environment, and any regulatory updates as they may also influence our strategy.
Moving to slide 14, we do not yet have any meaningful update regarding the timing or specifics of the transition of
the Direct Express program. As a reminder, our current contract allows Fiscal Service to utilize up to a three-year
extension under our current terms. Fiscal Service would need to notify us of their intention to extend no later than
early December, so we expect to hear more before the end of the year.
However, our expectation of the timing of deposit transition has not changed. Based on the size, complexity and
critical nature of this program, our experience leads us to believe this transition may be longer rather than shorter.
We do not anticipate an impact to 2024 deposit balances, non-interest income, or expenses. In fact, it is possible
we may not see a significant impact to average deposit balances in 2025, although we need more information on
the proposed transition plan to confirm.
In the meantime, we plan to continue prioritizing targeted deposit strategies aligned with our core relationship
operating model to further enhance our funding position and prepare for an eventual transition.
Our outlook for 2024 is on slide 15. We project 2024 average loans to be 5% lower than 2023. Muted demand,
which we feel has been consistent across the industry and our deliberate optimization efforts in the latter half of
2023 are the major drivers for this decline. With some customer optimism following the third quarter rate cuts and
normal seasonal patterns, we anticipate modest, broad-based growth in the fourth quarter.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
One of the bigger variables will be our Commercial Real Estate business, as we believe loan balances in this
business may have peaked. Depending on the pace and size of further rate cuts, we could see a more rapid
reduction in balances than projected in that business. Full-year average deposits are projected to be down 3% to
4% from 2023. The slight reduction relative to last quarter's guidance is driven by the expectation of an
approximate $1 billion decline in year-over-year brokered time deposits, not customer-related trends. Further
reductions in brokered time deposits are also driving the projected 2% decline in average deposits in the fourth
quarter, as fourth quarter customer deposits are projected to remain relatively flat.
Although we're projecting some level of modest fourth quarter seasonality, third quarter averages were elevated
by large temporary customer deposits, which were distributed by quarter-end as expected. Based on the high-
interest rate environment, we project deposit growth to continue to be concentrated in interest bearing accounts,
but we still expect to maintain a favorable deposit mix in the upper 30% range.
We expect full-year 2024 net interest income to decline 13% to 14% compared to 2023. The slight improvement
relative to prior guidance is a result of our strong third quarter results. Fourth quarter net interest income is
expected to grow 6% over the third quarter, or 1% to 2% adjusting for the impact of BSBY cessation. We expect
noninterest-bearing deposit pressures to be more than offset by benefits from swaps, securities and the forward
curve. However, we continue to watch noninterest-bearing balances and overall pricing dynamics as they could
impact results.
Credit quality remains strong, as we produce another quarter of low net charge-offs. Interest rates remain
elevated, and as customers continue to navigate high borrowing costs and inflationary pressures, we believe
modest, manageable migration will continue. However, given our strong results today, we forecast full-year net
charge-offs to remain well below our normal 20- to 40-basis-point range.
We expect non-interest income to be flat year-over-year or down 2% to 3% when adjusting for BSBY and the
impact of the Ameriprise transition. This reflects a modest reduction in prior guidance due to trends in risk
management hedging income. Although the lower forward curve benefited AOCI and net interest income, it does
pressure this line item.
Fourth quarter non-interest income is projected to decline 1% to 2% relative to the third quarter, also driven by
lower risk management hedging income. Despite this and other non-customer related pressures, we continue to
be encouraged by customer-related fee income trends. Full-year non-interest expenses are expected to decline
2% to 3% on a reported basis and grow 4% after adjusting for special FDIC assessments, expense recalibration,
modernization, and the impact from the Ameriprise transition.
Fourth quarter expenses are projected to increase 3% over our strong third quarter results, or 4% on an adjusted
basis as detailed on the slide. Expense discipline remains a priority as we work towards our objective of positive
operating leverage. Even with modest projected loan growth in the fourth quarter and the resumption of share
repurchases, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain well above our 10% strategic target through year-end. In all, we
expect a solid fourth quarter, which would set us up nicely for a strong start to 2025.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
This was an important quarter. As an industry, we saw the Fed take their first steps away from a higher-for-longer
rate environment. For Comerica, the actions we took to deliberately minimize our natural asset sensitivity position
allow us to better protect our net interest income from lower rates. Additionally, rate declines should be a net
positive for credit quality and loans, as customer profitability improves and they resume investing in their
businesses. Coupling those tailwinds with our disciplined approach to credit and expenses, along with the
redemption of share repurchases, creates what we believe to be positive momentum for generating compelling
returns over time.
We appreciate your time this morning. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning. So, I wanted to dig in on deposits. The average deposit rates went up a little
bit this quarter. I think in the prepared remarks, you noted that there were some brokered time deposits that were
higher early in the quarter that you paid down. So, maybe if you can expand on what drove those overall average
interest-bearing deposit rates higher. And if you have it, what the spot deposit costs are as of September 30 or
October 15, whatever you have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Manan. It's Jim. Thanks for the question. We were really encouraged by the success we had in
interest-bearing deposits in the third quarter. On average, they were up $1.5 billion, and notably, on an ending
basis, they were up $2.2 billion. Now we know $300 million of that was brokered, but, overall, just really great
success in gathering interest-bearing deposits.
So, I will say, in the higher-for-longer environment that we experienced through mid to late September, I mean,
increasing pay rates has been somewhat of a common trend in the industry, including Comerica. You couple onto
that the fact that we had such great success in bringing in these deposits, which, by the way, were very
intentional. We've been really successful in paying down wholesale funding in the last few quarters. That trend
continues with brokered deposits being reduced, both this quarter and next quarter. And we're very happy to have
those core interest bearing deposits, even if we had to pay up just a little bit.
So, I feel like the 8-bp increase we had on a quarter-to-quarter basis was really in line, not just with the industry,
but well in line with our intentions and our goal of just raising strong core customer deposits. So, it's something we
just felt really good about and think it's a great value proposition.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And any indication on how deposit costs have [ph] had trajected (22:42) since the Fed rate cut?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, we are really projecting very closely to what we've been planning all along. I will say the spot rate at the
end of the quarter was maybe slightly lower than the month before, as we started to see success with our pricing
strategy. Overall, [indiscernible] (23:06) trended up a little bit as the quarter went on. I'm always hesitant to give a
very spot rate on a given day because it does move around a little bit.
But I will say that we are having success with our repricing. A lot of work went into this, a lot of strategy. I'm really
proud of our product managers for what they put together, not just in terms of what we're repricing, but just some
of the product designs they've done to make sure that we have mix shifts that are mutually beneficial to both us
and our customers. But there will be a lot of moving parts and maybe just looking forward to the fourth quarter,
because I know that's really what you're interested in.
The success we had in repricing deposits, I think, really approached on a product basis, something approaching
our cumulative beta just north of 60%. So, really happy about that. But, of course, a number of other things are
going on. We are bringing in core deposits and being very successful in that, and that puts a little pressure on the
overall beta as we look to from third quarter to fourth quarter. We do have a little bit of mix shift going on. We do
continue to survey both our customer reaction as well as the competition and what they're doing. And as I
mentioned, just a little higher jumping-off point maybe at the end of the quarter than perhaps on average prior to
that FOMC cut.
So, if you put all that together, and there's a lot going on there, a lot of variables, I do think when we get to the
fourth quarter, you're going to see an overall beta relative to average FOMC rate changes probably hovering
somewhere between our standard beta of 47% and that cumulative beta that we had just north of 60%. So, that's
something we're really pleased about. But I will say, a lot of moving parts, a lot of mix shifts, again, by design on
our part as well as our customers. So, it's something we're just going to have to continue to monitor, but so far, a
pretty successful outcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And do you think betas from there, as we think – as we look out into 2025, what's your best guess on
whether deposit betas accelerate from there, because we get through more rate cuts, or do they roughly stay the
same because, I guess, loan growth could be improving next year? Maybe help us with how you're thinking
through that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
First of all, I would say the rate of cuts always depends on what kind of landing we have. I've been very consistent
in saying that. And it does look like we're going to have a soft landing, which I think puts a little pressure on the
pace of betas, because it's always easier to change rates when there's perhaps a little more fear in the economy,
which typically does a company a rate reduction.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
But the way I look at it is we're starting from a strong position. There are probably some mid-tier rates that we're
hesitant to move down at this point. So, I think the betas will pick up a little pace as we start to move through mid
2025, late 2025. I think they will accelerate a little bit, and then they'll probably back off as some of those rates
start to approach a floor and you need to pull back a little bit. So, it'll be a little bit of a U-shaped curve, I suspect,
for the industry. But, again, a lot of it's going to depend on just what happens in the overall economy and what
type of landing the economy has.

Good morning, John.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Good morning. On net interest income, it's good to see the upside guide, despite the lower deposit
growth expectation and your lower loan growth expectation. And I know you mentioned a lot of that is partly given
the third quarter performance. And your fourth quarter expectation on NII, the 6% or the 1% to 2% up ex-BSBY, is
noted given that.
Curious, if loan demand remains relatively modest and you still see some continued competitive pressures around
deposit pricing, how do you see NII trajecting beyond the fourth quarter? I know looking out there, it looks like
expectations could be in the mid to high-single-digit growth for net interest income as we look into 2025. Do you
think that is reasonable if you've got some slower rebound in loan growth as we move into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, John. It's Jim. I'm happy to take that question. Overall, we're pretty bullish about net interest
income in 2025. It does look like we hit an inflection point in the second quarter of this year, that's even with a little
bit of BSBY drag in the third quarter. So, really pleased with how that's trending. I would say, as I've been saying,
I think the overall trend quarter to quarter to quarter, beyond where we're at now is going to be up. There could
always be some anomalous quarter, whether it has to do with the timing of FOMC reductions or day count or
whatever, you could always have a quarter where maybe it starts to plateau a little bit.
But I think the general trend is going to be just continuously increasing net interest income as we move beyond
2024. So, that's something we're really looking forward to. We do expect loan growth on a somewhat continuous
basis in 2025, so that will be helpful also. I will say we're not ready to give guidance for 2025, so I'm hesitant to

quote any specific loan growth numbers or net interest income numbers. But I would say overall, it's a pretty nice
picture in terms of just ever-increasing net interest income as we move through the next, not just few quarters, but
few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Great. Thanks, Jim. Very helpful. And then, separately on – if I could skip over to capital, your CET1 of just shy of
12% versus your 10% target is certainly noted. And I know you expect the resumption in buybacks of about $100
million in the fourth quarter. Maybe could you give us at least a trajectory on how you feel about the possible
acceleration of buybacks as you go through 2025, just given that type of margin, where you're running right now
above your target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I don't think we're prepared yet to talk about 2025. We do acknowledge that we're carrying very strong levels of
capital. Now, we do want to stay materially above our 10% target of CET1. And frankly, I think we want to stay
above probably an 11% – well above an 11% CET1 target, because we want to make sure we're ready for Basel
III end game as it approaches, even though those rules are not quite final yet.
But that still does give us a little bit of flexibility. So, we expect earnings to continue to be very strong going
forward. But we do have to, as always, continue to make sure we prioritize capital for loan growth and our
customers. We have to keep an eye on rates in the overall economic environment, longer term rates and the
curve shift up a little bit since the end of the quarter.
And again, we are sensitive to what's going on with AOCI and making sure that we don't get a surprise there. We
continue to monitor just profitability in the regulatory environment. So, it's just something we're going to have to
monitor on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we move through 2025. But we do feel very comfortable with our capital
position and really proud of the fact that we're starting the share repurchase this quarter.

Good morning, Jon.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Jim, maybe bigger picture for you. Can you just talk a little bit about your philosophy on
hedging right now and your approach to rate management? It feels like there's a better outcome on NII and the
margin if rates fall further. But just talk a little bit about what you're trying to accomplish and how we should think
about NII trajectory and margin trajectory if the Fed continues cutting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Jon. Yeah, as you see at our sensitivity slide in the deck, we are just very slightly liability-sensitive.
Actually, a little less liability-sensitive than last quarter, but still slightly liability-sensitive. I've been saying that I
really think of us as largely interest-neutral. There's always a somewhat of a fixed component of that sensitivity
equation that ties back to balances in the assumption that noninterest-bearing balances will grow if rates continue
to go down. And we may not get the full effect of that until we see a few more rate cuts and we had some type of
inflection point in terms of how customers manage their money. And so, I don't necessarily expect to get the full
benefit of that balance until we get a few more cuts down the road.
So, as a result, from a pure rate standpoint, I really think of us as being closer to interest neutral, and eventually,
we'll get the balanced benefit of that liability sensitivity also. And so, I don't see the rate picture really changing
things materially for us on a quarter-to-quarter basis because we are so close to neutral. And I think the real
wildcard really for us is going to be deposit pay rates, how competition and the customers react. I think that's
probably got a wider range of outcome than what you might argue in terms of asset and liability sensitivity
assumptions. So, much closer to interest neutral. The good news is I feel like we are insulated from any drop in
rates and should be protected from that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And it feels like you're starting to get the early signs of maybe a little bit of customer acceptance to lower
deposit rates. Is that a fair assessment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, yeah, I think so. We feel – and Peter may want to comment, too. But I've been really pleased with how it's
received and our relationship managers are doing a great job shepherding these through and explaining to the
customers. And I'll give credit to our customers. They understand it. And when they ask for rate increases, as
rates were going up and I think they understand that when rates go down, we have to be a little bit symmetrical
there. And so, overall, I feel like it's going really well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Jon, it's Peter. I would echo that. We feel like it's going really well, and we're being very selective across each of
our businesses. I mean, some of them we can achieve more success than others. But, I think, our continuous [ph]
messages (33:58) about our relationship strategy and being able to have these conversations before our
customers make moves is proving to be very successful. So, I would echo what Jim's comments are there.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. And then, just one kind of a follow-up on John's question on loan growth. But you talked – you guys
flagged a couple of times CRE payoffs and maybe an uptick in CRE payoffs. But on the flip side, maybe some
better potential lending growth if rates do fall. How do you kind of square that? How material do you think the CRE
payoffs might be? And this kind of gets to the 2025 loan growth question, but is that just a real impediment to
2025 growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Jon, it's Peter. It's certainly something we're watching. I think it's yet to be determined of how much of a
headwind it is or isn't. I would say, we feel like CRE loans have peaked in the third quarter here. And so, it
probably is sort of a downward slope as we get into next year. Now, that said, I think we feel like the rest of the
portfolio will perform in the opposite direction and hopefully be able to offset that headwind. So, we'll talk more
about 2025 outlook when we talk about our next call. But at least as we sit today, I think CRE is probably a
downward slope from here on and our expectation is, with rates coming down further, sort of, where we feel like
the rest of the portfolio maybe has bottomed a little bit, that'll hopefully offset the headwind on CRE.

Hey, guys. Good morning. So, just a quick question, modeling question on the risk management hedge income,
given the geography change. So, is there a rule of thumb on how much risk management income would decline
and net II increase on a 25 basis points rate cut?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Bernard. I don't necessarily have a rule of thumb for you, but you could probably look at how
three- to five-year treasuries move this quarter and draw a little bit of a conclusion relative to the previous quarter.
We said it's tied to our swaps, and our swaps do have a much shorter duration than our bond portfolio. But we did
see a shift of income, as we mentioned in the script, from non-interest income to net interest income. You see that

on the non-interest income slide, risk management hedge income was down $10 million. Net interest income
probably benefited from $8 million of that in the third quarter. And net interest income will continue to benefit from
that in the fourth quarter.
So, we do have some positive inflows in the net interest income, and I think on the strength of those, we did
improve our outlook reflecting in part the great third quarter success. And I do think as I look to that down 13% to
14% guide, I do think we have a really good shot at being closer to the 13% than the 14%. So, we continue to
look at really strong net interest income, and I think that explains some of the weakness in the non-customer
portion on the non-interest income side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Got it. And then, just separately, I appreciate that the forward curve has changed. It feels like it's ebbed and
flowed just even day by day. But on slide 7 of the deck, you estimate the securities AOCI unrealized losses
declined by, I think it's about 16% by 1Q 2026. The footnote, I believe, it's the forward curve at 9/30. And given
changes in the forward curve since then, there's like two less rate cuts priced in. Just wondering, any idea of the
impact from just higher forward curve versus the 9/30 that I believe is assumed in that assessment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
It's been moving around quite a bit. 9/30, trending up somewhat. So, I don't really have a number for you as to
where it sits today. We do have some sensitivities on the capital slide that point to overall AOCI and a large
portion of that, the vast majority of that relates to bonds. So, that's a little bit of a harbinger that you can look out
there. But, overall, we'll just have to wait and see where rates end up in the fourth quarter.

Just kind of high level, a little more philosophical than anything. So, you guys stuck your neck out a little bit this
year in terms of loan growth expectations, and pleased, by no means, I feel like I'm picking on you because
everyone seemed to and everyone seemed to walk it back a bit just because you have a little bit more of a
national and commercial footprint than most of my coverage, I'd say, on average.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
When you think about kind of the impediments, why is loan demand really wasn't there? And is there anything that
stood out, [ph] is it (39:23) other than just lack of rate cuts? And then, kind of as we go into next year, I mean,
does political uncertainty actually fix anything, or is there kind of inflection points on rates where you might see
demand? Just kind of your thoughts on what you're hearing from boots on the ground level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Ben, it's Peter. It's a really good question. I don't know that my story is any more compelling than maybe
some of the other things that you're hearing. But I think I would probably say that we all felt like some interest rate
relief would really drive loan demand, and I think that's kind of proven to be not necessarily the case. So, the
feedback we're getting from our portfolio was that 50 basis points was nice but not inspiring necessarily. And that,
really, I think, what most of the economies going to need to see is another 50 basis points to 100 basis points to
really see some stimulation there. So, we certainly were feeling earlier in the year that the second half of 2024, we
would start to see loan demand pick up and that really hasn't occurred.
So, what does that mean for going into the future? I think that probably it does become a little more of even a
second half of 2025 conversation about what does loan demand look like in the economy. And certainly, getting to
the other side of the election, I think, will be helpful because I do believe that business owners wait to make
decisions until they understand what the tax outlook might look like for them, I think, to Jim's point, continuing to
see the economy kind of level out here.
But I don't know that there's anything more compelling other than to tell you that what we are hearing is that
interest rates are going to need to come down probably another 50 basis points to 100 basis points to really start
to inspire business owners to make more decisions here on investing capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. I mean, some clarity on the political front, whether team red or team blue, it definitely
helped. But I get what you're saying, it's kind of more of just lack of animal spirits across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
But if you do – if you did kind of have to rank order, are there certain areas that kind of might be chomping up a
bit, like economically speaking, that seem to probably want to take on a little bit faster? Or anything that comes to
mind that might be kind of first out of the gate to increase loan demand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Ben, when you look at our portfolio, I would say, our national and specialty businesses have probably started to
see a little bit more pick up across the board. Our pipeline feel like it actually has grown a little bit more in those
businesses in the last quarter. I think it's really more general middle market C&I, where you're just going to have
to have that reduction in interest rates to get the stimulant of borrowing.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
And to your comment about animal spirits, I think your average middle market business in the country right now is
just waiting for that interest rate relief. So, they're not in a situation where they have to do anything. If anything,
they're building a little bit of cash. They're making good money. Why take any chances when they believe that the
outlook on interest rates is really going to be in their favor next year?
On the other hand, our national specialty businesses, I think, they're going to kind of run their businesses, I want
to say, despite interest rates, but we are seeing some pick up there. And so, that's where I think you put all that
together between sort of muted Middle Market growth, CRE coming down, and some of our other specialty
businesses picking up, that's kind of where you're hearing us talk about sort of modest to flat loan growth going
into the fourth quarter and possibly next year.

Hi. Good morning. Jim, just wanted to get a better just understanding of the guide for Q4 for NII. The plus 6%, or
the plus 1% to 2%, the GAAP was $534 million in the third quarter. Is the math 6% off of that? I'm just trying to
make sure I got the right NII for the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
It is. Yeah. It's the printed number 6% above that. BSBY, obviously, has about a $25 million swing. If you look at
the BSBY schedule that we have from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and again, that schedule's in the
deck. But, yeah, it is 6% on the printed number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I think there is a little bit of opportunity with ECRs as rates continue to come down. Our ECR has actually had a
much lower beta than our deposits did. So, I do expect service charges to benefit over time as rates continue to
come down, and I think it'll be noticeable, but I don't think it'll be huge. It'll be really just a fraction of what you're
going to get on the pure deposit pay rate side.

Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask if you can put a maybe a finer point on the margin in 4Q. I understand
that you're looking to pay down some of the brokered deposits. But just wanted to get a sense for, I guess, a finer
point on how you're managing that extra liquidity and what your level of willingness is to move cash flow or move
brokered lower and sort of protect the margin a bit more.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Hey. Good morning, Samuel. We do expect the balance sheet to become a little bit more efficient as we move
into the fourth quarter. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we will see a little bit lower wholesale funding on average.
Brokered deposits are where you're going to see the biggest change, as we pay down quite a few, almost $900
million at the end of the third quarter and a somewhat similar amount as we move through the fourth quarter. So,
we did inflate the balance sheet a little bit with excess cash supported by those higher level of brokered deposits
because, frankly, the loan growth that we might have expected at one time when we took those brokered deposits
out didn't fully materialize.
And so, I will say that we expect improvement in the NIM, as we move into the fourth quarter. I think many of you
know on the call that I really hate talking about NIM and I think, yet again, we have another example where net
interest income increased even with the BSBY drag, yet the NIM went down because of dynamics of the balance
sheet.
So, never really like to talk a lot about NIM percentage. Having said that, it is going to move up materially just
because of a more efficient balance sheet and probably end up somewhere near 3-handle, 3% as we move
through the fourth quarter. But a lot of that will just depend on just the various levers within the balance sheet and
how they move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Thanks for the color there, Jim. And then, the other question I had is just around the Environmental
Services teams that you have. And obviously, you're pretty bullish just on the opportunity set here. So, can you
talk a little bit more about the business in terms of the growth ramp with the teams that you have and what your
expectations might be over the next couple of years in terms of where that business can go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Sam, this is Peter. So, it is a business that we're very proud of. We've been at this business for a long time
now. A couple of years ago, we started a renewables group as well that shows up in that line item. And quite
candidly, our Environmental Services business has been a quarterly positive performer for several years now.
And I think that outlook will continue. We've got a great team. I think we're the best in the business. We continue
to try to give resources to those folks.
So, I'd be surprised to see anything other than the pace that you've seen the last few years continue in that
space. It's a fantastic – it's really a great middle market business. It's a specialty business. But the size of the
loans, the fee income that it generates, it's just a fantastic business for us. And so, it's one that we're going to
continue to lean into and I would expect that on a go-forward basis, the growth rates would be similar to what
you've seen in the last few years. So, that's how I would think about it that way if I were you.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Hey. Good morning. I think all but the NIM and the loan growth questions have been asked, so maybe I'll ask
on just the pace of future investments, specifically as it relates to loan hires. I think we're hearing more
commentary across other banks that hiring efforts are going to be a little bit more robust as we enter next year. I
wanted to get your thoughts there to maybe drive some incremental loan growth. And then, maybe any sort of
update you have just in terms of costs related to eventually crossing the $100 billion in assets. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Michael, it's Peter. I might take the first one, and then I'll probably let Jim take the second one. I think the thing
that – you're exactly right, the competition for talent is tremendous right now. I think whether you're – no matter
which market we're in, no matter what kind of line of business you look at, there's a lot of competition for talent.
I continue to believe that something that makes us very special is we have a fantastic training program, where a
lot of our relationship manager growth over the next few years is because of talent that we have hired and trained
and developed. And they go to market with that sort of culture and expectation, and I think a better knowledge of
credit than our peers. And so, that program is one that we're leaning heavily into of trying to get folks into that
program and out of it as well-trained and ready to be successful as we possibly can.
I think hiring from other banks can be successful, but I also think it's expensive and I don't think it's necessarily the
best way to grow your culture or your brand. So, I think that distinguishes us when you look at Comerica from
others as to why we've got a really good outlook there. And so, we're intending to grow that population, especially
in our Middle Market and Business Banking businesses, where we've got opportunities in Texas and California.
And we will certainly add talent from other banks. We do that all the time. But I think that you put those two things
together, it's a very compelling story as to why you would look at Comerica compared to others. And so, Jim, I
might flip to you on the $100 billion number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Specific to the $100 billion efforts, I always remind people that we're one of two existing banks that have
been in that regime in the past. So, we've been there. We know how to do it. We kept some of the practices that
we had in place at that point in time. Of course, the bar has gone up since then, but we feel like we have really
strong capital planning and stress testing practices, liquidity stress testing practices.
When I look at what it takes to get ready for $100 billion, beyond just having that general good risk framework,
which we're making great progress on, the task that probably takes the most effort is just the data and all the
reporting that's required, and that has probably the longest tail on it. And we've been working on that really for the
last year, year-and-a-half. We're making great progress. We plan on being done well ahead of hitting $100 billion.
And so, our goal overall is to do this in layer, so that any one year there's not a huge step up in expenses. We will
ultimately have a higher run rate, a modestly higher run rate because of $100 billion in Category IV readiness. But
we're also working to offset those costs. And my goal is to put it in context of you'll never actually notice a big step

up specifically due to a Category IV readiness effort because we are layering them in as time goes on and feel
like we're on a really good track to be ready well ahead of hitting $100 billion.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. And then, maybe the natural follow-up question as it relates to next year and I'm not trying to pin you
down here, but I think we're hearing other banks at least plan for positive operating leverage next year. I heard
your comments on kind of NII trajectory, balance that with maybe some expense growth related to what you just
talked about. But is it at least the initial plan or expectation that you can generate positive operating leverage next
year? Thanks.

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
It's always our goal to have positive operating leverage. And, obviously, 2023 with the regional bank crisis and its
trailing effects on 2024 made that very challenging. But positive operating leverage is always our goal, and I
would say 2025 is no exception to that. That's our own expectation and that's what we are shooting for. And that
will be through a combination of both revenue efforts, as well as making sure that we calibrate expenses
appropriately.

Operator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Anthony Elian with JPMorgan
Chase. Please proceed with your question.

Hi. Good morning. Appreciate the comments you provided on loan growth and customer sentiment towards
quarter end. Just asking the question around loan growth expectations a different way. Once borrowers get past
hurdles of the election and we see more rate cuts, do you see a loan growth at the company at a level
comparable to the rest of the industry, or do you think you can grow faster than the industry just given your
footprint and other segments you mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Anthony, it's Peter. I'd answer that a couple of ways. We had a lot of years where we were growing at the
rate of the industry, if not, even slightly below for a while. But if you kind of went back 2019, 2022, so call it the
non-COVID, the non-2023 years, we were growing at a rate equal to or above the industry. So, I think on a go-
forward basis, particularly when we get to the other side of, as I talked earlier, about CRE kind of downward slope
from here, I think we should be able to grow at the industry growth rate or better when we get into 2025 and 2026.
That would be the expectation.

And I certainly think when you look at our portfolio, all of our specialty businesses being highly exposed in Texas
and in California, we would expect of ourselves to be growing better than the overall industry, and we've proven
that we could do that the last couple of years, absent sort of these major events. So, the only part of that I would
just caution again is the CRE headwind that we have, but the rest of the book, on a go-forward basis, we would
expect to be able to grow better than the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, I might just add, too, that when you look at – this is Curt – that the markets we operate in, really all of our
geographies have grown this year and expected to grow next year above GDP. So, we feel really good about sort
of the markets we operate in, the national specialty businesses that Peter referenced earlier. Part of our capital
management strategy is to reserve capital for loan growth. So, we are anticipating loan growth on a forward basis
where we feel really good about our funding position, and credit continues to be very well-behaved. So, we're
ready, willing and able, and we've got a great team on the field.
And back to the question earlier about relationship managers, we've got plenty of capacity right now for growth.
But again, we are building in additions of capacity through our training programs and selectively in some of our
businesses, external hires.

Thank you. And then, my follow-up, you saw good growth in Equity Fund Services deposits during the quarter.
Can you talk about what specifically you saw in that segment that drove the growth and the expectations for year-
end? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Anthony. So, I mean, Equity Fund Services has been a really good business for us. In 2023, it was one that
we did optimize quite a bit, I think, through last year. We are seeing good success in that business. It's a little bit
of a different environment there. There's not maybe as much fund formation as there was for a while. There's not
as much activity in the private equity space, as you know. But on a loan outlook standpoint, I feel like it's sort of up
from here. We did sort of expect to see a little more growth in Q3. It worked a little bit against us in August, but I
think that's starting to flatten out.
And on the deposit side, I mean, I just think we're continuing to add sort of more, what I would call, bilateral
relationships, where we're the only bank, which leads to more deposits, which leads to more treasury and fee
income. We're trying to do less participations per se in that business and more bilateral deals. And so, I think
we're just capturing relationship. And I think as events occur in the book that our customers have, we've proven
as a really good bank for them to place their deposits with. And as we talked about earlier, that's at appropriate
rates across our portfolio.
