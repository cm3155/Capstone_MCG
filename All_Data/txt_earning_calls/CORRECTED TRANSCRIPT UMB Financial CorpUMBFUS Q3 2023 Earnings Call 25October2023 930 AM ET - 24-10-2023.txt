Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Thank you, Kay. Good morning. I'm happy to be here with you today to share the details of our strong third
quarter performance. Our results reflect a strong, disciplined loan growth, stable deposits, continued momentum
in many of our fee-generating businesses, expense control, stable margin, and solid asset quality.
I continue to be extremely proud of the long track record of prudent underwriting that has produced these asset
quality metrics. Our loan portfolio remains healthy with 8 basis point net charge-offs for the third quarter and just 6
basis points year-to-date.
Non-performing loans improved 7 basis points from 9 basis points the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses
was $5 million for the quarter compared to $13 million in the second quarter, driven largely by changes in
macroeconomic variables and general improvement in the Watch and Classified categories.
The average charge-off ratio for the five-quarter period shown in our deck is the lowest in our history, impressive
considering the 18% increase in average loan balances during that same time period. We saw improvement in the
levels of both past watch loans and classified loans, which declined 13% and 6% respectively from the second
quarter. Our watch list levels fluctuate from time to time, as we manage the book. And historically, we've seen
very little migration to loss.
Our current historical credit performance has been achieved through our focus on risk management, a consistent
approach that comes from having the same team working together for multiple cycles and decades. We continue
to closely monitor macroeconomic trends and have regular conversations with our clients across our footprint,
something we do in all economic environments. Despite uncertainty from the brewing geopolitical crisis as well as
the volatility in interest rates, our commercial clients remain cautiously optimistic.
Now, I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Ram will follow up a few details and drivers. GAAP net
income for the third quarter was $96.6 million or $1.98 per share. Operating net income was $98.4 million or
$2.02 per share. Net interest income decreased 1.5% from the second quarter, as loan growth improved and
asset mix and yields were offset by an increase in deposit costs.
While net interest income for the industry continued to be impacted by higher funding costs, our net interest
margin in the third quarter was essentially flat on a linked quarter basis. The flexibility on the asset side of our
balance sheet helped mitigate the continued impact of liability pricing. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio lower than
our peers and industry medians and largely variable asset base and strategically planned cash flows.
In fee income, we saw solid results in several lines of businesses. Trust and securities processing income
increased 8.2%, driven by growth in all business contributing to this line; fund services, corporate trust and private
wealth. In fund services, assets under administration reached $400 billion in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, our team has added nearly 50 new clients, which helped drive a 9.2% increase in revenue as we
saw on a linked-quarter basis. Our non-interest expense level fell by 3.8% and included variances in deferred
compensation expense related to the reduced COLI income.
Additionally, severance expense declined along with salary and wage expense, reflecting the ongoing efforts to
control operating expenses. Ram will provide more additional color on these various drivers shortly.
Turning to the balance sheet, the drivers behind our 10.1% annualized growth in average loan balances this
quarter are shown on Slide 24. For comparison, the banks that reported results through October 20 at a median
linked-quarter annualized increase of 5.3%. The Federal Reserve H.8 data had predicted an increase in industry-

wide average loan balances of just 0.4% or 1.6% annualized. Despite some caution surrounding the current
environment, our relationship banking model continues to build a pipeline of quality clients, and given what we're
seeing today, we expect some continued outperformance relative to the industry and loan growth metrics.
Total topline loan production, as seen on Slide 25, was $649 million, with payoffs and paydowns declining slightly,
representing 3.2% of loans for the quarter. Credit quality is strong across our book, and the CRE portfolio remains
well-diversified by property, classification, tenant type and geography, as shown on the slide on Page 36 and 37.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see opportunity across our various lending verticals and geographic
regions. We have continued to evaluate the best use of our capital and we remain disciplined on pricing, further
emphasizing lending opportunities accompanied by meaningful deposit relationships.
On the other side of the balance sheet, average total deposits were essentially flat versus the second quarter.
Declines in brokered CD balances and typical seasonal reductions in public funds were offset by growth in
commercial deposit balance. We expect public fund balances will begin to rebuild again in the fourth quarter.
As we've noted previously, deposit balances will naturally ebb and flow as our largely commercial customer base
uses funds for typical business purposes, including payroll, dividends and other activities.
Finally, we've strengthened our liquidity and capital positions even further during the quarter, as depicted on Slide
32. Our quarter-end CET1 and total capital ratios were at 10.77% and 12.68%, improved by 12 basis points and 9
basis points respectively from June 30. Our CET1 ratio compares favorably to the peer median.
And in our press release, we announced that the board had approved a 2.6% increase in our dividend, bringing it
to $0.39 per share, payable in January. As we've shown on Slide 15 of our presentation, our quarterly dividend
has increased 283% over the past 20 years. There were 23 individual dividend increases during that period.
To wrap it up, we're pleased with our results this quarter. The pundits have varying opinions, but it seems clear
that inflation levels, however you want to measure it, haven't reached the Federal Reserve's expectations.
All indications are that the data-dependent Fed will pause on further interest rate hikes. The variables now are
when rate cuts may begin and how quickly they may happen. But we fully expect a higher for longer scenario at
least through 2024. Such a scenario would be favorable for our balance sheet, as the pressure on deposit costs
largely abate while asset repricing continues through that period.
Additionally, earning asset yields will improve, as we use cash flows from our securities portfolio on higher
yielding loans. With the uncertainty in the macro and geopolitical environment, we feel that our business model is
prepared for a wide range of outcomes. It has proven itself over time, as we've adapted to the changing
environment and set of circumstances.
Now I'll turn it over to Ram for a more detailed look at our results. Ram?

Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mariner. I'll share a few additional drivers of our third quarter results, then I'll discuss some key balance
sheet items. Net interest margin for the third quarter was 2.43%, a decrease of just 1 basis point from the linked
quarter. The largest drivers included positive impact of approximately 16 basis points from loan repricing and mix
and 11 basis points from the benefit of free funds. These positives were mostly offset by a reduction of 25 basis

points from changes in the interest-bearing deposit pricing. Frankly to date, our earning asset beta has been 51%,
keeping pace with the total cost-of-funds beta of 51%.
Our deposit remix showed some signs of slowing this quarter, and we ended the quarter with 32% of total
average deposits in DDAs. This level is in line with the low point during the 2015-2017 tightening cycle, and
although it's difficult to know for certain, we expect we're approaching the bottom. The decline in DDA balances
largely reflects corporate trust activity, which can be episodic. Commercial DDA balances increased
approximately 1% over the linked quarter.
With the current consensus that the Fed will hold rates for the time being, we continue to expect the terminal beta
of approximately 50% of total deposits and 60% for loans through the end of this cycle.
Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect NII to trend flat to slightly up while we'll see some additional
modest margin compression driven by mix shift at rate-bearing public funds come on the balance sheet. Our
reported non-interest income of $133.3 million contains a market-related variances to second quarter levels,
including a $3.5 million decrease in company-owned life insurance income and $896,000 decrease in customer-
related derivative income, as well as the impact of the $4 million gain on the sale of assets we discussed last
quarter.
These decreases were offset by a $5.1 million increase in trust and securities processing income, driven largely
by the new client acquisition in our fund services and CORPORATE TRUST businesses. The detailed drivers of
our $231.4 million in non-interest expense are shown in our slides and press release.
A few items of note. We recorded $133.4 million in salary and benefits expense, a decrease of $9.9 million
compared to the second quarter. Included were just $425,000 in deferred compensation expense, a reduction of
$2.8 million from the prior quarter. This is the offset to decreased COLI income. $2.4 million in severance
expense, a reduction of $2.5 million, a $1.6 million decrease in salary and wages, and $1.3 million reduction in
various other employee benefit costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in
operational losses.
Considering the impact of $2.4 million of severance along with the deferred compensation expense and typical
timing variances, we would put our quarterly starting point for expenses close to $228 million. Looking ahead, we
expect we'll make a typical fourth quarter charitable contribution of approximately $2 million.
Our effective tax rate was 18.1% year-to-date compared to 18.8% in the same period in 2022. The decreased rate
was driven primarily by a larger portion of income from tax-exempt securities and variations in the level of COLI
income. For the full-year 2023, we continue to expect a tax rate between 17% and 19%.
Now turning to more detail on the balance sheet. I'll start with our investment portfolio shown on slides 28 and 29.
Our average investment security balances declined 2.7% from the second quarter to $12.3 billion. The held-to-
maturity book included $1.2 billion of industrial revenue bonds.
During the quarter, $240 million of securities with an average yield at 1.90% rolled up. The yield on our total AFS
portfolio increased to 2.74% and has a duration of just over four years. The held-to-maturity portfolio, exclusive of
the IRB bonds I mentioned, had an average yield of 2.31% for the third quarter.
Additionally, the portfolio is expected to generate more than $1.6 billion of cash flows in the next 12 months,
providing further funding flexibility. The roll-off of these securities, which have a blended rate of 2.18%, will also

improve our AOCI position over that period. As of September 30, the unrealized pre-tax loss of AFS portfolio was
$918 million or 12.7% of the amortized cost. For the HTM portfolio, this loss was $876 million, including the IRB
bonds.
Slide 32 highlights our liquidity position, along with contingent sources of funding. As of September 30, we had
$18.1 billion in available liquidity sources. Liquidity coverage of adjusted uninsured deposits increased to 127% at
quarter-end. Our tangible common equity ratio was 6.13% at September 30. When excluding the impact of AOCI,
that ratio improved to 8.06%.
Tangible book value was $52.06 per share, an increase of 8% compared to the same period a year ago. Since
September 30, 2018, we have experienced a 5.3% annualized growth rate in tangible book value per share.
As we noted last quarter, we maintain our focus as a growth company while positioning our balance sheet to
support that growth and provide the flexibility to address uncertainty in the industry.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of
the call.

Nathan J. Race Q

Ram, in terms of kind of the expectations for NII to be kind of flat to slightly down in the quarter, curious kind of
what that contemplates in terms of the size of the earning asset base into the fourth quarter. It looks like you guys
were able to reduce some wholesale sources in the quarter and you also have about $1.9 billion maturing in the
fourth quarter. So just trying to think how we should think about the trajectory of the earning asset base
[indiscernible] (16:31).

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Yeah. Sure, Nate. No material change in our investment portfolio other than cash flows that will continue to rotate
out into the loan portfolio. So you'll see that in one of our slide decks. We have what the expected cash flows from
the portfolio is going to be. We still haven't purchased any new securities, as you see in that disclosure as well.
And then, everything else on the earning asset side is going to be largely loan growth. So, no material changes in
the Fed account balances. Yes, we did bring down our liquidity balances from the second quarter to the third
quarter but don't expect it to change materially from where it was.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would just add that as we've done in the past, we expect loan growth in the fourth quarter to be light and
strengths to the – to the quarter we just ended that was strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. Changing gears, thinking about fee income going forward, obviously you had nice growth in
fund services revenue, corporate and institutional asset management. Just curious how that pipeline looks in
terms of new client win opportunities and as kind of the rate of growth that we saw in 3Q versus 2Q is kind of
sustainable going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. That – the strength remains very good. Fund services, in particular, we mentioned in our deck, is – had 50
new clients year-to-date and – which is – represents – I think it gives us over 10% growth in the segment. The
pipeline remains very strong for that business. There's been a lot of dislocation, continues to be a lot of dislocation
in the space, as the private equity firms have gotten into the business and acquired our competitors has been
very good for our business, and we expect that to continue to be the case.
Corporate trust, you know, the money has been unlocked, projects are getting done, the public and private
projects are getting done, and that's unlocking value for us there. Everyone has seen what's happened with the
airline activity being up and strong and moving again. So there, we continue to and expect in the coming quarters
for that revenue to unlock in our – at our aviation vertical that's in corporate trust.
Our health care business continues to be strong as we continue to focus more on direct sales with our customer
base. Our forward spend, we expect it to continue to be strong going forward, whether it's healthcare spend or it's
commercial. So, kind of all cylinders really, we feel like there's nice profile of growth across all of our non-interest
income verticals and continue to feel good about that.
As you know, you know, in the second quarter, we had that hard sales of about $4 million. So if you take that out,
the trajectory from quarter to quarter and looking forward, it's pretty strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just lastly, turning to credit quality, it's great to see improvement across the board in 3Q. I
think one thing that we've seen from some of your peers thus far in earnings season is some greater scrutiny on
shared national credits. So just curious if you could remind us how large that portfolio is and to what degree you
guys age in any club deals or shared national credits within the portfolio?

Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Tom – pardon me – Tom Terry, Chief Credit Officer. The shared national credits that we have, about
$2.5 billion, maybe closer to $3 billion, almost all of those related to other businesses. So, for example, our fund
services business, we have large health insurance companies as clients, and we will participate in their shared
national credit to support the fee income that we get on the fund services side. So we're not interested in shared
national credits for the sake of being in them. The lion's share are ones that support other business, and they're
high quality. As far as [indiscernible] (20:48), we're – we age very – pardon me – very few of those. So – does that
answer your question?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody. Mariner, maybe a question for you. You've talked and done a really good job
historically on operating leverage. Expenses were really well-controlled this quarter. How should we be thinking
about operating leverage in this increasingly tough environment for revenue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I think you kind of hit with a nail on the head there to see in the environment with really pretty much what's
happened with interest cost. Right? It's a storyline there. It's more challenging in this environment to accomplish
really, I would guess, what any of us want to accomplish. We are still laser-focused on it.
And it's – obviously, we don't give guidance, but it'd be hard for us to point you in any one direction kind of early in
the year to think about the budget for next year, just to really be able to talk intelligently about where that might
head. But we are – operating leverage and – as opposed to efficiency ratio is definitely where we put our
emphasis. And we'll continue to be focused on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, I think – I want to make sure I heard you on the fourth quarter loan growth. Was the – was the
expectation moderation from this quarter or [ph] how many (23:49) is that?

Christopher McGratty Q

Okay. Got it. And then finally, in terms of the balance sheet, some of your peers are thinking about retooling some
of the investment portfolio, given the moving rates. I mean, any appetite to move things around in the bond
portfolio? Obviously, you're not reinvesting, but any kind of restructuring that might be contemplated?

desire or need really to do any of that.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe a – hi. Just following up on that last line of questioning, was the seasonal inflow expected on the public
funds? I guess, what's the expectation for the bond book and size next quarter? Are you going to be reinvesting
some of those proceeds that are rolling off or is the bond book going to remain a source of funds for the loan
growth you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It will remain a source of funds through the end of the year and maybe early into next year. And then we'll have to
evaluate based on loan production and deposit goals and whatnot. But at this point, we're still going to let it fund
our balance sheet growth – or loan growth, I should say.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, looking at the loan growth, the CRE construction growth remains pretty impressive. I'm just
wondering how much of that is contractual as some of these loans start to fund up on schedule and what that
pipeline looks like over the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It's a mix. A lot of the funding we've seen certainly are deals that we approved over the last six months and 12
months that are now hitting the construction phase. There's still activity. We're still seeing on demand for multi-
family and for industrial, albeit it's probably slowed a little bit, but there is still demand, still seeing activity. So it's a
– to answer your question specifically in terms of funding, though, it's a mix of what we've approved over the last
six months to 12 months.

just economic uncertainty? I guess, any kind of color you can provide on some of the early-stage building
conversations you're having?

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think, you know, I'll echo the comment – this is Mariner – that Tom said, which is that there's plenty of
opportunity. The mix is changing. Right? So, multi-family and industrial remain very strong while obviously office
and other categories are winning significantly.
So, with a higher interest rate environment and a low supply, housing supply in the marketplace, there's still very
strong interest and demand for multifamily. There are pockets in the country where that isn't the case. There are
places where there's over investment. There are places where people are building Class A when the need is
Class B, etcetera. So we pay attention to those kind of issues to stay away from problems. But there is strong
demand that we understand for multifamily.
And industrial continues to be strong because there's a real need for last-mile distribution and tilt up buildings to
support the Amazonification of America and delivery – and then all of the businesses that either support Amazon
or compete with Amazon. So there's – there's a pretty significant buildout underway that we believe and
understand still to support the way consumers receive delivery of goods in America. So we think those two things
continue to present strong, high-quality opportunities for us.

The real shift in our book going forward in the environment we're in with excess liquidity gone from the system is
we're more focused on making sure we reserve our capital for customers and people who do business with us
and are willing to put their deposits and broaden their relationship with us. So that – that would be the – the only
difference as you think about the landscape of opportunity. We still see quite a bit of opportunity and really, really
about us honing in and making sure that we're reserving that for people who really want to deepen their
relationships with us.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that. And then just last for me, on the expense side, appreciate the guide for fourth quarter.
Maybe as we look into 2024 and again parlaying on Chris's question, how much of – how much leverage is there
on the expense base in order to drive positive operating leverage? Should we expect expenses to grind higher
through 2024 or is there confidence that those can be fairly well-maintained and be a positive source of operating
leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We certainly think we can continue to maintain – at a minimum, maintain what we've been able to accomplish. I –
it's too early to tell what else and we don't give any guidance. But there's always room to improve and to be
better. I would think, any – at any company and we continue look for those – those opportunities to do business –
I would say, to do business smarter. And we're always looking for those opportunities, and I think we'll forever
uncover them.

Operator: We have a follow-up question from Nathan Race at Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just kind of curious thinking about how you guys are thinking about the
margin trajectory next year in the higher-for-longer rate environment? Obviously, you're seeing less pressure on
the index deposits under that scenario and you have some kind of lag in repricing in terms of the duration of the
portfolio in and of itself on the loan side of things. So, any kind of preliminary thoughts on how you guys are
thinking about the margin and NII trajectory next year under those frameworks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Appreciate the opportunity to make our case for our investment thesis. Yeah. We do believe that and under a
higher-for-longer scenario, if the Fed stops, which that would – you know, that would be the scenario where we
would anticipate. And under that scenario, the deposits – the pressure on the deposits will alleviate, and new and

repricing credit would continue to add value along with the roll-up of the investment portfolio into higher yielding
assets. So that is – that is the expectation if the Fed does stop.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And I know it's difficult to predict future provisioning impacts under CECL. But just kind of any
thoughts on kind of how you guys are thinking about providing for growth and assuming you're not really seeing
any material credit issues on the horizon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a million-dollar question, Nate. So, as you've seen in the last few quarters, given our credit quality,
most of our provision really come – came from both macroeconomic variables changing in this past quarter
because Moody's moved towards more of a soft landing. Our provision was low compared – and then our charge-
offs were low as well. So it really depends on what level of loan growth that we have and what happens to the
macroeconomic variables.
As Mariner said, we had 15% decline in quarter-over-quarter on our past watch loans and 6% in our classified.
So, from a portfolio of health perspective, that's not a lot of pressure. But as we've said, the magic math that we
have to work sometimes is trying to get our coverage ratio at or close to 1%. Right? That's kind of what we would
like entering any kind of cycle, whether it's good or bad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. So it sounds like absent material macro deterioration, the expectations for you guys to build a reserve close
to 1% over the next few quarters just in support of loan growth and assuming charge-offs -?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're at 97 bps. Yeah. We're within splitting this and we're at 97 basis points coverage, I'd say, plus or
minus a few basis points here and there on what our coverage ratio ends up being.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, just one last one. I know you guys don't pay a ton of attention to end-of-period balances. But I
was more surprised to see the noninterest-bearing attrition accelerate versus last quarter. Any thoughts on kind of
when that could bottom based on what you see in terms of client spending and so forth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
So if you look at what happened, as I said in the script, our commercial DDA balances, so it's what you're alluding
to about cash usage, that actually was up 1% on an average basis. And the decline in the third quarter DDA
14

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
balances were more episodic because of some of our corporate trust deals. There's always a seasonal buildup
and tax payments go out.
So we know and it's very predictable from that standpoint. So I would say, on the commercial side, things are
fairly stabilized. Again, it's really – as we said, we think we're approaching the bottom in terms of our 32% DDA to
total deposits, which was the cycle low from last time. But that's the – to your earlier question, that's the biggest X
factor on what can change our margin or our net interest income curve from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I would just – none of us know. Right? But I would just suggest that as the Fed has done and the
way our income statement has worked and our customer base works, we said this all summer long. We would go
through this first because our customers were largely commercial. We've seen that. We think that's largely done.
And we – we predicted that because of the last cycle being at 32. That's done. We're 32 today. So, from here,
your guess is as good as ours. Using the history and the behavioral patterns, it seems as though we're near the
bottom on that – on that shift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then, just in terms of overall deposits expectations, average deposits were flat in the quarter.
Just curious, based on what you guys see in terms of your pipeline, how you're thinking about overall deposit
growth expectations over the next several quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We – we continue to have a strong pipeline. This all comes down to cost, at the end of the day. We have a very,
very strong ability, I think, in a way that most banks our size don't to tap deposits. It's really about paying market
rate for them and then really it's about assets and liabilities, about our disciplined approach to pricing assets, not
just the deposits. And so we don't concern ourselves too much with the ability to grow our deposits. We just have
to make sure that we're disciplined on the way we manage assets and liabilities and making sure – which we've
been able to do to-date to bring on loans. We feel very comfortable about our ability to price them appropriately,
to maintain at a respectable margin spread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. I appreciate you guys taking the follow-ups. Thanks again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks. Yeah. I might just remind everybody, we're done. Just because it's been a – and you start in April with
the way the world look and you look and then you get to where we are now. We really feel pretty good about our –
where we sit. And just want to remind you a couple of things I said a moment ago. UMB said early on in the
summer and spring that we would get to – likely get to 32% on noninterest-bearing total, and that's about where
we sit here now.
We said we would go through the margin trouble early, and then while others were seeing the declines, we've
flattened out. On a linked-quarter basis, you've seen us flatten out margin on a linked-quarter basis. We continue

to tell you we're going to have outsized loan growth. We continue to have outsized loan growth. We continue to
tell the Street about our ability over time to manage asset quality.
And while everybody's asset quality looks good right now, ours looks good in the last cycle. So we continue to
have excellent asset volume. We've had the best five quarters linked together we've had in our history from an
asset quality standpoint. And we have the same management team, managing credit that we've seen through the
last few cycles. We're still on top of credit this cycle. And we expect that we'll continue to manage our company
the way we always have.
And lastly, we're one of the few banks this quarter on a linked-quarter basis to show reduction in expenses of
3.4% in our case. And so really, across the board, everything that we can control, we've controlled and have
performed. And any business, every once in a while, for geopolitical reasons or otherwise, their input costs go up.
And so this is a job to manage how you pass on those costs or you become more efficient. And we're doing our
job and we're pleased with our results, and we hope you are as well.
