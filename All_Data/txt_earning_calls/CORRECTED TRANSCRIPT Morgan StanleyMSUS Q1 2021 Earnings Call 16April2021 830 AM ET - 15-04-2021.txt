James Patrick Gorman
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the
firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs; numerous performance
records; the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year; and one very
complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund Archegos.
In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal
the operating leverage in our business, and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. Wealth Management
generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best-ever

quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represent an
annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pre-tax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only
improve in future years and we expect will exceed 30% as rates tick up.
Daily trades reached a new record with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE and particularly
the strength of the self-directed channel has exceeded our expectations. In addition, assets continue to migrate
towards advice. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record
pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace
business is adding corporate plans. And as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1
million.
Institutional Securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income
had their strongest first quarter of the last decade and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment
banking revenues reached a record driven by record equity underwriting, and our equities division also had its
best quarter in over a decade.
Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together two
high-performing asset managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead
of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between
announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the
transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion and pro forma net flows
were approximately $100 billion.
In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%.
Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination and increasingly
recognize the highly differentiated value [indiscernible] (00:04:02) solutions that we offer across the global
platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion and is very well-positioned
in key secular growth segments.
Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large
single stock positions through a series of block sales culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a
net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay
us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely de-risk the remaining smaller long and short
positions which, while not especially problematic, might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as
rapidly as possible and, in so doing, incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as
necessary and money well-spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution
came together and responded to this very complex situation.
Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both
businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations and, as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding
without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing Wealth and Investment Management
businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which approximately $150 billion represented net-new client
assets to the firm this quarter. We are more than convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan
Stanley for growth in the years ahead.
I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail. And together, we'll take your questions.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Jonathan M. Pruzan
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Thank you and good morning. The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across
businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets
were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4%, and our
efficiency ratio was 66%.
First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we
made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and three years' restated
data on pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. The more significant items are as follows. For the firm, the provision
for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income
statement versus being in other revenues and expenses. In Institutional Securities, sales and trading net revenue
have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues
that are directly attributable to those businesses. And other revenues notably contain corporate loans and lending
commitments and related hedges as well as the impact of deferred compensation plans.
And in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified
reporting by breaking revenues into two lines. Asset management has been renamed asset management and
related fees, although the historical numbers remain the same. And we have combined the remaining revenue
categories under a new line named performance-based income and other, notably carried interest. We have also
updated our AUM disclosures. Alternatives and other has been updated to alternatives and solutions to reflect the
addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio services for institutional investors that
have been included in a new line called liquidity and overlay services.
Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back half of 2020
continued as clients remained highly engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-
based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a
66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients
across the complex. Regionally, Asia remained a standout. Building on the four best quarters of the last decade in
2020, the first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking
and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade.
Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year driven by record
underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes
versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion
reflect its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong with blocks, follow-ons and
convertibles also notable. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $631 million were the second highest only to the
second quarter of last year as companies continued to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment.
We saw strong activity across non-investment-grade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers.
Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active, equity markets
should support issuance, and conditions remain favorable for borrowers, and we are seeing a broadening across
sectors beyond technology and healthcare.
Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade as global equity market volumes remained
elevated. Derivative results were the best in a decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive
trading market environment. Both cash and prime brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year.
Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher prime brokerage balances respectively were offset by the
losses James discussed.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad-
based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of US
fiscal stimulus, and the movement in passive rates supported client activity. Micro performance continues to be
strong. The meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro
results were robust though reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid/ask spreads were more
stable this period, and commodities also had solid results.
Other revenues of $123 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains
related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-mark
losses on corporate loans and related hedges.
Turning to ISG lending. Our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic
outlook and paydowns on corporate relationship loans, particularly non-investment-grade, resulted in a release of
$93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million, and our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and
lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion, while lending commitments
increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. Our vulnerable sector
portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans and lending commitments. We saw some
velocity in the book with new commitments for investment-grade clients that were largely offset by paydowns.
Approximately 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment-grade or secured. And lastly,
forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million.
Turning to Wealth Management. Given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make
comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were
$6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million
versus the prior quarter, revenue increased 11%. Integration-related expenses were $64 million. And excluding
these costs, pre-tax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.9%.
The underlying growth drivers in this business remain extremely strong. Net-new asset growth was $105 billion
driven by net-new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows
were a record $37 billion, and self-directed channel net-new households grew by a record 500,000 or 7%.
Financial advisors also recognize the value of our platform, demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting
and retention which also benefited NNA.
Elevated client activity across both advisor-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues.
Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high, putting more
cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust, reflecting record net buying
activity. Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of 1.6 million, almost 50% higher
than the fourth quarter record of 1.1 million. Importantly, revenue-related to the E*TRADE platform transactional
activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin.
Asset management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially benefiting from higher asset levels and record
fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater
than the cumulative growth of the prior six years, and revenues are up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan
growth remains extremely robust with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular
strength in securities-based lending led to quarterly balance sheet growth of $7 billion, north of the 10% full year
guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing
to the strong growth.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Net interest income was $1.4 billion including pre-payment amortization which turned positive and was
approximately $100 million. Excluding pre-pay, NII was up 6% and in line with our prior guidance. The increase
reflected the realization of funding synergies driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were
previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, growth in bank lending balances, and increased margin lending in
the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since
we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding
benefits in 2021. We would also expect to run-off additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the
remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and
continued growth in lending.
We're even more excited about E*TRADE today than when we announced the deal as momentum on the
E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The
business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's
NNA. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of a year rather
than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start.
We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress with our integration. The rest of 2021 will be focused
on analyzing the comprehensive datasets which cover advisor-led and self-directed clients to help better
understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisors to
service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their
entire wealth journey.
Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we
have made to-date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients
and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity plan wins
increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the
Morgan Stanley At Work platform. Our number of participants now stands at 5.1 million. We are also focused on
ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds.
Today, approximately 50% have one and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18
months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows.
On the expense side, we're on track to realize $100 million of cost synergies in 2021, and have made progress in
the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400
million expense synergies by the end of the year.
Moving to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million
shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including
$4 billion of intangibles, of which half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio is impacted by
approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include one month of the combined businesses' financials, so
comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward.
We are pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcement to close, and total AUM
now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon
close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. The underlying fundamentals of this
business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows
on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-
based across products and regions.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
We saw particular strength in MSIM global equity strategies which continued to attract robust flows following
strong investment performance. Parametric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the
alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and Parametric is the market
leader in this space. Eaton Vance's leading floating rate loan business recovered to strong positive flows, and
Calvert saw strong growth as ESG investing accelerates.
In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution for more durable
management fee revenue has meaningful increase, and asset management-related fees were $1.1 billion with
just one month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in
the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was
primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds which continued their recovery from 1Q 2020. Total expenses
were $944 million, of which integration-related expenses were negligible.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels and
the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter at $454 billion, and our
standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter to 16.8%. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we
continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%.
We are pleased with our results in the first quarter as our three world-class businesses of scale delivered
exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong,
and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive
our business model towards more durable, more recurring, and less capital-intensive businesses. While it's very
early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services with our enlarged
customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net-new client assets to the franchise. And our unique
business model is well-positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops.
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your
line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I'd like to ask maybe first on Wealth Management. The net-new asset growth rate implying double-digit organic is
really impressive, not something that the narrative around wirehouses failing to be able to grow really jives with.
So I'm curious. I know we've seen these trends accelerate from Morgan Stanley for over a year now, but how
much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to E*TRADE versus full-service Wealth Management at Morgan
Stanley? And how should we think about a sustainable organic net-new asset growth going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, Brennan, let me have a go at that. I mean, historically, the growth rate, as you probably know in the full-
service, as you call it wirehouses, has been, I don't know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years with loss of financial
advisors, some loss of assets into the RIA channel, and clearly loss to some of the direct distributors and
generally just not having in place significant growth plans. And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute
levels in a minute, but this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business.
Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel; we have that through E*TRADE. Number two, we
needed to have a compelling workplace platform; we have that through Solium and E*TRADE. Number three, we
needed to have net-positive FA growth in terms of recruiting not in just numbers of bodies but actual people who
are bringing assets, and we're doing that. And number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas which link to
our Institutional business and the quality research and product. You're just operating at a different level.
And so I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things. E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means
the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business which, again,
we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our
target I think was 4% to 6%. Now this at 10%, while Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter, Q2 usually has
some tax factors, tax flows going on.
But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualize 10% a year for the next several years, that would be
spectacular. But that's certainly not what we're planning on, and I got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of
our non-traditional competitors even per quarter, it's a wonderful greenshoot to have planted out there.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No doubt. Thanks for that color, James. And then thinking about NII within the Wealth Management business.
Jon, you made some comments on NII, but I wasn't sure if those were just purely on Wealth or implied. When we
think about it on the Wealth Management business, thanks for quantifying the pre-pay impact, is this – you've got
strong loan growth. We've got securities yields that have been recovering since yesterday's setback. So should
we be expecting continued constructive trends in core NII, ex-ing out any noise that might happen from pre-pay
quarter-to-quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I think the short answer is yes. We've really got some nice tailwinds from the loan growth that we've been
experiencing as well as the deposit funding synergies. I think as I said in the first quarter, we don't expect any
movement in policy rates. The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth we would expect from the
full realization of the onboarding of deposits which, as you know, was feathered in over the quarter. And so that
will have the full impact next quarter.
At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I
said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run-off
because of the onboarding. So we feel good about the guidance we gave you. The $1.2 billion in the fourth
quarter was a good run rate and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We
also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending which is not in the bank but is part of the Wealth Management
NII story. So again, just a nice quarter and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels.

with how the firm responded just given the complexity of the situation. What were some of the learnings from that

ensure that you can avert a similar situation in the future?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think, I mean, my comment about the way this team has worked together now for a decade, we all went
through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job a level below where we are now. So I'd say the accumulated
both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy; we cauterize bad stuff and deal with it as
soon as we possibly can. This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office, actually; no outside
money. It got to enormous size by the growth in their single stock position, a very concentrated single stock long
position that had explosive growth, and they're offset by the very shorts and the indices that they were short.
So it was – and I think what – the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. But it's not going to
change how we feel about the prime brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably
generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of
the equities business, so it doesn't change that at all. But I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type
relationships where they're very concentrated and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency
and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's
something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at and that's probably good for the whole industry. Better
information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be.
So obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it. But as I said, we're never happy taking
a loss. But our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did.
And we took the extra bit frankly just to clean it up by quarter end. We didn't want this thing to be lingering.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, that's helpful color, James, and certainly appreciate your candor on the topic. Just for my follow-up, another
one on NII. Jon, I just wanted to get a sense. Looking at the cost of deposit disclosure, nice to see that come in
from 24 bps to 18 basis points. And one of the things that we're thinking about just given some of the funding
benefits from E*TRADE as well as just some higher-cost wholesale deposits that start to roll off, where should we
expect that number to ultimately bottom? And is that what informs those benefits, at least your expectation that
we should be able to grow or build NII from here going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
So the weighted average cost of deposits is 18 basis points. It will clearly continue to tick down over the course of
the quarter assuming rates, short-term rates don't move. And again, we're not expecting policy rates to move as
the wholesale, higher cost wholesale deposits roll off. I think as you recall, when we originally announced the
transaction, I think we talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the
growth in deposits. We said that we would realize that and $200 billion of which will be realized this year, so we
have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022.
So all of the, sort of the movement, if you will, in the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our funding synergy
calculations. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move, so
there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates. And NII will grow because the quantum will
grow based on loan growth, and then we pick up the funding synergies.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks. James, I think you covered some of the stuff that I wanted to cover on Archegos, but a couple quick
follow-ups. I still want to get to what was so complex about this one. Is it really just the family office nature and the
less disclosure on the multiple primes and the leverage it employed? Because obviously, what's been great about
your PB business is – I mean, you didn't even lose money in 2008. You have the assets – historically, when you
have the assets and things break, you look for more collateral before you blow out the positions. What was
different about this one and what do you think – why wasn't it disclosed? Why didn't this meet the materiality test?
And then, what do you think regulators want to change going forward? Thanks. Sorry for the follow-ups.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, Glenn, I'll try and touch on a couple of them. And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter, and
so I don't want to spend too much talking about a specific client situation which is now done and history. But let
me touch on a couple of things, going sort of reverse order. Why we didn't disclose? We were having a record
quarter. The business ISG was having a record quarter. The equities business where this resided was having a
record quarter, so you've got to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter. And I'll leave that up to the
lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. Frankly, given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2
billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of, I don't know, 340 quarters that we've had since our
origination. So you've got to sort of focus on the big picture on that one.
What was different about this situation relative to 2008? And yeah, you're right. I don't think we've had – we went
back through the records, and I don't think we've ever had, and ever is a long time, but a loss in the PB business.
And the business is, back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk-managed and has
been for decades now, and we're the number one prime broker in the world. We were the number one prime
broker in this particular instance. There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They
were levered across multiple prime brokers. And as I said, their disclosure rules as I understand them, and I'm not
the expert on it, made it more difficult to understand exactly who was holding what where, and that's something
that we'll work through and that's part of the learning experience.
It was complicated I will say, last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related
to a security in which we have been an underwriter, and we thought the right thing to do was to close that
previous underwriting which happened on that Friday. So we had to hold off which caused us to be later than
some, if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on, we just felt we had
an underwriting obligation to deal with. So anyways, it's a long story. But again, in the context of equities
business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary.

I appreciate that. And then on workplace, it's such a good growth and good margin business on its own. How do
you execute? You mentioned the companion accounts over the next 12, 18 months. How do you execute on that?
And then how do you execute on morphing them to the all-important Wealth Management advisory relationship?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Good morning. Hope everyone can hear me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
We can now. Sorry about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Perfect. No worries. Okay. Just circling back to the Wealth Management business. The organic growth there,
look, was pretty spectacular at north of 10%. And I was wondering if you can give more detail on the legacy
financial advisor business? I hear you on E*TRADE and workplace, but the vast majority of the business is still
the FA business and it's really surprising to see this level of growth. So just curious. How much did recruiting, for
example, drive growth? Have you made any changes to the recruiting incentives that you're paying out to drive
more growth? Just trying to understand some of the core drivers of the strength here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure, Christian. It's Jon. I'll take that. I would say just first on net recruiting, I think you've heard us talk about this
for the last several quarters. We've been very active. We've become a destination of choice. So all the comments
that James made about the breadth of the platform, the intellectual capital, the technology investments that we've
made have made our platform and our company a place where FAs want to do business. So we've seen higher
levels of recruiting pipeline as we bring in FAs, and they are successful and they like the platform. They're
obviously talking to their previous colleagues, and therefore it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net
recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams, and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's
point number one.
In terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made. Net recruiting aided in
the NNA, the E*TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel bringing in existing
clients away, so just broad-based activity; very, very active. We talked about client engagement being quite
spectacular this quarter, and it really aided those numbers. But broad-based.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Okay. Thank you. And then on FICC, to your point, it's been a while since we've seen this level of revenues in that
business. And you called out securitized products as a real strength, which I think has always been a bigger
business for Morgan Stanley. Maybe any more details on that business and what's driving growth? Is it anything
to do with the state of the mortgage markets and the strength there? Just trying to get more color on sort of
maybe that business and what's driving the strong growth there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. And again, I think that as I said, the FICC business, it was really every business in all geographies
contributed to that quarter, $3 billion of revenue. The team is working extremely well together. We are gaining
share in that business. The depth of the franchise continues to improve as you can imagine in this environment
where the debate around rates and inflation and credit and yield. So generally speaking, the credit products have
been quite active and volumes have been quite elevated. Also, it's being aided by the primary calendar agency
issuance. So just a lot of good activity going on in credit. And I think as you saw this quarter, a lot of debate
around rates, inflation, reflation which really added to those results.

Christian Bolu Q

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, great timing with your E*TRADE acquisition, and I guess retail volumes are some two to three times
higher than historical from what I can tell. Are you seeing those trends continue through the end of March? And
do you expect that to reverse as we get out of the pandemic and people get out of the house and stop trading as
much? Or maybe this is secular?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure, Mike. Yeah, no, we're really pleased with the timing of the transaction. As you highlight, just if you look at
number of clients, volumes, trades, all of the metrics that we historically look at in that business, they're
dramatically higher today than they were when we announced the transaction back in February of last year. So
we're also seeing that same engagement across the FA-led channel, so it's not just related to E*TRADE. So I
think client engagement is very, very strong. At 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average
trade in the fourth quarter which was a record. It was less than 1 million over the course of last year, so we're
clearly at elevated levels. Do I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in 2019? No.
But can we sustain this level? No one's got a crystal ball. But right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged and
we'll have to see how this plays out over time.

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Mike, I'll just add the two kickers. There will be some. Obviously, these markets won't stay at this kind of retail
activity forever. But the two strategic kickers behind this business which are yet to really have the impact that they
will have are obviously the deposits, and as rates rise that will be a phenomenal additive. And secondly, the whole
workplace as we're integrating with Solium, and that's proving. We had some stats in there; I think about 5 million-
plus clients in there. But that's a huge growth business for us and I think that'll be sort of the story of the next five
years as much as the very elevated activity will be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then my separate question goes back to Archegos. So if I heard you correctly, you had $900 million of
losses, and that compares to record equities anyway, $40 billion of revenues over the past decade in prime
brokerage. But within all the news around this, I guess it was just press reports saying that you didn't have losses,
so I think it's a little bit of a surprise and does speak to risk management. And so I guess my question is are you –
how much of your Prime Brokerage business relates to family offices since you're saying you're taking another
look at that? And why do you think it was that you were the only large bank to call out losses of this magnitude
when others didn't? I mean, did you – I don't know what you guys did differently versus Citibank, Comerica,
Chase, Morgan, and Goldman Sachs or maybe they didn't disclose it. I just don't know. If you can share some
color on that, that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, I'll give you a couple of things just on the – we're in a quiet period, so there are certain times when you can't
comment about the business unless you sort of pre-announce earnings, which we weren't going to do given that it
was a record. So secondly, I'm not going to comment on other firms. Some of them weren't even prime brokers to
this institution I don't think, so each of them have their own bid and they make it. And thirdly, the context is the
business is a phenomenal business. It's being risk-managed very well. This was a very unusual incident. I think
the family office – I don't have those numbers; Jon might. But I suspect it's less than 10% of the Prime Brokerage
business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Very small.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Very small. So yeah, Mike. I mean, listen, we're quite transparent about this. We don't like to take losses ever.
Unfortunately, when you intermediate flows of capital, you sometimes says that's what our whole margin book is.
And the question is once you're faced with the reality, how does the team come together to deal with it, and I think
they did. As I said, I think they did a really good job.

All right. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, just on the trading front. Obviously, robust quarter even
with some of those losses. I realize it's difficult to gauge the outlook, but just what drivers are you seeing that
could continue to drive activity versus normalize it? And how has your market share been trending during this
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
It's a great question. And again, without the crystal ball, I'll just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw
in the first quarter and then we collectively can decide whether we think that'll persist for what period of time. We
clearly still have strong asset values. I mentioned we have healthy pipelines and clients are significantly engaged,
both retail and institutional. Markets are open. There's lots of liquidity, and we are seeing a continuation of the
accelerating economic data around the globe, obviously news coming out of China this morning or last night in
terms of the growth recovery. So really good backdrop or macro backdrop.
As James mentioned, seasonality, the first quarter is usually the strongest. Typically, it wasn't last year. But
typically, it is the strongest in these businesses. We are confident that we have the ability to deliver on the
objectives that we set out earlier this year in terms of our strategic goals. We do believe, and I think the data
supports that we're gaining market share across all of our businesses, so that's something that we would expect
to persist. And I think this year is really going to be focused on that, just growing our market shares and
integrating these two very important acquisitions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. Just on the Wealth and Investment Management, organic growth
obviously very strong. James, you mentioned some of the retail activity could moderate. I guess maybe on the flip
side, both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, they're very early. It's early innings in terms of integrating it and getting to
like the maximum potential. So what are some of those initiatives over the next one to two years that you feel like
could maybe partially offset any normalization that we eventually get?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Well, I think James mentioned a couple of those already. I mean, I think what we've said all along, we're going to
be very deliberate with the integrations. These deals were not about costs; they were about growth. And we do
not want to, we don't want to disrupt the client experience. We obviously want to enhance it over time, so we are
being very deliberate. We're investing in the platforms, we're investing in the service model. And we are in the
process, as we've mentioned before, of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand
what we need so we can service our clients better. So for example, we're defining running pilots around lead
generation. We're defining the FAs that will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring
models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FA to the client based on specific

needs. And the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes, the people, and the process to be
able to support our clients in the coming years.
So we think there's huge potential. James mentioned the 5 million workplace participants. We're only clients
outside of that channel with about half of those. That business continues to grow. The great thing about that
business is that it's scalable. Think of it as a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships.
That experience is digital, so it is very, very scalable. And we would expect real growth not only in that channel
but to drive growth across the platform really out of the workplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
And just to add to it. I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these four businesses, the Eaton
Vance, our own Investment Management business, our traditional core Wealth Management business, and
E*TRADE, and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. I mean, look at the
Parametric product in Eaton Vance; it's extraordinary. They've done an unbelievable job. Calvert funds with
everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with
Solium there, and now we'll be one of the top two workplace providers in the world.
Things that we can do to expand internationally, taking Eaton Vance's product, using our international distribution,
putting some of our core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution; they have a great capability
there. So it's just – there are so many verticals now which are driving growth. And once upon a time when we had
the core business at sort of number of financial advisors and productivity per financial advisor, that's basically the
only two metrics you needed to follow, and now we've got like 30 different things that are bobbing along.
So sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management I've told the team internally;
they hate that. But you know what? I told Danny Simkowitz a couple of years ago that my target I said on a public
platform was $1 trillion assets under management in the Wealth Asset Management business. And he correctly
pointed out it's revenues per asset; it's not assets. And I said yeah, I know, but I'd like $1 trillion with high
revenues per asset. And guess what, we've got $1.4 trillion. When we started the Wealth Management journey 12
years ago, we had $500 billion under management; now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to $10 trillion.
We've got all these growth verticals and I just couldn't be more excited about it.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe just a little more color on the workplace. I feel like it's a good growth and good
margin business on its own. But nirvana is the ability to transition them over to a total wealth management advisor
relationship over time. So the question is how do you execute on that? You mentioned companion accounts. But
do you make research available? What products do you push across? How do you pre-market to them to convert
them because it takes time? Thanks.

Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
So I think you sort of highlighted some of the things that are going to drive the growth going forward. I mean,
again, we want more corporate accounts. We're seeing the pipeline very strong. The hit rate is higher and the
product is really resonating. We then want to grow the participants. And then once the participants are in the
system, we need to build trust and relationships with them through content, through education, and through
services because the ultimate goal, as you said, is to convert them to a broader client. And when we first convert
them, we're reasonably indifferent whether they go into the self-directed channel, the FA channel, a virtual
channel because that'll just give us an opportunity to build that relationship, deepen that relationship. As the
clients' requirements and services and needs change, we'll be able to grow with them.
And so your comment about migrating one across – a wealth client across the different platforms will be the
ultimate goal. But first, we want to build trust with them, bring them into the Morgan Stanley relationship and then
try to – one of the keys is to try to have that integrated experience across the platforms for the client. So that's a
lot of the technology that we're trying to build, too. So we want to bring them in, deepen the relationship and then
let them go to the channel that best suits them.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kian Abouhossein Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on fixed income. As you know, you're a very credit
[indiscernible] (00:54:41) player, and clearly that's been performing extremely well. I just wanted to see how
you're thinking about that business more on a longer-term, more stable environment around credit and with your
macro pieces being a bit weaker. So can you talk a little bit about the mix and if you're happy about the mix or
what opportunities do you see to further grow the rates [indiscernible] (00:55:07) area?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
I think the short answer again is that we're very pleased with the performance from the fixed income business.
We've deepened the breadth of the franchise. As you said, credit has historically been a strong point for us, but
we're seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space. And so again,
we think we've gained market share since we've restructured this business. We're probably a 6% or 7% player
before; we're now probably a 10%, maybe even 10%-plus player. We would expect to maintain that market share
going forward, potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more. But we've been very pleased with the balance of
the business and the results over the last several years in this business.

Kian Abouhossein Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
And coming back to Archegos. I mean, you are a great number one PB player. But clearly, family offices and high
concentration with low transparency by clients is reflected by the margins that you take. So as a result, I'm sure
your risk office will take margins and do simulations on a, so to say, unwinding of the position. And in that, you
have lost significant amount of money. So I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about not just the
family office needs more disclosure needs to be reviewed but more around your margin requirement and how
you're thinking about your business in terms of risk management. And in that context, if you could also maybe
highlight to me if all your synthetic prime brokerage business is on a dynamic basis or on a fixed basis in terms of
margins?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I'll just make one comment and I'll let Jon add a couple of comments. But we've answered and addressed this
topic and I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity to talk about it in the future, but this is a pretty small part of what
we do as a whole firm. But I think the comment I want to make is family offices are not bad per se. I want to be
very clear about that. We have some phenomenal family office clients and they are all over the world, tremendous
institutions. So let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater here. This is not a judgment call on family offices.
This is a very idiosyncratic event. And I'll let Jon, if you want to add anything more to it, but I don't want to
overlabor this issue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would just, and I think just pulling some of the threads of your questions together, just make a couple
more observations. First, as we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios James mentioned, we're looking
at our stress testing methodology and we will recalibrate it if and where it's appropriate to do so, number one.
Your comment about margin and collateral, I mean, I think the way that we think about it is we had collateral
based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true. And as James mentioned it wasn't necessarily it was
a family office, it wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that
this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the Street and it wasn't
apparent to us. So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the
portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies, and we'll continue to be
diligent around all of those points.

get some thoughts on I guess, one, what the reaction was internally; and then two, just thoughts more broadly as
you're thinking about the crypto space across the organization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure, and I think your comments are very appropriate. It's a fast-growing space. There's a lot of interest in the
space. And we had significant interest from our Wealth clients to try to get access to this new asset class, and so
we tried to facilitate that. We've allowed, within our Wealth Management platform, qualified investors to get
access through two specific passive funds, if you will, that give access to the cryptocurrency. The uptake and the
interest level has been strong and we would expect people to continue to be interested in this space, and we'll
continue to monitor it and evolve. And we're in the business of trying to provide services and investment
opportunities that interest our client base. And as we continue to see more or stronger interest, we'll continue to
try to work with the regulators and others to provide services that we think are appropriate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. If I can squeeze in a quick follow-up here. Just on the SPAC market. Clearly, it has played a role.
And I think the record amount of investment banking activity in the market really started to lock up a bit over the
past month on the pipe side, and now the SEC is adding some more scrutiny here. So I'd just love to maybe think
about the backlogs there and expectations moving forward to kind of work through those backlogs. And then can
the IPO market kind of do a hand-off here, the traditional route of going public if the SPAC market slows?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I mean, listen, the SPAC or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or
a direct listing. And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very
active, very strong, and we've been a market leader in that space. You appropriately point out that the backlog, I
think, is over 200 SPACs on file, so I would expect that we'll continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a
pause as the market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it. So I don't want to get in front of that, but
there is clearly interest in this product both from an issuer and a buyer perspective, and I think it does also add to
some of the momentum in the M&A products.
But I'd also point out there's a couple hundred million dollars of sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put
into the M&A environment, but there's also $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firms. So if you put
multiples or leverage on those, there's a lot of buying power. So I think that's also a good driver of the M&A
market going forward.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Exane Paribas. Your line is now
open.

Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Hi there. Thank you. I wanted to carry on the discussion about the revenue growth drivers in Wealth Management
because I agree with you; I think the upside is huge from that. Is it too early to see signs of revenue synergy
between E*TRADE and the workplace channel and the advisor channels, whether it's customers bringing in
assets held away or starting to cross-over into other channels and use other services? I mean, can you see signs
of that yet or is it too soon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I mean, I think as I mentioned, we are seeing some anecdotal signs of that. We are running some pilot
programs. We think we're capturing some of the traditional E*TRADE clients who might have left that platform for
incremental advice, and now they're staying with us and working with our financial advisory platform. So I think
there's some very good early signs and I think you're seeing some of that obviously in the NNA. The other point I
would make is in terms of the workplace retention. When we announced the transaction, we targeted a 15%
retention rate there. It's early days but we're pleased with the progress that we're making. E*TRADE is still – the
E*TRADE platform retention rate is still well above 15%, so we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on
that. And as we get further along on this journey, we'll start to give you more color on that. But early anecdotes
are quite positive.

Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Okay. Great. And could I just ask a follow-up, a technical question on Archegos? And I know you're fed up with
this topic, but just a technical question. Does the fact of the loss, which is now in your data history, does that have
any mechanical calculation impact on risk weightings or capital requirements in your PB business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Again, the volatility related to this event was, as James said, was very short in terms of time series. So I think the
answer is it will not have a meaningful impact to the overall capital requirement.

Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Okay. Thank you very much.
