Thank you, Sylvia, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first quarter earnings call. On the call
with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following
their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On slide 2, you will see a
discussion of forward looking statements. Specifically, during the call you will hear references to various non-

GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at
www.ir.ameriprise.com.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward looking statements speak only as of

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward looking
statements can be found in our first quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders, our
2020 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. Below that you see our
adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting
the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James Michael Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release, Ameriprise is
off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters, as you can
see in our first quarter metrics and financial results.
Regarding the environment, equity markets continue to rally in the first quarter, as vaccinations increase and
activity accelerated with the US beginning to open back up. The economy is gaining strength with the further fiscal
stimulus, as well as better employment data.
With this backdrop, key for us is that we remain focused on serving our clients. Engagement is high, activity is
strong, and we're bringing in record client flows across the business.
We ended the quarter with assets under management and administration up 36% to $1.14 trillion, a new high. In
addition, we recently announced the strategic acquisition of the BMO EMEA Asset Management business.
Taking a step back and looking at Ameriprise overall, I feel really good. We're executing well and delivering on our
strategy for growth that we discussed with you. We continue to transform Ameriprise with Wealth Management
and Asset Management now representing over 75% of operating earnings.
You've seen the financials. Revenues are up 10% to over $3 billion. Earnings per share also increased nicely in
the quarter, up 27% ex the NOL benefit a year ago, even with low short term interest rates this year versus last
year's quarter. And ROE remains very strong at 30%.
While we continue to invest strongly in the business, we are managing expenses thoughtfully. With our strong
financial foundation and free cash flow generation, we returned more than $490 million to shareholders in the
quarter through dividends and our ongoing repurchase program, which is comparable to the last few quarters.
Yesterday, we announced another 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, our 17th increase since becoming public
16 years ago.
Let's discuss Advice & Wealth Management, where we've been executing well and driving growth. We're
benefiting from the strategic investments we've been making to deliver a differentiated client advisor experience
built on advice. We've been on a multi-year journey to take our client experience to the next level.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
A big part of that is the training and support we provide advisors and ensuring that the new digital tools and
capabilities are fully integrated within their technology ecosystem.
One of our more significant investments, our CRM platform, is increasingly serving as the hub for advisors,
allowing them to collaborate with clients while driving efficiencies. And we've seen good uptake as advisors
integrate these capabilities into their practices.
This strong engagement is helping to drive good client activity, excellent flows, and new client acquisition, as we
continue to build on our momentum from last year. Our total client net flows were strong at $9.3 billion in the
quarter, with total client assets up 36% to $762 billion.
Our investment advisory business continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were more than $10
billion, up 55% over last year. This is another record for us and reinforces our excellent client advisor engagement
and focus on organic growth.
Transactional activity continued gaining strength in the first quarter, picking up 12% over last year, with good
volume across a range of product solutions.
Even with clients putting more of their cash back to work, client cash balances remain elevated at more than $40
billion. And advisor productivity was strong, up 8%, adjusting for interest rates.
And we're bringing on new advisors. Our virtual recruiting program is driving good results with 93 advisors joining
us in the quarter. Advisors recognize what we have to offer in terms of our culture, technology, and high level of
support.
And as more states reopen their businesses and economies, we're looking forward to connecting with more
advisors in person, as we move through the balance of the year.
We also continue to build out the Ameriprise Bank, where total assets grew to $8.8 billion in the quarter. As we
discussed, we plan to move additional deposits to the bank over the course of this year.
Pledge and margin loan volumes increased nicely in the quarter, as our advisors engaged with their clients with
our lending solutions from a liquidity perspective.
Wrapping up AWM, even with interest rates at all-time lows, AWM margin increased 90 basis points sequentially,
ending the quarter at a strong 20.7%.
Turning to our Retirement & Protection Solutions business, we're off to a good start and continue to adapt to the
low interest rate environment. We have been very proactive in this climate as we serve client needs and prudently
manage the business.
Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 33%, driven by our success of structured product, as well as our
annuities without living benefits. As a result, the percentage of VA sales without living benefits grew to 64% of
total sales in the quarter.
With regard to insurance, our focus has been on our flagship VUL product rather than IUL. In fact, VUL sales
were up 76%. We're focused on making sure we have the right product for this rate environment, while
maintaining strong underwriting.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Overall, I feel good about how the Retirement & Protection Solutions business is performing in this challenging
environment. As part of this strategy, we are actively pursuing a reinsurance transaction for the remaining closed
block of fixed annuities. And we feel we can execute it in the near term.
Turning to Asset Management, we're generating strong results. Our team is engaged, serving clients evolving
needs well and driving profitable growth.
I'll speak to the strength of the quarter and then comment on BMO's EMEA acquisition. With the continuation of
positive flows in markets, assets under management were up significantly, increasing 32% to $564 billion.
We're investing in the business, including in transforming how we use data. This is both within investments in
terms of our use of data in our research as well as in distribution. In addition, and also key, is the thought
leadership we provide and how we are targeting the right advisors to drive meaningful engagement.
Regarding investment performance, our teams consistently generate strong performance for our clients. It's
across all categories, equities, fixed income, and asset allocation strategies. As an active manager, our research
expertise is a key differentiator.
I'd highlight the Columbia Threadneedle, ranked in the top 10 over the one-, five-, and 10-year time frames in the
recent Barron's Best Fund Family ranking, one of only two firms that ranked in the top 10 across all time periods.
We also won seven [Refinitiv] Lipper [Fund] Awards in the US this year and over 22 awards in EMEA over the last
year. This level of performance bodes very well in terms of earning future flows.
At quarter end, Columbia Threadneedle had 103 four- and five-star Morningstar rated funds globally, which
represented close to 70% of our assets. This shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup.
So with this type of investment performance and the strong execution of our plan, you saw that flows continue to
be quite strong. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $4.9 billion, an improvement of $7.3 billion from a year ago.
Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $6.2 billion.
Global Retail net inflows were $4.6 billion, largely driven by the traction we're seeing in North America. We're
driving high engagement with clients and intermediaries, including with the larger broker dealers and
independents.
Sales and flows traction is broad, and we're working hard to maintain that. In the quarter, we had nine funds that
generated over $250 million in net inflows, including five equity and four fixed income funds.
In EMEA, we've seen good flows in Continental Europe in a number of key markets. In the UK, we remained in
outflows. However, we saw improvement in the quarter as the economy started to reopen there more fully. And
we're hopeful that investor settlement will strengthen.
In terms of Global Institutional, we had net inflows of $1.6 billion, ex legacy partner outflows, driven by our results
in EMEA. We've made considerable progress in strengthening our consultant relations and client service globally.
Consultants have increased their ratings on a number of key strategies in recent quarters. This is important in
terms of our ability to gain additional mandates from existing clients and grow our sales pipeline.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
As you saw earlier this month, we announced our strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management
business. The acquisition is right in line with our strategy that we consistently discussed with you.
It will add complementary capabilities and solutions with their established strengths in responsible investing,
liability driven investing, fiduciary outsource management, and European real estate. It will also expand our scale
in other traditional asset classes, especially in European fixed income. And recent flow trends in their EMEA
business have been favorable.
In addition, post close, BMO's North American Wealth Management clients will have the opportunity to access a
broad range of Columbia Threadneedle investment management solutions.
From an asset management perspective, we gain important geographic diversity. Upon close, EMEA's AUM will
increase significantly to 40% of total AUM at Columbia Threadneedle, which provides a good balance to the US
business.
We've always been a disciplined acquirer. And we expect this transaction will add to our strategic growth and
generate a good return over time. Importantly, as we execute it, the team will remain focused on maintaining our
strong business momentum.
So for Ameriprise overall, we're in an excellent position. The business is performing really well and delivering
strong results. Based on the current environment, we feel comfortable that we'll continue to generate strong
returns with a strong balance sheet and substantial free cash flow.
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail. And then we'll take your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, which
are a direct result of our continued execution of the strategic priorities. We continued to demonstrate strong
performance in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, driven by
ongoing organic growth and expense discipline.
At the core, we remain focused on accelerating our mix shift through specific actions. For example, our recently
announced strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business will expand key capabilities in
attractive and growing market segments, while also adding to traditional asset classes. This provides a larger
combined capability to meet client needs.
We have high confidence in the financial benefits from the acquisition as well. It will be accretive on our cash and
operating basis by 2023, generating a 20%-plus IRR, and have a payback period consistent with the Columbia
acquisition of eight years.
In addition, we have established a strong partnership with BMO in North America, which we expect to generate
strong profits. We are actively engaged in a fixed annuity reinsurance process and anticipate finalizing the
transaction shortly.
Lastly, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile and continued profit mix shift to lower risk and higher
margin retirement and protection solution offerings. Our diversified model continues to generate robust free cash

flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We remain on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted
operating earnings to shareholders in 2021.
Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise's strong underlying business performance and activity levels in our core growth
businesses continue to neutralize headwinds from short term interest rates. As a reminder, this will be the last
quarter where we have a reduction in short rates, distorting the year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact
from interest, Ameriprise adjusted net operating revenue grew 13%.
Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses profitability continues to increase, with
adjusted pre-tax operating earnings up 35%.
General and administrative expenses continue to be well-managed. Excluding the impact of share price
appreciation on compensation, G&A expenses were up 2%, as we remain disciplined, executing reengineering
initiatives.
In total, we delivered excellent underlying EPS growth of 27%, excluding the net operating loss tax benefit and
very strong margins in the quarter.
Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth Management continued to deliver excellent organic growth
during the quarter, with total client assets up 36% to $762 billion.
In response to the request from many of you, we are now disclosing total client flows, which increased 21% to
$9.3 billion.
From a product perspective, we had a terrific growth in our wrap flows, up 55% to $10.4 billion. Cash balances
remain elevated at $40.4 billion, with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future.
On page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were strong, with underlying adjusted operating
earnings up 30% to $389 million after the $78 million interest rate headwind. Adjusted operating net revenues
were up 16% to $1.9 billion, driven by client flows, improved transaction activity, and higher market levels. On a
sequential basis, revenues increased 6% from strong performance, despite fewer fee days in the current quarter.
Expenses remain well-managed. And we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. G&A expense increased
only 2% and included higher volume related expenses, bank expansion, investments for future growth, and
elevated share based compensation.
Pre-tax adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. Adjusting for interest rates, the margin would have been 215 basis
points higher. On a sequential basis, pre-tax operating earnings increased 11%. And pre-tax adjusted operating
margin expanded 90 basis points.
Turning to page 9. The significant growth in Asset Management was due to our investment engine that is driving
revenue growth through consistent investment performance and compelling thought leadership, leading to
increased client engagement. Net inflows in the quarter were $6.2 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, an
$8 billion improvement from a year ago.
Adjusted operating revenues increased 21% to $828 million, reflecting cumulative benefit of inflows, favorable mix
shift toward equity strategies, and market appreciation. The prior year quarter included an unfavorable impact
from our performance fee adjustment.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
General and administrative expenses grew 12% from higher compensation expense related to strong
performance, Ameriprise share appreciation, as well as the costs associated with increased activity levels.
Adjusted for compensation related expense, G&A increased a more moderate 5%.
Putting this together, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 45% with a 43.9% margin. We continue to be very
encouraged by the continuation of positive flow trends and strong profitability.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market
and rate environment. While we have a strong book of business from a risk perspective, we continue to execute
our strategy to improve it further. In the quarter, 64% of retirement product sales did not have living benefit
guarantees. This sales shift is already having an impact on our in-force block, with the account value of living
benefit riders down from 65% to 63%.
In protection, sales were flat, as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher margin VUL and a significant
decline in Index Universal Life. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward.
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings increased 10% to
$183 million. We had a steep drop-off in claims following January's high level. And we were approaching pre-
COVID levels of claims by the end of March. This business is very well-managed. Net amount at risk remains
among the lowest in the industry. And our hedging remains very effective.
Let's turn to page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $21 million loss in the quarter, which was a
$29 million improvement from the prior year.
Excluding closed blocks, the loss in the corporate segment was $63 million, which included a $15 million
investment gain, largely offset by $11 million of higher share based compensation expense. The year ago quarter
had $11 million benefit from Ameriprise share price depreciation.
Long-term care had $46 million of earnings in the quarter. The high COVID-related mortality and terminations we
saw in January declined in February and March and were approaching pre-COVID levels by the end of March.
This benefit was partially offset by the COVID claims level on life insurance.
Fixed annuities had a $4 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. As I mentioned, we are making
good progress on our fixed annuity reinsurance transaction.
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong,
including our liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $2 billion, 96%
hedge effectiveness in the quarter, and a defensely positioned investment portfolio.
Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 30%. We returned $491 million to
shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback. We just announced a 9% increase in our quarterly
dividend. And we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders
this year.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Jim, Walter, was hoping to start maybe with some
trends you guys have seen in Advice & Wealth Management. And obviously, another really strong quarter,
particularly in the wrap account flows, as you pointed out, over $10 billion. And thanks for the new disclosure on
the $9 billion for total.
I guess the first question is there, just kind of around sustainability, particularly in the wrap flows. And maybe we
can tackle it from a perspective of kind of giving us a breakdown of how much of this is coming from existing
clients sort of reengaging, given the fact that market backdrop is better? Versus new assets coming from either
recruiting or same store sales?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, Alex, this is Jim. Good morning. So I think we're seeing good growth coming from all of the areas you've
mentioned.
We see a good additional flow coming from current clients, as we're deepening through the advice relationship
that we've been really having our advisors really engage with clients on and the deepening.
But we also see good new organic growth from client acquisition coming in as well from our advisors. And as a
complement from recruits that we've added over the last year, as they transfer their book, they're bringing over
some of the clients.
But I would say, it's a lot coming from the organic growth from our core base, both for new clients that our
advisors are bringing in as well as current clients, where they're deepening the relationship and bringing in more
of those flows as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's great to hear. Shifting gears, maybe we can touch on the BMO acquisition. I was hoping to get a
little more details on that property.
So it sounds like the flows there are positive. Maybe you can talk to sort of the sources of growth and kind of what
products are driving flows in that asset?
And I guess more importantly, are you thinking about any risks from attrition, as we can typically see in an asset
management acquisition.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
And then from a financial perspective, I guess, Walter, that one is for you. I think I heard you say accretion to
operating earnings by 2023. I think you guys are paying for this with cash.
So I guess, why is the deal not immediately accretive? And I guess within the same lines, maybe kind of help us
with a jumping off point for revenues and pre-tax income, pre and post synergies for that asset. I know, a bunch of
things in there, but strategic and financial highlights would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So what I can say really is that we know right now that the EMEA BMO area is in inflows for the last
number of months through the first quarter. They're seeing it in some of their core programs and initiatives.
The ones that we sort of laid out to you are the strategic capabilities that we think that will really enhance and
strengthen our areas to really get a more formal presence on the continent there, but also that we could leverage
globally.
We feel like as we go through this transaction, since we're not really, what I would call, meshing together both
investment process or distribution capabilities in some of those areas, they're more of an add-on to us, that we
shouldn't suffer, as you mentioned, a bit more of a attrition going through that process.
We feel very comfortable that we're adding their people, we're adding their capabilities. And what we're spending
more time integrating will be more of the back and middle offices. Adding our capabilities, which are much more
state-of-the-art, much more current in what we can provide them technology-wise and support-wise.
And so we feel like it could be a win-win. We always factor in, when we do a transaction, there is always some
breakage. You can't really determine how much it is. But we always factor in that in thinking about a deal.
But we're hoping that that would be one that will not be significant, based on what we're looking to do here, which
is very different than merging and integrating front offices and people from that standpoint.
We like their capabilities. We think that those capabilities with our added distribution globally can actually enhance
their flow picture as well. But we didn't count on the revenue flows when we did the deal to make it like a make-or-
break. We really look at this from having the cost synergies from the back and middle office, plus what they think
they can grow, plus what we can add in. And then we complement that with our distribution as a plus.
And so we feel like this is really good strategic, is exactly what we were looking for. As a complement, it is one
that we can easily handle through the excess cash and balance sheet that we have. And it doesn't take away from
the organic growth that we want our people to continue to focus on in the Asset Management business.

Walter Stanley Berman A

Yeah, so, Alex, it's Walter. So obviously, the BMO is generating EBITDA. But again, it's a division of a large
corporation. So commenting on that number would be a little problematic.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
We've certainly have done our analysis of it. But the big reason, obviously, for the accretion in 2023 is the
substantial amount of one-time expense that we will be absorbing between now and that timeframe.
We feel very comfortable, and that's why we gave you the bookends as relates to the IRR on it. And the –
certainly, the elements of payback. So we are working through right now. And certainly, we'll keep you abreast as
we go through this and get additional information as we feel good about the fundamentals of it.

Alexander Blostein Q

Got you. And as we find with a typical kind of M&A transaction, are these integration charges going to be backed

Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Asset Management and the very strong margin that you guys
reported in the quarter, the 43.9%, well above your 34% to 39% target.
So was there anything unusual in there that we should think about perhaps normalizing in the balance of the
year? And relatedly, what kind of gets you back down into the range? Is there an expectation that maybe
investment spending will increase in the back half? Just want to get a sense of the trajectory of the margin.
Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. There's nothing unusual in this quarter, Suneet, what we do and gain the benefit of deleveraging and the
fact that we do not have a wind in our face as it relates to the outflows. So it's really from that standpoint.
It's solid performance on the inflows. And we feel the expenses will remain well-managed as we go forward. But it
is really the benefit of the inflows and the market. There's nothing unusual.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And when we look at going forward longer term, I mean in the current period, if markets hold, we don't see that
reverting back to in the 30s at this point in time.
I think longer term, it's hard for us because there's a business mix, as we said, even adding the BMO transaction,
which is largely institutional. There will be some differences there just on fee, not that they don't have – they have
good fees, but on a relative compared to our retail side.
So there are those various things. And as you know, there's always a mix change that occurs over the longer term
and based on markets and a number of other factors. But from a cost perspective, we do not see anything that
would cause a problem.
And from a revenue, you can see that our fee basis has been holding pretty well, based on new assets that we're
adding versus anything that are trading. So it's nothing in the near term. It's just longer term, it's hard to predict.
We'll have to do some further work, depending on what happens over the course of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. And then on the retail flows, can you give us a sense of how much of that activity is coming from A&WM
versus the third party channels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. I would say, overall, we're getting very strong flows from our third party channel. Ameriprise has picked up a
bit. But in totality, it's really coming from the third party channels.
And so I would say, we feel really good. We've actually grown our share in seven of the eight top distributors in
the US. We're getting it from a number of different disciplines, the broker dealers, the independents, RIAs, et
cetera.
So we feel very good. And we have a broader lineup that is actually selling pretty well. This is actually a time
when even fixed income kicked in for us. Where we were more equity, now we're combination of getting good
equity and fixed income has picked up as well. So we really feel good about the broadening there.

Got it. And then just the last one for me, if I could. Just on M&A more broadly. Obviously, the BMO transaction is
what you're focused on. But anything that you guys are still needing to or desiring to have from an M&A
perspective? Or do you pretty much have what you need post BMO in-house?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We actually feel like the BMO was one of the primary areas that we wanted to really complement, which is
growing a bit more and balancing out for more of the solutions oriented business, a little more institutional
business, a little more weight for our distribution, particularly in that area for EMEA.
So we feel like that was our primary focus in what we were looking to do, if we did an incremental acquisition right
now. And we want to concentrate on getting that integrated well.
We feel like we got good momentum in the core of the businesses, both in the US as well as what we think we
could expand internationally with some of our capabilities now, institutional as well with the product set we have.
We got some very good consultant approvals and ratings, which we think will expand our platform capabilities for
distribution.
So we're feeling pretty good about that. That was one of the things that we wanted to focus on in the near term.
And we think that this deal gives us some of that ability here.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And thanks actually for the total client flow disclosure, the net
new assets across the Wealth Management business. Certainly that helps to show the strength of the business.
Was curious if it's possible to get a longer historical time series for that data?
And maybe for right now, how indicative is the roughly 5% total organic growth rate that is reflected in the three
quarters that you disclosed? Like how does that compare over time to the sort of organic growth rate implied by
the total client flows over a period of a few years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I think I'll have Walter respond a little. What I can say is that, and we've always sort of mentioned, we
feel like the numbers – and I think Walter's team is trying to reconcile going back based on the definitions being
utilized, which is I think the ones being utilized in the industry a little more today.
Our client flows, we think, are pretty close to sort of our wrap flows. There may have been a period just after the
sort of the discussion on the DOL, et cetera, where there was more of a shift from some brokerage activity to the
wrap, that we saw some blips in some of those initial quarters.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
But I think if you go back over the last number of quarters, you probably see more of a client flow close to, again,
the wrap flows. There may be some timing issues quarter to quarter, et cetera. But I think that's along the lines,
Walter. But I – you know more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So right now, we're working on that. And so we will follow-up and get you to 2020. But what Jim is saying, I
believe, is a good representation of it. So if you give us a chance, we'll get that out, as we look at the new
definitions and the other things as – of the data, okay?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Great. Thank you for that. Much appreciated. And then – and helpful to have the high level indication.
Thank you.
So for my follow-up, another question on AWM. It was really good to see advisor head count pick up here this
quarter. So why not get a little bit more aggressive on the recruiting front or bolt-on M&A to try to grow that head
count more rapidly?
Effectively, when we look across a lot of the wealth management peers that get the best valuation in the stock,
tend to have solid growth in net new assets and in advisors. And obviously churn is an impact.
And so what steps do you think you can take to continue to kind of grind down churn? And then – and is maybe
picking up on the aggression for recruiting something that you think is compelling at this point, given where the
market is for advisors? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, good question. I think the way I would probably answer that would be that we will continue to look at
bringing in good advisors to the firm. And we could probably – a bit more there, and we're reviewing it.
But very important for us, we want to bring in the right advisors that fit the brand, the culture, the compliance,
understand what their focus on, growth. We don't want to just pay advisers to join us or be part of a network and
process for them. We want to have advisers join us that we can help grow their productivity, grow their client
relationships, have great client satisfaction, be with us a long time.
That really builds on the culture and the brand. We think we have a great value proposition for advisers once they
join us, both from how we onboard them, how we give them support, the leadership, the technology, the
capabilities. We just don't want to roll up a bunch of firms or independents and just associate and process for
them, per se.
So that's very important to us. I think we could probably – maybe we could be more aggressive out there. And –
but we also think it's very important for the long term.
The other thing we really spend a lot of time, different than other competitors about just rolling up advisors, is that
we focus on our 10,000 advisors growing their productivity, having strong client satisfaction. And I think when you
compare us, the last time we did that analysis, which we update, we were more than 2.5 times any independent
14

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
on annual productivity growth on a compounded basis for a long period of time. And the same thing against the
wirehouses.
So that's where we put a lot more of our energy. But to your point, we complement that with having good recruits
and having good retention. And we'll continue to look at whether we could step that up, where there maybe some
other firms, smaller firms suited to our cultural mix. But that's what we've been focused on, and we've been
successful with it.

Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey, good morning. Wanted to go back to the Advice & Wealth and that $10.4 billion in net wrap flows, just a
phenomenal number. And I'm kind of thinking back to pre-COVID, and it seems like a normalized range and a
very good range would have been $4 billion to $5 billion. And it's kind of gradually jumped up. And now I'm
looking at the deposit base of $40.4 billion.
And so my question is, what's the right strike zone for wrap net flows? Is it $10 billion? Is it $6 billion to $8 billion?
Where do you think the normalized number is? And given $40.4 billion in deposits, what can we look toward in the
near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Andrew, I think it was a very good question. You or someone else or some of the people that had asked from
the fourth quarter on a similar basis when we had a good pickup in flows and client activity as well.
What we've been seeing is – and it's probably a combination of factors. I mean we have a reopening of the
economy. I think people are starting to feel a bit more comfortable. I think the markets have done well. So there's
a little bit of that, where people feel a little more comfortable in what they are doing right now. And so I think that's
part of it, because of the positive nature of the reopening and the vaccine rolling out, et cetera.
But I also feel part of it is a level of engagement that our advisors are also having with their clients. We've really
rolled out our whole foundational advice in complement to our comprehensive advice.
We have over 0.5 million of our clients already have [ph] goals (45:09) online that are very active with. We have
been rolling out our integrated technology and the way our advisors can continue to connect with clients and
understand the nature of what conversations they should be having. We'll be rolling out more tools along those
lines.
So we feel like we've stepped up our level of having the advisors engage with the clients and giving them a lot
more of the tools and capabilities to do that more seamlessly in an integrated fashion.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
And I think that's having some effect. I mean it's hard for me not knowing the market cycle and some of the things
popping up around. But I feel good that we're going to continue to – at least continue to gain those type of flows. I
can't predict whether it's 9, 10, 8, 6, or whatever. But I feel like we're in a good spot right now. And we're very
focused on helping that to continue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. So good, very good momentum. And then thinking about the long term care block, which earned $46
million, versus what one would normally expect to be breakeven. And I suspect there were some COVID effects
that caused that uptick in earnings. Where do you see earnings going over the near and intermediate term in that
line item?
And then secondly, given that rates have come up a bit – a lot in the last 12 months. Do you think that there's a
stronger possibility that you could divest of that block? Is there interest?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Walter, with you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So, Andrew, on the $46 million, that is the realization of unfortunately the mortality and lower basically new
entrants into nursing home, so the frequency.
So as we indicated, that is starting to slow off – or slow down in March. It basically dropped to around $5 million.
So we're seeing – we're gauging it. And certainly, we've gotten the benefit of the situation with COVID.
And we're – but we have our programs that are working. As we indicated, our benefit of programs, our price
increases and other things, and the claims are being well-managed and staying within expectation. So we – I can't
say, but certainly by the trend, it's slowing down now as it relates to the situation with COVID.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
And just interest in the block itself from acquirers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We again, certainly the interest will – interest rates certainly affect that. And we certain – we will evaluate any
certainly bids coming in. And – but then we are open to evaluate elements within that. But again, we feel we have
this, the LTC, under control. But certainly we would look at opportunities to reinsure that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
And maybe if I could just sneak one quick one in at the end. Just G&A overall was up 2%, ex the effect of the
stock and so forth.
16


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
So as we look forward, and hopefully the market opens up, could you give any insight into what we could expect
would be the overall growth in G&A, given that travel and entertainment might pick up. Do you think we could see
a real sharp pickup in G&A? Or do you have ways to just kind of keep it under control as we move forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
It's more the latter. I think that we – as you noted, we are managing our expenses well. And even with the return
to more T&E and other things of that nature, we believe we will stay in a more controlled situation with that.
And as normally we get questions on AWM, the range on that is, you saw 2%. And we think it's going to be in the
3%, 4% range. So well-managed as we go forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. A few follow-ups on AWM. Yeah, appreciate that new disclosure on total enterprise flows as well.
I guess if we split those two businesses, Walter, how did the revenue yields and margins compare between wrap
and non-wrap businesses for you? Because clearly your flows are being driven by wrap. Our presumption has
been wrap has much higher margins and fee yield. But just curious if you can quantify that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, listen, we had very strong transactional activity in this quarter. So obviously that drove a good profitability for
us. And as we look at it, the margins and the profitability of these programs, it's they are both very good. There's
timing.
As you know in wrap, you get your fee as it relates to it on the transactional. You'll take it upfront or spread it over
– back-load it.
So the profitabilities of these are certainly with – [ph] from AWM (50:38) standpoint, extremely good. And
distinguishing between them, they're just different. And they fit into the competent retirement approach that we
take. So they're necessary for our clients, but they all generate good acceptable returns to us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. And, Walter, just to follow-up on that. So from your perspective, there's not meaningfully better margins if
you I guess normalize and spread them out over the life of the business between wrap and non-wrap. Would that
be a fair characterization? Or are they just different?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
They're different, and they both generate good returns for us. They really do. On the surface, they are different
and different characterizations to meet different needs. But – and timing of profitability. But they both really do
generate acceptable and good returns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And then just a question on the weighted average gross fee yield for the cash type deposits you break out.
Last quarter was 69 basis points. This quarter, it was 65 basis points. The rate of change is clearly slowing.
Given what interest rates have done recently, do you think we're near a bottom? Assuming there, clients continue
to maintain these high balances in these accounts, do you think we're closer to a bottom or levelizing? Or do you
think that we might still see a little downward pressure on the margins?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I don't see downward pressure on the margins. I do see, obviously we're evaluating, from our standpoint, the
investment and opportunities that we have for that product and certainly looking now at duration versus credit.
But I would say it certainly has slowed, as you noted. But I can't say whether it's bottomed, [ph] David (52:28). But
it's certainly slowed, and we're evaluating now, looking at both the asset side of it. And then we'll see what
happens on the short end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. And then one final one. Just the fixed annuity transaction. I think the expectation was it would
garner approximately $700 million, I believe. Interest rates have changed meaningfully though. I don't know
whether that would meaningfully impact your execution price on that or not.
And then also just to confirm, are you guys really at this point just focused on an isolated fixed annuity deal? Or
how have you considered broadening out, whether that's, to Andrew's question, long term care or variable
annuities or life insurance? Or at this point it's really just fixed annuities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, right now, we're focused on fixed annuities. As Jim and I have indicated, we are working on that to bring that
to closure. And yes, interest rates do affect it. But we – the range that you're talking about should be certainly
achieved from that standpoint.
And as I indicated to Andrew, we do get constant requests for evaluation of different offers. And we evaluate
them. But right now, we're focusing on the fixed annuity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On the transactional activity in AWM, can you give us any sense of if it's remained
elevated as you have gone through April?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, I believe it is continuing. Again, this is preliminary information coming in. But yes, we're seeing still continuing
trends.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. And then on the fixed annuity reinsurance, do you view that as providing additional capacity for buybacks
above and beyond the 90% that you target? Or should we think about that more as replenishing capital that you'll
use for the BMO transaction?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, again, we are sitting in strong capital position now, as we indicate. Our excess capital is in $2 billion.
Certainly, we're going to generate strong capital, free cash flow. And going forward, this – yes, that this
transaction, we'll replenish. You can look at it that way, the BMO transaction.
And then we make our decisions and looking opportunistically, what's the best way to deploy that? But at this
stage, we're sitting in very good position. And certainly, the fixed annuity transaction will certainly offset the BMO
substantially.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then just to confirm that the 90% capital return target is just buybacks and dividends and excludes the M&A,
is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
That's right. We've been – yes, our 90% is buyback and dividends. Right.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you could just remind us how sensitive
Ameriprise's earnings – and specifically within the Advice & Wealth Management, how sensitive the earnings
could be to any potential Fed funds rate increase? And more specifically, just wondering whether you could
potentially see a benefit immediately? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The answer is you will see a benefit on – if you're talking about AWM – on the Fed funds. And so if you look
at, say, $25 billion, looking at just concentrating on sweep accounts, it's $250 million over a year period on 1%
increase, right? That's the dimensions of it. And then it's a matter of gauging how we return that to the client.
But normally, you have a differential between when the Fed fund changes. And then we evaluate the competitive
situation. That's trying to dimension it from that standpoint that makes sense. Okay?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may. Wondering within the Asset Management side,
wonder if you could just talk about some of the contribution that you're seeing from any solutions based
mandates? And wonder if you'd also just share with us how this could potentially change once the BMO EMEA
Asset Management acquisition is integrated? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So institutionally and even from a retail, we've been getting sort of mandates a little more that are solutions
oriented.
And we also, as you also know, have a UK real estate property business, and we have a smaller US business as
well. So this would complement it nicely and bring some of that advanced capability in Europe to bear.
We know ESG is very big, and they're a leader in ESG as well. And we've been ramping up our activities in ESG
in the UK for European activity and UK activity.
So overall, we feel like it'll help us hit the ground running further in Europe. But we're also looking to further use
that solution capability, complementing what we're already doing in the US for the US. And we think that that will
give us a greater ability to bring in more solutions oriented business over the longer term.
So I don't know if that answers your question. But we had invested in solutions. We do have some of the different
strategies already coming to bear for some of what we're doing internationally and domestically. But this would
advance us further.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Thank you. Just hoping you can provide some more color on the potential opportunity from the BMO Wealth
Management relationship in the US? And how meaningful could this be in terms of incremental flows or AUM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So in the US, we're looking to first provide our platform capabilities to BMO Wealth Management. But in
addition, we'll be looking to convert some of their activities over to us on the retail side for us to actually manage
those activities for them.
And we're working with BMO now. We've crafted a relationship and a arrangement on that. We're not purchasing
their US business. But we're working on sort of an agreement, a revenue-type agreement as well as a distribution
agreement to pick up a level of their activities there.
I don't have more detailed information right now. Walter, I don't know if you have it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, not at this moment. And I think we are just working from that standpoint to transfer clients over, and we're
discussing with them, just as Jim has indicated. And anything we've talked about before as related to the
financials, that does not include that aspect of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. So this would all be potential upside in terms of kind of revenue synergies as well as – obviously you don't
have the assets. So there's no attrition. It would all be wins that would kind of be incremental flows in the US to
the extent they emerge?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A

Yes.
