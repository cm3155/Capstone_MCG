M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Those of you that have followed for a while, know and expect I'm going to begin every quarterly
earnings call with this dashboard of what we believe are the primary things that matter over time in terms of bank
performance. GAAP measures first followed by the non-GAAP measures, which provide the best insight into what
I focus on and consequently what we focus on at Pinnacle.
My guess is that, as 2Q earnings continue to roll out we'll see some pretty wide variability in performance among
the banks, but for us 2Q was a really good quarter. On an adjusted basis, we grew revenues 11.7% linked quarter
annualized, EPS 10.8% linked quarter annualized and pre-tax pre-provision net income 24.8% linked quarter
annualized. We continued the dramatic growth in loans and deposits at 11.3%, 9.1% linked quarter annualized,
respectively, which are generally the best predictors of our ability to continue growing revenue and earnings going
forward.
Tangible book value per share grew meaningfully during the quarter, aided by a sale leaseback transaction that
Harold will review in greater detail shortly. And the key asset quality metrics like NPA, classified assets and net
charge-offs continued to hold up extremely well. So, in summary, second quarter was a great quarter for us. Now
I'm going to let Harold review the quarter in greater detail and I'll come back and give some thoughts on the
shares later.

Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We will again start with deposits reporting linked quarter annualized
average growth of 12% and the second quarter was again a real positive for us. As we've mentioned previously
growing deposits in 2023 is a key focus. And the second quarter was another indication that obtaining deposits in
an environment where competitors can be fairly unpredictable is very much doable for this franchise. Several
factors contributed to increased deposit rates in the second quarter. Competitive pressures were heightened
during the quarter, primarily from large regional banks offering rate specials at some fairly incredible rates in an
apparent effort to achieve funding goals. We also have an important public funds client base with much of these
balances being tied to Fed funds.
Lastly, the mix shift of reduced non-interest-bearing to interest bearing continued in the second quarter, albeit at a
lesser pace. All of these factors contribute to average deposit cost increasing to 2.52%, with a spot rate at quarter
end of 2.77%. We're optimistic about the pace of deposit rate increases as we head into the third quarter. Several
factors to consider, over the last few weeks, our cost do not appear to be moving up at the same pace as we
experienced at the end of the first quarter and most of the second quarter have contributed to this slower pace

and the slowing of the mix shift of deposits from non-interest-bearing to interest bearing. Also, we intend to reduce
the absolute size of our more expensive wholesale funding base in the third quarter by absorbing some of the
added liquidity which had been acquired over the last few months.
In other words, we do not believe we need to be nearly as aggressive on gathering funding as we have been over
the last few months. Deposit rates will continue to increase in the second half of this year as we hopefully
approach a terminal value for Fed funds. We just believe with all the liquidity noise in the first half of the year, a
more deliberate stance for gathering deposits available to us as we move into the third quarter.
Lastly in the supplemental slides is more information on uninsured deposits, which are down to 28% of total
deposits at quarter end. We won't go into this on the call, but just making sure everyone knows the information is
there. The second quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us; that said our line leadership
successfully managed our loan growth down to the 11% linked quarter annualized rate.
We're maintaining our loan guidance for 2023 at low- to mid-teens growth. As we mentioned over the last several
quarters, we've tightened the credit box for construction and deployed more discipline on loan pricing, which
should serve to reduce our normally outsized growth.
Spreads on floating and variable rate loans have continued to be very respectable. We also are seeing spreads
on fixed rate lending improved given emphasis by our line leadership. Our loan line, thus far, is essentially the
same as the deposit beta, which we believe reflects a great deal of effort on the part of our relationship managers.
Our aim with respect to loan pricing is to maintain our spreads on floating and variable rate loans and achieve 7%
to 8% plus yields on both new and renewed fixed-rate paper.
As the top chart reflects, our GAAP NIM decreased 20 basis points, which is more than we anticipated at the start
of the quarter. As we noted last quarter, out of an abundance of caution, our average liquidity increased by
approximately $1.2 billion in cash during the second quarter. And our quarter end liquidity is slightly higher. So we
have a lot of cash going in the third quarter, which should help us eliminate some wholesale funding as well as
provide for loan growth in the second half of the year.
Contributing to the cash build this quarter was the impact of the sale leaseback transactions. We mentioned in a
press release last night. We received approximately $199 million from the sale of non-earning fixed assets. We
also sold $174 million from the sale of investment securities. These two transactions allowed us to reposition
under-earning assets into interest-bearing cash in order to eliminate the negative near-term impact from
increased lease cost. Our rate forecast is consistent with most rate forecasts out there. We're optimistic that a
July raise by the Fed is the terminal point for Fed funds. But we may be slightly more pessimistic and that we
don't see rate decreases occurring until mid to late 2024.
With that, our forecast for the rest of 2023 is that quarterly net interest income will likely be flat to slightly up from
the second quarter results. As for credit, we again are presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan
portfolio continued to perform very well in the second quarter. Our belief is that credit should remain fairly
consistent for the remainder of this year. We did increase the ratio of our allowance for credit losses to total loans
during the quarter to 1.08%. We reworked several of our CECL models during the quarter and are implementing
these changes this quarter. We don't anticipate salary increases during the second half of 2023. Any increases
from this point should be fairly modest dependent, we believe, primarily on macro trends.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
As noted for the last few quarters, we continue to have a very limited, if any, appetite for new construction. Also,
the CRE appetite chart on the bottom right is basically unchanged from the prior quarter, but does give you a real
perspective on how we have reduced our appetite in commercial real estate over the last year or more.
In summary, our outlook for a loan portfolio from a credit respective remain strong. So if negative macro trends
begin to develop, we believe we're advantaged as we enter any potential recession from a position of strength.
Again and consistent with last time more information around credit. The top left chart deals with trends in
construction originations. We began reducing, eliminating our appetite for new construction originations last
summer, which is consistent with the chart.
The chart would indicate that our limited appetite is largely concentrated in warehouse, multi-family, and
residential. A quick note about new residential commitments. The gold bars on the chart are new lines for new
homes under old guidance lines for a limited set of long term residential builders.
We continue to support our resi builders under guidance lines that have been in place, in some cases for years.
As you likely know, residential builders are very busy right now given the state of the housing market and the lack
of existing home inventories, which is especially relevant in our markets, which have a lot of in-migration from
around the country.
Secondly, the chart on the top left, top right, we are providing updated information about the status of maturities
for CRE and construction fixed rate loans. Our yield target for these loans has increased into the 7% to 8% range.
Two comments regarding this chart. The absolute size of the fixed rate volumes coming up for renewal remains
manageable and that with rental increases over the last 3 years to 5 years and occupancy levels remaining
strong, we believe that our borrowers will continue to be able to afford the incremental interest cost.
Additionally, our underwriting for several years has required that any new commercial real estate or construction
commitment be underwritten at higher rates than the contract rate, which in most cases is 200 to 300 basis points
higher.
Again, we believe our borrowers have the resources to afford these increased rates, both due to increased
revenues on their part and based on our previous conclusions from our underwriting practices.
Now onto fees and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG, the impact of the gain of sale
fixed assets and the loss on the sale of investment securities fee revenues were up slightly from the first quarter.
That said, we're pleased with the effort of our fee-generating units during what is proving to be a challenging
banking environment. We continue to anticipate that fee revenues, excluding BHG and all of these other items will
come in at around a high-single-digit growth rate for 2023 over 2022.
Linked quarter expenses were essentially flat as personnel costs were down and other expenses were up by
similar amounts. Seasonal decreases in payroll taxes and other benefit categories from the first quarter were the
cause for the reduced personnel cost. While the sale leaseback lease expense offset in part by reduced
depreciation cost was the primary contributor to the increased occupancy cost. Additionally, we reduced our
anticipated annual cash incentive payout from 70% to approximately 67% of target awards at the end of the
second quarter, so not much change quarter-over-quarter with respect to our outlook for incentive cost for either
cash or equity incentives.
Again, the reduced incentive accrual speaks to the variable cost nature of our incentives, which are all
substantially performance-based. Additionally, along with deferring projects or slowing our hiring, we feel like we

have enough levers to throttle back on expenses should we need to. We have again lowered our expense growth
forecast for this year and have incorporated that into our updated outlook. As it stands, our expense guidance
was previously low to mid-teens growth for 2023. We have lowered to high single digits to low teens growth for
2023 over 2022.
Our tangible book value per common share increased to $48.85 at quarter end up 16%. Influence of this increase
was the sale-leaseback transaction, which provided almost $86 million in pre-tax gains, offset in part by $10
million in securities losses. In view of the macro environment, we anticipate retaining this incremental capital at
least through the end of this year. We believe the actions we've taken to preserve tangible book value and our
tangible capital ratio have served us well and have no plans currently to alter our Tier 1 capital stack via any sort
of common or preferred offering.
The chart on the bottom left of the slide compares several capital ratios as of the end of March to our peers.
Although we don't anticipate significant changes to the capital rules, we are pleased with these results and our
ability to withstand any changes to the capital rules that potentially could come our way.
Now, a few comments about BHG before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. The top-right chart is
consistent with various calls and details that production has been consistent over the last several quarters at $1
billion to $1.2 billion per quarter. Placements to the bank network were less in the second quarter, while
placements to institutional investors were at the highest level ever and it signaled that demand for BHG paper by
some of the most respected asset managers in the country is really strong.
BHG has been able to penetrate a very liquid channel over the last few years, which during some of these times
has proven to be somewhat fickle for some of the BHG's competitors. Over the last several years, BHG has made
periodic calls to pivot between on-balance sheet investor paper and off-balance sheet bank placements.
Historically, as institutional investors come to the table, their orders may receive a level of priority as to funding,
which BHG has to manage. That said, BHG's unique bank network, which we believe can't be replicated by any
other BHG competitor, continues to grow and provide the necessary liquidity to BHG.
This is the new slide where we're trying to provide additional clarity with regard to the significant funding channels
available to BHG in replacement of their loan production. What's new to the funding channel list is that in the
second quarter, BHG successfully negotiated two private whole loan sales with $550 million of capacity. These
are slightly different and that in both cases, these were large purchases structured similar to the bank network.
Gain on sale treatment has afforded these sales as the investors acquired the loans with no recourse. BHG has
negotiated three warehouse loans with three well-known and respected asset managers private equity firms.
Performance of BHG's loans sold to the capital markets have been such that many of the firms that have
participated in the past are in constant contact to acquire more loans in the future.
The bank auction platform remains very liquid and able to meet the necessary funding that BHG requires of it. All
in, these funding channels collectively provide several billion dollars in capacity and the flexibility to manage
liquidity risk effectively between the various channels. This is the usual information we've shown in the past
detailing spread trends just in a slightly different format. The top chart represents the gain on sale of the off-
balance sheet bank network, and the bottom chart is a blended chart of all balance sheet funding strategies,
which incorporates the historical build-up of balances. As anticipated, spreads have come in with higher rates,
with the bank auction rates being consistent with pre-COVID spreads.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
During the second quarter, the blended spreads for on-balance sheet were slightly higher than the bank network
given the balance sheet loans reflect the build-up of balances over the last three years. And as it stands today,
BHG expects spreads to be fairly consistent going into the second half of 2023.
As we noted in the previous quarters, BHG has tightened its credit box over the last several quarters, particularly
with respect to the lower tranches of its borrowing base. This will have an impact on both production and spreads.
Average FICO scores in 2023 have increased to 743. As we've stated in prior quarters, BHG has been modifying
their credit models towards originating less risky assets. Production volumes remain strong even with tighter
credit underwriting. BHG refreshes its credit store monthly, always looking for indications of weakness in its
borrowing base. Credit scores are up from previous years. Additionally, approximately 22% of BHG's production is
with repeat borrowers, adding to the quality of their loan base.
This slide details reserves and losses for both off-balance sheet and on-balance sheet loans. As we mentioned in
previous quarters, BHG determined that loss rates in several lower tranches of their production was exceeding
internal tolerances and elected to stop lending into these lower tranches.
Their conclusion was that for loans written in 2021 and for most of 2022, several contained an element of rate
inflation, which required remediation. As a result, we believe outsized losses could occur over the next couple of
quarters at a similar pace as the last two quarters. Typically for BHG, approximately 70% of the loss content is
incurred within the first three years of origination, but with rate inflation, losses should come to light sooner.
As a result, BHG has expended significant resources to bulk up collection activities, including hiring more lawyers,
and will be instituting in-person closings for new borrowers, which was suspended during COVID. BHG had
another strong quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in originations and are on track to achieve to achieve $3.8
billion to $4 billion originations this year, which is slightly less than last year.
Thus far, through two quarters, productions is slightly more than the prior year, even with efforts to tighten the
credit box. BHG has a conservative bias that production in the last half of the year will likely be lower than the first
half, but should be close to what they had last year.
Net earnings are being forecasted at $175 million to $190 million which is a tighter forecast from last year – last
quarter's production of a 30% to 40% reduction from prior year's results. The numbers now work out to be a 35%
to 40% reduction.
Quickly again, the usual slide detailing our current financial outlook for 2023. We continue to plan for a recession,
but how severe it will be, neither we nor anyone else really knows. Our job is to manage the risk that face this
franchise every day. What we know is that our business model is relationship based, nimble and resilient. Our
management team has significant experience and have tackled economic downturns before. We have great
confidence that we'll be able to manage the high quality banking franchise that our shareholders have come to
expect from us and can currently handle whatever curveballs get thrown out. And with that, I'll turn it back over to
Terry.

Thanks, Harold. I mentioned at the outset that I would come back and offer my thoughts on the shares. Obviously,
the primary goal of the call is to have an in-depth review of quarterly performance, which we've now completed.
But beyond that, we work hard to make sure that investors have an opportunity to understand more than just what
went up and what went down during the quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
But to get to a better understanding of our approach for producing long-term shareholder value, aka total
shareholder returns or TSR. So perhaps the best place to begin is just examine what kind of total shareholder
return we've produced historically.
As you can see here over the last decade, PNFP has produced the single best total shareholder return among
peers. And I invite you if you get a chance to go back and look at it since our inception in 2000, look at it over our
first decade, look at it over our second decade. Over the last 15 years, over the last 20 years, I think you'd find us
at or near the top in all of those time segments, absolutely consistent performance, irrespective of the various
economic rate cycles over the last 23 years.
And so, what I won't examine now is how that happened. The analyses of a number of banks stock experts, and I
suspect that yours would show that there are three primary metrics that are highly correlated to TSR over time
and they're revenue growth, reported EPS growth, and tangible book value accretion. I suppose that there are an
infinite number of metrics that bear little or no correlation with TSR over time, but they include metrics like net
interest margin, percentage, cost of funds, deposit cost betas, loan yields, non-interest-bearing deposits, total
deposits, operating leverage and efficiency ratios just to name a few.
In fact, you've already seen our track record of total shareholder returns over the last decade. Yet I'm confident
that our NIM percentage has rarely, if ever, been above median. Our cost of funds has likely never been better
than median. Our deposit beta is always high both when rates go up and when they come down, loan yields have
generally been no better than median and our non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits ratio has generally
been less than most of our peers. There's nothing wrong with any of those metrics. In fact, we measure and study
all of them. It'd be hard to build a model without many of those inputs, but I'm just making the point that we focus
much more on growing revenues, growing EPS and accreting tangible book value than we do standard model
inputs like the NIM percentage or the cost beta or the percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total
deposits, because historically revenue growth, EPS growth and tangible book value accretion have been more
highly correlated with TSRs, which honestly is the main thing I care about.
When I say we focus much more tightly on growing revenues, growing EPS and creating tangible book value,
here's what I mean. Most of you know, a 100% of our salaried associates participate in our annual cash incentive
pool, 100%. No annual cash incentive is paid to virtually any salaried associate in this firm if our classified asset
ratio exceeds a certain level. But assuming we had made a bunch of bad loans, the metrics that determine
virtually every salaried associates pay out including mine is the revenue growth and the EPS growth rate.
Since revenue growth and EPS growth have been highly correlated with TSR. We have literally focused every
single salaried associate in this firm on those two variables, and I believe that's one of the critical reasons our firm
continues to compound revenue and earnings growth like few other can.
My personal incentive along with every other salaried associated in this firm depends on those two growth rates.
In terms of long term equity incentive plan, 100% of our associates are granted shares.
For most associates, those shares are time vested. But for the leadership team, the top 150 or so leaders in this
firm, including me, the substantial majority of our recurring annual award vesting is performance based and the
two primary managements are peer relative tangible book value accretion and peer relative ROATCE. In other
words, for the leadership of this firm to maximize the vesting of the restricted share grants from our long term
incentive plan, beyond clearing an asset quality threshold, which in this case is an NPA ratio, we have to outrun
75% of the banks in our peer group in terms of the tangible book value accretion and ROATCE.

Parenthetically, that might give you a little insight on why despite the extraordinary liquidity that we and virtually
every other bank had on our balance sheet following the pandemic, leadership of this firm did not close the bond
book with – when yields were at near all-time lows. So here's how that plays out. Within the last five calendar
years, we've seen a COVID pandemic quantitative easing, a mammoth influx of liquidity from all the government
stimulus in response to the pandemic, inflation or CPI as high as 9%. The most precipitous increase in Fed funds
raised in recent history, in addition to quantitative tightening and a dramatic increase – excuse me, a dramatic
decrease in money supply and associated deposits, and inverted yield curve, and a number of failures at
otherwise high flying banks. And through all that, on the upper right, you can see the dramatic outperformance of
our five-year EPS growth versus peers.
On the lower left, you can see that the primary driver of that EPS growth was the dramatic growth in revenue per
share, regardless of all the macroeconomic volatility. And then on the lower side, you see the very dramatic
compounding and tangible book value. So I believe that continued compounding of revenue, EPS and tangible
book value has been the primary contributor to producing the peer leading total shareholder return you saw
several slides back.
So, now, when you begin to think about what the TSR chart is going to look like over the next five years or over
the next 10 years or over the next 20 years, you might begin here, the southeastern markets we serve we have a
dramatically different growth profile than the rest of the nation, which has the potential to turbocharge our revenue
and EPS growth. I'd hate to think I had the compound earnings and revenue at the pace we intend to in some of
the other regions in this country.
But even more important than the dynamic growth that the markets we serve are likely to enjoy is the competitive
advantage that we've built. We're a market share taker. We've been one of the fastest growing banks over the last
23 years, and certain vibrant markets have certainly been a tailwind. But you can be sure the substantially more
important contributor to our growth has been our ability to take market share from vulnerable competitors.
What you're looking at here is market data produced by Greenwich Associates, the foremost provider of research
to US banks on the commercial market segment. This is from their client satisfaction dashboard, down the left
side of the chart, you see critical satisfaction variables based on their research, things like ease of doing
business, being trustworthy, valuing long term relationships, creative insights, the digital experience, the quality of
the relationship manager, cash management capabilities and so forth.
As you can see by the scale at the bottom, elements that are colored dark green are market leading, elements
that are colored red would be trailing or at the bottom of the market. And the elements colored all the various
shades from lighter green, to yellow to orange are all scores in between the best and the worst. So in the three
rightmost columns, you see Pinnacle scores for all these important satisfaction metrics for small businesses, as
company's sales from $1 million to $10 million. Middle market businesses, $10 million to $500 million in sales
segment. And then on the far right, the combined score for the $100 million to $500 million in sales segment
throughout our multi-state footprint.
You know, I've studied the chart very long to see that Pinnacle's market leader for virtually every single one of
these metrics, and this is critically important to understand, these charts cover our entire footprint and compare
the five or six market share leaders in addition to Pinnacle, including Truist, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC,
First Citizens and First Horizon. I obviously don't know if Greenwich could identify any other banks that dominate
their markets overwhelmingly as we do. But I'd be surprised across our footprint, we're far and away the market
leader in terms of overall client satisfaction and the all-important Net Promoter Score.

It seems to me the most important score of all is the Net Promoter Score. Most of you know it's a comparison of
the number of clients that are so engaged with your brand that they fully intend to advocate for you with their
friends and colleagues less the clients that are so disengaged with your brand that they're detracting from your
reputation in the community. And you can see here our Net Promoter Score is the league leading 86 among small
businesses, companies with sales from $1 million to $10 million and a leading 82 in the middle market, companies
with sales from $10 million to $500 million.
Connecting this slide with the last, regardless of all the money spent by our largest regional national competitors
on technology and on the digital experience, our clients rate our digital experience more highly than their clients
rate theirs throughout our footprint. So much has been said about a potential migration regional bank clients to the
national providers. When you look at these scores, it should be apparent why we lost virtually no large clients
following the Silicon Valley failure and why we continue to grow deposits at a dramatic pace in the aftermath.
Look at the dramatic difference in Net Promoter Scores between us at the top and our large national competitors
at the bottom. It'd be very hard to leave a bank you absolutely love, and honestly, it's not hard to leave a bank you
hate. Some banks compete on price. Some just wait for a yield curve that suits your balance sheet. But for us, it's
this relentless pursuit of creating raving fans that explains our ability to grow revenue and EPS almost regardless
of the economic ups and downs.
So not surprisingly, when Greenwich probed businesses in our footprint about which banks are likely to earn a
share of their business over the next 12 months, Pinnacle is far and away the most frequent response. As you
can see at year-end, 42% of small business respondents named Pinnacle, and 50% of middle market business
respondents named Pinnacle as the bank most likely to receive a share of their business. That's an incredibly
strong momentum. And when Greenwich probed clients regarding which banks are most at risk for losing a share
of their business, Pinnacle was far and away the least frequently mentioned response.
Consequently, our net momentum of our businesses in our markets is market leading at 38 and 42 in two
segments. His further substantiation of the point I've been making about our relative lack of vulnerability versus
the large national banks in our markets. The thesis that regional banks are more vulnerable to the large national
banks might be true for undifferentiated banks, but business clients in these segments within our footprint might
suggest otherwise. Given our net business momentum scores.
So really, to sum it up. What I'm trying to say is it's our belief that revenue growth, EPS growth and tangible book
value accretion have historically been most highly correlated with TSR. That's why we focus our entire firm on it
through our short term and long term incentives. We believe our relationship based model has historically
produced strong TSR with more manageable risks than many.
The proof's in the pudding, when you think about the fact that the markets that we serve are likely to outperform
the nation and the fact that we've got a demonstrably differentiated, high touch and tech model that generally
attracts more [indiscernible] (00:32:35) less clients. That's the key to compounding earnings over time,
irrespective of economic volatility.
We'll stop there, operator and take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] . And the first
question today is coming from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Jared, your line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions, I guess. You know, the deposit growth is great seeing that we've seen some
deposit growth in some of your peers today as well. Where is that coming from? Is that really just the biggest
national players or are you taking more wallet share from your existing customers, I guess maybe just a little more
detail on where that money is coming from and how much more runway you think there is to take that market
share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Jared. That's a great question. I'll give you several things to think about. One is we've got a lot of people
we've hired over the last couple of years that are still out there bringing their clients to our firm. I think also that
when you get into this time of the year, we start seeing seasonality play into our deposit book. And so,
consequently, we fully anticipate that we'll see swell here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then,
lastly, our public funds, we've won, call it, a handful of public fund clients here over the last quarter or so, and
they're also building their balances in a more outsized way and in a more [indiscernible] (00:34:43) that way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jared, I might add to Harold's comments. I think, in terms of getting to where it comes from, I think his first point is
important. The folks that we have hired, the largest contributor of revenue producers to us has been Truist. The
second largest has been Wells Fargo. And so, they are about consolidating relationships here based on their
ability to serve clients better and so forth.
So, anyway, I think that's a big part of it. But I wouldn't want it to be unsaid that, I think, if you were to come inside
this firm and talk to people, you would hear them say, hey, what – we're about to transition this firm from being
one of the best asset generators to being one of the best deposit generators. And so, there's a lot of energy inside
the firm on a number of different specialties that we've built. I've mentioned them in the past, deposit verticals that
attack large pools of money, where we have some value-added product offering for things like property managers,
homeowners associations, a variety of pools of money like that, where we've got a value-added product that
we've introduced over the last couple of years.

So, those things have really good momentum and there are a number of other of those verticals that are being
rolled out literally as we speak. So, again, my hope and belief is you'll see a little bit of a transition in our ability to
gather beyond just the relationship approach that we – that Harold and I both commented on, but also through
those specialties.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's great color. Thanks. And then, looking at the pace of hiring, you've done a great job hiring people in market
expansion. How should we be thinking about your pace of hiring new revenue producers at this point? And can
you give an update on maybe some of the expansion markets that you've recently targeted?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I just, I guess maybe start with the second part of it, comment on the expansion markets that we're in. I
think, we've already given indications for the Atlanta market that I think their commitments are about $1.6 billion,
north of a $1 billion in loan outstandings. The more recent large market DC, I believe that they have generally
been a net provider of funding, if you can believe that, and generally in pretty short order approaching $700
million in funding, I think maybe about $650 million in loan outstandings. Commitments are well above that and
the momentum is really strong in both those markets.
I think if you were to talk to Rob Garcia or Carolyne Pelton that lead our effort in those markets, they would say
they're enjoying great success, both recruiting people and recruiting clients in large measure based on the
strength of our treasury management capabilities and so forth. So, at any rate, we continue to be excited about
those expansions.
I think in terms of hiring people, we continue to recruit. I think we continue to do well. My guess is we might not
hire quite as many people this year as we did last year, but we'll hire a lot. There's still a lot of hiring momentum,
and I always try to hold out as a possibility that it's conceivable to me, we might find our way to a market
extension or two in the event we feel like we've got a team that could build us a big bank. You've heard us talk
about that in the past. We're not just hiring anybody and we're not trying to build an LPO, but if we had the
opportunity to build a big bank, we would – we'd proceed with that. And so, anyway, I hope I'm responding to your
question there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, that's great. That's great. And then, just finally for me, maybe for Harold, how should we be thinking about
or where cash balances go in the near term? And then, I guess, from what you said, we should just assume that
any reduction in cash either goes directly to loan growth or just FHLB reduction, any target...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. It's probably going to be around broker deposits. We've got about, call it, upwards of $2 billion
that we think that we can use to kind of – to help fund loan growth here in the – over the year and also help
reduce the size of our wholesale book.

line is live.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Stephen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I guess one of the things I'm curious about is just the strength of the deposit base. And you've spoken a lot about
how you incent your people and noted that you feel like this has really been a shift. But I'm guessing – I guess I'm
asking how has this shift really occurred? Have you had to change your incentives to drive that kind of culture
shift towards deposits or is it really continuing to focus on revenue growth and telling these people, if you want to
book your loans, you got to book the deposit first? How can we think about that cultural migration, I guess, that's
occurred?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Stephen, that's a great question and I appreciate it because it's important to me. We've not changed our
incentive at all and as you know, I'm a believer. I'm hoping I'm going to convince you to be a believer that when
you get all the associates of this firm aimed at revenue growth and EPS growth, it's not hard to illustrate at all.
Guys, we've got to buy more money or we can't book our loans. Guys, we've got to buy more money at a lower
price. It is so easy to move our company to whatever really is important in order to grow the revenues and EPS. I
think it would shock you how easy it is to illustrate how that works. I think in the last quarterly all-associate
meeting, we just put a slide up there and show what the financial performance is.
And you show them, okay, look, I think we're all on our margin here and it's largely a function of cost of funds. And
so, then you go down and show on the expenses we're right on track, but don't miss, the reason we're on track is
because we reduced our incentive accrual. And so, guys, to be clear, what just happened here in this quarter is
we took money out of mine in your pocket and our incentive accrual and we put it in our client's pocket in terms of
the rate we paid them on deposits.

And so, again, we have not altered the incentive. I doubt that we're going to. It is how we're able to move people
back and forth, not that we're constrained by it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's very helpful. Thanks, Terry. And then I guess in terms of the margin outlook, I think Harold, you guys give
the cost of deposit at June 30. I'm not sure if you gave like a June or end of period kind of margin relative to
where the margin was for the quarter as a whole.
But how do you think about incremental progression and compression from here? And can you speak to the
amount of floors you might have in the loan book if and when we get rates lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We've got loans – we've got floors on loans. And we're pulling – we're pushing for floors on loans. We're
also pushing for – folks to be very cautious about what rates they're paying on their deposits. I think we can be
more deliberate with respect to our deposit rates as we go into the second half of the year, as to margin
performance in the third and fourth quarter it's going to be down in all likelihood.
We think there's one more rate increase coming to us that we'll have to support in some way with our depositors.
But that said, don't miss. We think our net interest income is likely to be flat up. So as Terry said, we're going to
be focused on the revenue line and we're going to try to make sure that we don't sacrifice any of the ground that
we've gained here over the last, call it two or three quarters with respect to some of these clients that we've
gathered. So I'll stop there, Stephen, and see if I have gotten to your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. And I think that makes a lot of sense. I think it speaks to that slide you guys had in maybe a year ago
where you showed your deposit betas, but your NII outperformance irrespective of those deposit betas, I think
that's a good point. Maybe just lastly for me around the new hires, you had some particular strength in wealth
management. Can you give us a view on where kind of those new hires have been concentrated and I guess
have more of them been into that wealth management platform over time, is that driven some of the strength
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, there's no doubt that we have hired a good number of people in the wealth management segment, and it's
really across the wealth management segment. When I say that, I mean a lot of hiring in trust, which believe it or
not, it's a double-digit growth business for us as well as hiring in brokerage, as well as hiring what some might
refer to as private bankers, they are relationship managers that are focused on wealthy individual.
So, we've had hiring across all those segments. I think that we probably have had a little more hiring in the wealth
management segment over the last year or so, year or two than is normal. But I don't think that's necessarily by
design. I think it is more availability of people. And so, again, we just had – as you know, what we do is try to aim
at high producers that are frustrated in the organizations that they work for. So I think there's sort of been elevated
frustration there, which has fueled our ability to hire people. I wouldn't look for that to be the ongoing norm at all, I

would say, I wouldn't expect much different about the hiring mix in 2024 as an example than I would have
expected in 2022.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start, so you had favorable commentary in terms of the outflows of noninterest-bearing starting to abate
and then even the pace of deposit increase starting to abate. You also cited, Harold, I think you said the
competitive environment is unpredictable. Is that a function of the competition lessening that you saw? Are you
starting to see that abate a bit? Maybe you could drill down a little bit into what gives you a comfort here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's primarily around the trends when we watch our deposit book of about every day over the last, call
it 90 days, 120 days. It feels like the pace is slower. It feels like the calls coming into our units is less anxious. It's,
there's a lot more opportunity coming from some of the new hires that we've had around deposit gathering, those
sort of things. Terry and I were talking about price-based competitors before we start this – before we started the
call today. What I believe is priced-based competitors generally, that's a short-term phenomenon.
Eventually, they have to go back to whatever's necessary to create the profit margins they need to have. And we
feel like that a lot of this recent activity from some of these regional competitors will have to be short lived. I don't
think that they can be competitive at the rates they're offering. And so consequently and hopefully that competitive
kind of environment we've been in will also abate to some extent. I can be completely wrong on that, but I think
history is that price competitors can't be price competitors for a long period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah. That's helpful, Harold. On the expenses, I appreciate taking down the expense guidance and outlook
a bit, but where we stand today? What's your bias in terms of where you think right now? I know there's a lot of
variables. Where you'll likely end up in this high-single-digit to low teens percent increase range?

On expenses?

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think if you were to just kind of twist my arm and put it behind my back and make me really be in pain, I'd
have to go probably to a call it 9 to 11, somewhere in that neighborhood.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then final question from me. In terms of the sale-leaseback, Harold, could you
walk us through the P&L impact on a go-forward basis from the transaction? Just want to make sure...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Just from 30,000 feet, my lease expense less the depreciation savings from selling those properties is
probably over a 12-month period about, call it a $14 million kind of additional rate – run rate increase. But the
cash that we're able to generate from moving the $200 million in fixed assets from 0% to now call it 5.25%. And
the cash we generated from taking investment securities, $174 million of those from call it 2% to 2.5% to now
5.5%. That increase in yield basically offsets all of the depreciate – I mean, all the lease expense increase.
And just to be completely candid around the sale-leaseback, when we started looking at this back in the fourth
quarter of last year. The kind of the play was that we would reposition more of the Bond book. And consequently
we thought we could probably reposition as much as another call it $700 million or $800 million in bonds with the
gain we got on the sale leaseback.
But with all the activity in the first quarter and now going into the second quarter and whether or not there's going
to be a recession or not, we elected just to warehouse the capital that we created from the gain.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it, so the benefit is you create excess capital from an overall earnings view, it's fairly neutral moving forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's exactly the point. And that's basically why we did the sale of the investment securities is to neutralize the
impact of the lease expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Hey, good morning, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, I wanted to get updated assumptions on deposit mix, including you guide. I know Harold, you mentioned
previously that, by year-end we could get to below 20%. So I wanted to see if you still feel comfortable with that
sort of trajectory, just given where things stand today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we still feel like that that's a reasonable kind of number to put on the board, I don't think we or
anybody else, Brandon, has any idea where non-interest-bearing deposits are going to go here in this
environment, but it does seem like things are feeling better about that and that we're at the end of the day, the two
things have to be in play.
One is our clients have to get to a level of operating cash where they feel like I need this in an operating cash
account. And on our side, our salesforce, our people, our treasury management people have to talk to our clients
about this seems to be a real – a reasonable amount for you to keep in this deposit account that you need to
manage your business. And so, I think those conversations are occurring every day. And I think it just leans into
this relationship-based model that we continue to kind of hold on to as while we think this whole non-interest-
bearing reduction is feeling better for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. Makes sense. And then I wanted to talk about the allowance increase in the quarter, and I
understand the increase in commercial real estate, but I saw that consumer real estate had a pretty sizable jump
as well. So just want to see if there's any context around that increase?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the increase in the consumer real estate allocation is primarily related to the macro case and the
duration of those assets. So, we're not going to argue about whether or not we're a big fan of CECL or not. But at
the end of the day, when rates go up and those assets extend out, then the CECL model automatically penalizes
those loans and the decisions you made on those loans back several years ago. Does that make sense to you,
Brandon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q

Yeah, yeah. So, nothing kind of qualitative there, just purely quantitative?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. I want to circle back to the margin and extend just your thoughts into next year. And it's helpful to think
about or you've given guidance that you think NII is still flat to up in the back half of the year. But as we think
about 2024 and let's just say we get a hike in July and then we're at that level of Fed funds, so we don't get rate
cuts. As we move into next year, how do you think about how your NII might look next year in kind of a higher for
a longer scenario?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think a one big factor in that assumption would be what does the intermediate long end of the curve
do? As you know, no banker is a fan of an inverted curve. And so it just going to – it's going to require a lot more
work on our part, in front of our salesforce and how we price with clients and all that sort of stuff. So, so far, we
don't think credit is going to be up. We don't see that moving going into 2024. We think we're well-positioned
there. But as far as our ability to grow net interest income in kind of a mid-teens level, it would be very hard as we
look at 2024. But it all depends on what we believe is going to happen at the intermediate long end of the curve.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And so – and as you get to a point where you think NII growth might pull back to maybe the low teen maybe on a
high-single-digit kind of pace in that scenario, how quickly do you think you'll reconsider the expense growth going
into next year to be at a lower pace, kind of like what we saw this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. We'll have to – we'll have to consider a lot of things going into the expense book
next year. One would be, replenishment of our incentive cost, whatever that ends up being for 2023. And going
back to trying to figure out how to achieve a full incentive again next year. And then, where we are with respect to
hiring we're today.
We're – today we are call it very conservative on our – what we would call our support level positions where we're
not as far as revenue producers, we still are out there actively looking for revenue producers. We've asked our
support units to kind of hold it in and do what they need to do in order to meet whatever objectives they have
internally but not to [indiscernible] (00:55:54) on their hiring.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, that's great. That's very helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up on credit. It seems like the
guidance feels like loan growth should still be strong but slow a little bit in the back half of the year relative to the
first half. And it didn't feel like you expect a big increase in the reserve ratio, maybe just a modest and so is it fair
to assume outside of some unexpected change in what you're seeing on the credit front, that the absolute dollar
number of the provision expense should be lower in the back half of the year relative to the $30-some million
number we saw this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

Yes. Yeah. We don't anticipate provision being that in the second half as it was in the second quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Olney from Stephens. Matt, your line of live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. I want to make sure I understand the strategy on liquidity. It sounds like the excess liquidity amount,
as you view this, is around $2 billion. And you want to be patient, deploying this could take up to a year. Did I get
that right? And then, I guess, kind of part two, the broker deposits that could be paid down that you mentioned,
Harold, any more color on these products? Are these CDs and when do they start to roll? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. They will roll off over the, call it, the next six months. I've got some public fund money that I think we'll also
be paying off over the next six months. So, it'll be those kind of things. I don't think it'll take a year. I think it's more
like probably six to seven, eight months. Matt, if I remember, my maturity schedule is kind of where we're looking
at on this liquidity number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, kind of part two of that and thinking about the interest rate sensitivity on
that, I think it's on slide 49 of your deck there. Where do you see that migrating over the next year, especially as
we get closer to any kind of Fed funds cut? I would assume, as you to put out liquidity, the bank would become
more rate neutral. But just curious kind of how you see that moving over the next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I think you're exactly right on that. I think once we get to a terminal value on Fed funds, I think our sensitivity
will get – kind of go back to historical norms. There will likely be deposit creep, but it won't be in leaps and
bounds. It'll be in small numbers. But we'll also have the advantage of repricing fixed rate loans going into kind of
a – kind of on stabilized rate environment if there is such a thing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly on the loan growth front, you've talked about managing the
growth, lower in recent months, and being more selective and very careful. I'm also surprised that you didn't take
down a loan growth guidance this quarter. It looks like the full-year guidance implies will be flattish from what we
saw in 2Q. Can you just kind of speak to the pipelines as far as what you're seeing today and currently versus a
few months ago?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, I think you know our approach well. So, much of the loan growth is generated by the consolidation of
banking relationships by new hires. And that phenomenon occurs sort of irrespective of whatever other economic
factors exist. And some people say, well, why don't you just take it to zero? Well, that's no good for anybody. I
mean, you know we hire people. They have clients. They need to move them or otherwise they won't be their
clients anymore. And so, at any rate, that fuels some of the growth.
What we do, I think, to Harold's point is we use pricing, which curves things on the margin. We've said as an
asset class constructions, asset class, we want less obvious things like HLTs and those kinds of things. And so,
they're marginal changes that are really what tamp down the growth. But in terms of what the economic loan
demand looks like, I would say that that is having an impact. I do believe that pure economic loan request that we
see today would be easily less than what they would have been a quarter or two ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Both CRE and C&I, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. That's helpful, Terry. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brody Preston from UBS. Brody, your line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask just if I could start on the fixed rate
portion of the loan portfolio. I just want to ask if you knew what the dollar amount of fixed rate loans that were
repricing over the next 12 months were, and then when I kind of go back to your previous decks, it looks like fixed
rate origination yields were about 4.75% to 5% about four, four-and-a-half years ago. Is that a good yield to use
when we think about what's rolling off the book for fixed rate loans right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Brody, I don't have what the fixed rate maturities in the C&I book are with me. I just got what's in the
commercial real estate and construction book on the slide. But I wouldn't imagine that the yield difference would
be terribly different between what's in the commercial real estate versus the C&I book. I just don't know what the

volume would be with respect to that. Most of my C&I book is floating or variable. And so, I mean, it would be
slightly higher, but I don't know how much more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. So, I can just use that CRE portion as a proxy. Also on that, just on the negotiated deposit book, I
wanted to ask just what portion of that book has recently renegotiated on rate. And for those that have recently
renegotiated, where are the new rates moving to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that number would be in the mid-3s, somewhere in that range. And I would imagine a substantial
amount of that book has been renegotiated. I've not seen a bell curve of my deposit book lately, where you track
like what the rate is, the low rates versus the high rates and all that. But substantially, all of those deposits have
repriced in one way, shape or form.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. And on the sale leaseback transaction, do you happen to know what the cap rate was on that
transaction for the buyer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I really don't. That would be an interesting thing to know, but I don't.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, you did have $100 million or just under $100 million of fixed rate CRE and construction
loans that were maturing in the second quarter, at least for the slide deck last time. I wanted to ask just what
happened to those loans. Did they re-up with you at your targeted rate? Did any of them leave the bank? And I
guess did any of them struggle with the increase in rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'll go back and look at my numbers. But I think there was only a small percentage that left the bank. I think
probably a third maybe, 25% to a third left the bank and went to the [indiscernible] (01:04:09) market. I think the
rest are probably still hanging with us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just a couple last ones. On the AFS portfolio, do you happen to know what the effective duration
of that portfolio is and what the conditional prepayment rate you're assuming in that duration calculation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think the average life of AFS book, if you're talking about years, is that right?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Or you're talking about percentage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think the life in the AFS book now is somewhere around eight and the percentage duration, I think, is around 5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Do you know what the CPR is in that duration calculation, Harold?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't. But I can get that for you, Brody, and I'll get it to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. I appreciate it. And then just last one, just I think you might have touched on it earlier, but I'm sorry if I
misheard you. Just the increase in the CRE reserve, was there anything like, was there any specific kind of metric
that drove that increase within your CECL model just because it had been declining for the last several quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I can't point to any kind of – anything specific in the CRE book. There's no individual loans in there that
contributed to it or anything like that. I don't know of anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I was more interested in, Harold, within the ACL modeling, if there was any specific variable where maybe there
was a larger price decline that you were factoring in within the ACL modeling, I just that's what I was more getting
at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, really I don't know the answer to that question, if there was one, I don't think there is one.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brian Martin from Janney Montgomery. Brian, your line
is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Hey, guys. Most of my stuff was just asked in the last couple of questions. But just one thing, Harold, you gave a
spot rate on, I think, deposits. Just do you have what the spot rate was on the margin at the end of the quarter or
just or it just sounds as though it's going to go, you talked about the dollars of net interest income because the
margin itself is going to drop the next couple of quarters, maybe stabilize later in the year. Is that based on kind of
your outlook on rates today, is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's fair. I don't have my monthly financial information in front of me. But we think it's going to, the margin
will decline over the next couple of quarters. But again, our focus is on that net interest income number that we
think is flat to up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yep. Got you. Okay. And then liquidity normalizes by end of year. That's kind of what you're suggesting, that's six,
or seven months or so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we'll be close by the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Okay. All right. And then just last to – just on BHG, just kind of the outlook narrowed a little bit more just as we
think about 2024, any high level, how we should be thinking about BHG next year, Harold with depending on how
these losses potentially play out or I don't know if CECL is in there...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I would not, first of all, we're not giving guidance on 2024, but at the same time, I think BHG's outsized
growth rates from over the last several years. And, depending on which one you look at, I think they'll become a
lot more normalized going into 2024.

line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the BHG. You know, you called out the loan sales to the institutional
investors, were those also covered under a substitution agreement, or when you say there's no recourse, that's
just truly no recourse, they're off the balance sheet and any losses will be absorbed by those borrowers or
purchasers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right. That's right. From my understanding is, they bought those loans and they're theirs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
The gain on those wasn't quite at the same level. But at the same time, they don't have the recourse.

Okay. Great. Thank you.
