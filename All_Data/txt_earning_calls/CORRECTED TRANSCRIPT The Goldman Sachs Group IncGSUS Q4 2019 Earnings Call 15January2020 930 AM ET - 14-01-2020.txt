David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Heather, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm happy to be here with you. Let me begin
on page 1.
In the fourth quarter, net revenues were $10 billion, up 23% versus a year ago, marking our highest fourth quarter
since 2007. Net earnings were $1.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $4.69 and an ROE of 8.7%. I would
note that we took a $1.1 billion litigation charge during the quarter, which burdened EPS and ROE by $2.95 and
5.3%, respectively. Overall, our business performed well and against an improved market environment relative to
the challenging backdrop experienced a year ago. For the 2019 full year, we generated firm-wide net revenues of
$36.5 billion, nearly matching last year which was our highest year in 8 years. We reported a return on equity of
10% and a return on tangible equity of 10.6%. Litigation impact to ROE and ROTE was approximately 150 basis
points for the year.
We had a number of accomplishments in 2019. Our incumbent businesses across the firm performed well, and
our new business initiatives progressed as planned as we navigated a dynamic operating environment over the
course of the year. On the revenue side, our Global Markets business produced stronger results in an
environment that improved over the year driven by strong leadership and a clear focus on client service. We
generated solid growth in FICC driven by strength across our franchise including rates, commodities and
mortgages. We grew firm-wide assets under supervision to record levels. We also delivered strong equity
investment performance, which is an important precursor to our alternatives platform expansion plans.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
In Investment Banking, our performance was solid in the context of lower industry deal volumes. We held a
commanding lead in our M&A business and maintained our number one position in equity underwriting. While our
operating expenses grew as a function of litigation and investments in our businesses, we actively controlled our
costs across both compensation and non-compensation, providing capacity to fund our growth. From this position
of strength, we achieved important milestones in 2019 across our key growth opportunities.
We continue to institutionalize our One Goldman Sachs operating philosophy, keeping clients at the center of
everything we do. We launched the firm's first ever credit card platform in partnership with Apple and generated
over $850 million in net revenues across our broader Consumer Banking business. We completed the initial build
of our Digital Transaction Banking platform and processed over $2 trillion of payments on behalf of the firm. Our
platform rollout to third party clients remains planned for the first half of this year.
We acquired United Capital, bolstering our capabilities to provide a full spectrum of wealth management services
to individuals. We realigned our Investing businesses into a cohesive unit to support our alternatives growth
platform. We enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of the firm by integrating major portions of our operations
and engineering's teams into our businesses, and we strengthened our engineering capabilities with strategic
hires of a new Chief Technology Officer and a co-Chief Information Officer and added talent across the firm.
Importantly, we made significant investments to expand our client franchise, grow and diversify our revenues, and
operate more efficiently. Including these investments, our overall performance was solid even though our
investments reduced our returns in 2019. We are confident that they are improving the long-term profitability of
Goldman Sachs.
Turning to the operating environment on page 2. In the fourth quarter, we had solid engagement with our
institutional clients and strong growth with our individual clients. Notwithstanding, corporate client sentiment
remained more measured. During the quarter, we saw steadily rising asset prices, improvement in the secured
funding markets as the Federal Reserve took steps to bring stability throughout the quarter and particularly over
year-end. We also saw progress to a Brexit resolution following the UK general election and improvements in the
US-China trade tensions, including the phase one agreement. These conditions contributed to a support of
market-making backdrop relative to a year ago. Looking forward, our economists continue to expect global GDP
growth in excess of 3% over the next two years.
In the US, the fourth quarter provided a backdrop of solid growth, evidenced by a steepening yield curve and
continued strong consumer sentiment. Conditions remain supported by the Federal Reserve's three mid-cycle
rate cuts in 2019. Going forward, we expect US growth to continue to run at about 2% given robust labor markets,
low inflation and strong wage growth.
In Europe, growth continues to remain relatively low given manufacturing weakness. However, in China, trade
headwinds appear to have moderated with both monetary and fiscal stimulus supporting growth estimates of
nearly 6%. While we continue to monitor economic data and emerging geopolitical risks including escalating US-
Iran tensions, based on what we see today, we remain optimistic that the current constructive environment for
economic growth can continue.
Next, I would like to take a moment to discuss the situation with 1MDB. As we mentioned last quarter, we are in
ongoing discussions relating to a potential settlement of issues related to 1MDB with the relevant authorities
across multiple jurisdictions, including most notably the US and Malaysia. Given the nature of these negotiations,
we determined the need to take a litigation charge in the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier, our legal provision in
the quarter was $1.1 billion with the preponderance related to 1MDB. While there can be no assurance of

reaching a settlement, or the timing if we do, our conversations with authorities are progressing and remain
active. We are working hard to bring closure to this matter as quickly as possible.
As I've said in the past, we do not believe this matter is representative of our long-standing values. Over the past
several years, we have taken the time to be self-critical and reflective to ensure that our culture of integrity,
collaboration and escalation only improves from this experience. These efforts will continue.
Lastly, before passing it over to Stephen, I would like to briefly address our upcoming Investor Day which will be
held on Wednesday, January 29. Through a series of presentations from John, Stephen, and me, and our
business and control side leadership, we hope to provide our stakeholders additional insight into the firm's
strategic direction. We will provide a detailed review of our strategic priorities by business, including new products
and services that we have highlighted to you previously. We will also provide financial targets and goals by which
our progress can be measured. We hope you will join us for the day either in person or via webcast.
With that, I will turn it over to Stephen.

Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Let's turn to page 3. Before reviewing our financial results, I'd like to spend a moment
discussing our new financial disclosure.
On January 7, we announced a realignment of our segments which form the basis of our earnings presentation
today. We now report the following four businesses: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management,
and Consumer & Wealth Management. We believe our revised financial reporting reflects our ongoing
commitment to transparency. The segments more closely aligned to how we now manage the firm with clear lines
of management responsibility, and leadership over each segment. The segments importantly also reflect how we
serve our key clients, including corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals. And lastly, the segments
provide for greater accountability in the execution of our forward strategy as our initiatives are executed and
reported.
Importantly, I would note the key structural change to eliminate the Investing & Lending segment is consistent
with our business strategy and will allow you to track our lending and financing activities alongside the relevant
businesses, as well as to allow our progress in a more transparent way.
Also of note, and consistent with our broad commitment to transparency, we elected not to create a corporate
segment. This is a different approach than many of our peers who retained costs or capital at the corporate level.
We believe our process of allocating all firm-wide costs and capital is a prudent management tool and a more
comprehensive way of evaluating the true performance of our businesses.
Next, let me itemize several of the more significant elements of our segment changes, which we listed in our
recent 8-K filing. As I mentioned, the most significant change was the elimination of Investing & Lending. Now the
results of our lending and financing activities are included within each of the four segments.
For example, corporate lending activity is included in our Investment Banking segment. This encompasses
relationship lending, transaction-related financing, and broader lending to our corporate clients. Secured or
collateralized financing activity on behalf of institutional clients of our securities business is now reflected in FICC
and equities financing within our Global Markets segment. Lending related to our alternatives-investing
businesses, including investments in debt securities and real estate credit is reflected in the Asset Management

segment. And lending to our individual clients across all wealth bands is in the Consumer & Wealth Management
segment. Additionally, we now report the firm's on-balance sheet equity, credit and real estate investing activities
in our Asset Management segment. This segment houses both GSAM and our Merchant Banking activities for
Asset Management clients, supporting our third-party alternatives business expansion.
Consolidating our on-balance sheet and third-party Asset Management investing activities is consistent with our
forward strategy. To that end, this segment includes management and incentive fees associated with Asset
Management clients across the full spectrum of asset classes from cash to alternatives and will also include the
impact of quarterly valuation changes, the balance sheet positions held in public and private equity investments.
Another significant change is additional disclosure in our new Consumer & Wealth Management segment,
including wealth management fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending revenues, as well as Consumer
Banking revenues. This segment houses our long-standing Private Wealth business as well as our newer
consumer offerings. Broadly speaking, and as I noted earlier, the new segments align with the client orientation of
the firm. Investment Banking, Global Markets and Asset Management encompass the firm's engagement with
corporates, governments and institutions, and Consumer & Wealth Management includes our engagement with
individuals. With that as background, let me review the financial results of the firm on the basis of our new
segments.
Starting on page 4, Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12% versus the
third quarter, but down 6% versus a robust fourth quarter last year. For the full year, Investment Banking net
revenues were $7.6 billion, our second highest ever, down 7% from a record 2018 reflecting lower industry deal
volumes. Fourth quarter financial advisory revenues of $855 million were up 23% sequentially, but down 29%
versus last year, consistent with lower industry volumes.
In 2019, we participated in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions and closed 375 deals for nearly $1.3 trillion of
deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings. Looking forward, conditions for
continued M&A activity remain solid. Client dialogues are healthy, financing markets are open, and we are seeing
active interest across a variety of sectors. We also continue to see strength in our backlog coming into the New
Year, notwithstanding solid revenue bookings from deal closings in the fourth quarter.
Moving to underwriting. Equity underwriting net revenues of $378 million were up 3% versus the third quarter and
up 23% versus last year. For the year, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting, supported by $68
billion of deal volume across more than 375 transactions. During the quarter, where we saw particular strength in
our US and European equity businesses, we participated in leadership roles on several of the largest public
offerings.
Turning to debt underwriting. Net revenues were $599 million, up 14% versus the third quarter and up 37% from a
year ago, reflecting higher asset-backed and leverage finance activity. Our franchise remains well positioned, as
evidenced by our number two high yield league table ranking. Revenues from corporate lending were $232
million. These revenues relate to a net $28 billion funded portfolio of corporate loans, now held in Investment
Banking, as well as our portfolio of corporate lending commitments.
As background, there are three components to our corporate lending portfolio: relationship lending to our
corporate clients, credit extensions for strategic activity including acquisition financing, and lending to our
broadening footprint of corporate clients where we target attractive returns. Looking forward, given our active level
of strategic dialogue, our expanding client footprint, and strong corporate relationships, we remain optimistic

about the continued level of commercial engagement by our corporate clients aided by the current backdrop of
well-functioning and constructive capital markets.
Moving to Global Markets on page 5. Net revenues were $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up 33% versus last
year. Our growth was driven by a better market backdrop in FICC versus the end of last year and strong
performance in our equities businesses. For the full year, Global Markets generated $14.8 billion of net revenues,
up 2% versus 2018 driven by stronger FICC and higher equity financing performance.
In the fourth quarter, FICC net revenues were $1.8 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 63% year-over-year. Our
growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues where we saw better performance as
well as higher FICC financing revenues, notably in repo. Four out of five of our FICC market-making businesses
posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength of our client-
centric model and improved diversification of our business mix.
Our rates franchise in the US performed particularly well as we executed on behalf of our clients and navigated
the broader market environment effectively. In commodities, our business performed well across the board driven
by significantly stronger performance in oil, natural gas and power, and investor products. In mortgages, net
revenues rose, aided by strong client activity and performance in agency securities.
In currencies, net revenues improved versus last year amid a better geopolitical backdrop despite lower volatility.
We saw strong performance and activity around the general election in the UK and saw healthy corporate deal
contingent hedging activity in the quarter. Lastly, in credit, we saw better investment grade performance in the US
and EMEA, offset by lower client activity. As we have discussed previously, we are working to further improve
wallet share with each of our clients across both risk intermediation and financing while investing to expand our
capabilities to automate workflows, serve our clients electronically, and deliver structured solutions in efficient
formats.
Turning to equities on page 6. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, down 8% versus the third
quarter but up 12% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $979 million rose 9% versus a
year ago on stronger cash revenues in the US and Asia and strong performance in low-touch and block-trading,
partially offset by lower derivatives activity. Equities financing revenues of $732 million were up 17% year-over-
year, reflecting improved spreads and higher client balances. Financing activity remains a strategic priority for the
business, given it has historically exhibited attractive returns and considerable adjacent benefits to our broader
equities franchise, particularly for our growing systematic client base.
Moving to Asset Management on page 7. Collectively our Asset Management activities produced net revenues of
$3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 52% versus last year driven by stronger equity investment performance. For the
full year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $9 billion, in line with the strong 2018 as growth in equity
investment revenues offset lower incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees related to client
assets under supervision totaled $666 million, up 6% versus a year ago, offset by lower incentive fees. Across the
Asset Management segment, we managed AUS totaling $1.3 trillion at year-end, and we will cover firm-wide AUS
trends in a few moments.
Next, our equity investments generated record quarterly net revenues in the fourth quarter of $1.9 billion, up
significantly versus last year driven by gains on our public and private investments. Approximately 90% of the
gains were event-driven, including sales or marks on public securities as we took advantage of harvesting
opportunities.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
The fourth quarter showed material improvement relative to the third quarter where we experienced headwinds on
certain large equity positions, including Avantor, Tradeweb, WeWork, and Uber. During the fourth quarter, those
positions taken together rebounded and for the full year produced gains of approximately $400 million. In the
quarter, we also exited our position in Uber and reduced our position in Tradeweb. Our public portfolio was $2.4
billion at year-end. Where appropriate, we will continue to reduce the size of certain positions in the public
portfolio.
Net revenues from lending activities in Asset Management were $427 million and primarily relate to loans backed
by commercial and residential real estate. Lending revenues include net interest income and mark-to-market
gains on debt investments.
On page 8, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management. We produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the fourth
quarter, up 8% versus a year ago, that driven by our leading ultra-high net worth business, Ayco, and our newly
acquired United Capital high-net worth business, and our Consumer Banking businesses. For the full year,
Consumer & Wealth Management generated net revenues of $5.2 billion, essentially unchanged versus a year
ago, as strong Consumer Banking growth and higher management and other fees offset lower incentive fees.
For the quarter, Wealth Management net revenues included record management and other fees of $967 million,
up 17% versus last year, reflecting organic growth and the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision
rose to $561 billion at year-end. We also saw lower incentive fees, while private banking and lending revenues
were relatively stable.
Consumer Banking revenues were $228 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 20% versus last year,
reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and higher loan balances. Consumer deposits
at year-end totaled $60 billion across the US and UK, up nearly 70% versus last year. Funded consumer loan
balances totaled approximately $7 billion, of which $5 billion were from Marcus' consumer loans and $2 billion
from credit card lending. The slowing pace of growth in our Marcus unsecured loan business reflected the
anticipated growth in our credit card lending from the launch of Apple Card. While still in early stages of growth,
our Consumer business generated a total of $864 million in revenues for the firm this year from a standing start
just three years ago.
Now let's turn to page 9 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total client assets for which we earn a
management fee, including those in Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management, totaled a record
$1.9 trillion in the fourth quarter, up $97 billion versus the third quarter and $317 billion versus a year ago. Our
2019 growth was driven by $108 billion of long-term fee-based net inflows from fixed income and equity, including
the acquisition of United Capital, $65 billion of liquidity net inflows, and $144 billion of market appreciation.
Switching gears on page 10, let's address net interest income and our lending portfolio. Total firm-wide NII was
$1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year driven by loan growth. This NII
measure is more comprehensive than the one we previously highlighted in debt I&L and most notably now
includes all NII from Global Markets activities. For the full year 2019, we reported NII of $4.4 billion, up 16%,
driven by deposit and loan growth in Consumer & Wealth Management, increased lending in Investment Banking
as well as more lending activity in Global Markets.
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance. Our total loan portfolio was approximately $109 billion, up
approximately $4 billion sequentially and up $11 billion versus a year ago with the year-over-year increase
encompassing corporate, commercial real estate, wealth management, and Apple Card loans.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Our provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $336 million, up $45 million versus last quarter, driven
primarily by idiosyncratic wholesale impairments and loan growth in our Apple Card portfolio. Provisions related to
our Marcus portfolio were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter.
Our firm-wide net charge-off ratio increased by 20 basis points sequentially to approximately 70 basis points in
the fourth quarter. Our losses remain in line with our expectations given the current point in the cycle. We
continue to monitor the portfolio and broader risk factors and believe our credit exposure remains appropriately
sized.
We also take note that in 2020 we will experience a full year of loan loss provisioning related to growth in the
Apple Card portfolio. This growth in provisions will occur under the new CECL accounting standard which requires
reserves for the expected life of loan.
Importantly, the reserve build for growing credit card portfolio does not reflect actual economic losses.
Incremental reserve build will depend on loan growth, but given our expectations for card growth, we expect our
2020 total firm-wide loan loss provision to be higher than in 2019.
With regard to CECL adoption, based on our loan portfolio as of year-end 2019, we expect to record a day one
increase to our reserves of approximately $825 million in the first quarter which will not impact our income
statement or EPS. This will result in a one-time after-tax reduction to retained earnings of approximately $625
million which for regulatory capital purposes will be phased in over the prescribed transition period.
Next, let's turn to expenses on page 11. Our total operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased $2.1 billion versus
the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting higher compensation and litigation expense in the quarter as well as our
continued investment for growth.
On compensation, as we have said in the past, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are
committed to compensating top talent. Our full year compensation ratio of 33.8% is roughly flat versus 2018, and
our compensation expenses were flat year-over-year. Over the course of 2019, we reduced compensation
expenses across many of our businesses to improve operating efficiency and to support incremental
compensation expenses related to our growth initiatives where revenue production is beginning to materialize. As
we have said in the past, longer term, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we
build new scale platform businesses.
On non-compensation expense, our cost for the full year 2019 rose 13% versus last year with litigation expenses
and investment spend contributing to that growth. Specifically, litigation expenses accounted for 300 basis points
of the percentage increase, while investments in technology and new businesses, including specifically Marcus,
Apple Card, transaction banking, and United Capital, added another 300 basis points. We also incurred additional
expenses from our consolidated investments.
For the full year, the total pre-tax impact of our organic business projects including Marcus, Apple Card, and
transaction banking is approximately $700 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 70 basis points on our ROE. At
Investor Day, we will talk more about our plans for these businesses to scale over the coming years and how we
expect them to be accretive to our returns. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 68%, which includes a 340
basis point impact from litigation expense.
Finally, on taxes, our reported tax rate was 17% for the fourth quarter and 20% for the year. Our tax rate this
quarter reflected the impact of updated guidance from the US Treasury regarding the BEAT tax and incorporates

an adjustment to prior quarterly accruals relating to this guidance. Given this updated guidance, we expect our tax
rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%.
Turning to select balance sheet data on slide 12, let's begin with capital. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was
13.3% using the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially driven by lower shareholders' equity.
Our ratio under the advanced approach increased by 30 basis points to 13.7% due to enhancements in loss given
default severity modeling that were favorable to the ratio. Our SLR of 6.2% was flat sequentially.
During the full year 2019, we returned a total of $6.9 billion of capital to common shareholders through both share
repurchases and common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 362
million shares, down over 30% from our peak in 2010. Our book value per share was $219, up 5% versus a year
ago.
As you will recall, our share repurchase authorization for the 2020 CCAR cycle beginning in the third quarter of
2019 was $7 billion or $1.75 billion a quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased only $673 million, carrying
forward the unused authorization. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.2 billion, utilizing approximately $400
million of the prior quarter's unutilized capacity. Going forward, we carry a repurchase authorization of
approximately $4.2 billion over the next six months.
As we make capital return decisions, we will continue to balance our priorities of prudent capital management and
the return of capital in excess of what is needed for investment that is shareholder accretive. As such, the
magnitude of our forward repurchases will as always depend on our earnings, capital levels and competing
investment opportunities.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the year at $993 billion, essentially unchanged versus the
third quarter and up 7% versus last year driven by higher client activity and areas of growth across the firm. On
the liabilities side, our total deposits increased to $190 billion, up $32 billion versus last year while our total
unsecured long-term borrowings were $207 billion, down $17 billion over the same period.
Over the full year, we refinanced approximately $20 billion of parent vanilla debt maturities with approximately $5
billion of issuance, relying more significantly on our growth in retail and other deposits as we continue to diversify
our funding sources. This trend toward deposit growth and reduction in unsecured long-term borrowings should
continue.
Before taking questions, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the $5 billion organic growth initiative
announced in 2017. That initiative comprised a number of important efforts on which we continue to execute,
including client expansion in Investment Banking, wallet share growth in Global Markets, consumer loan and
deposit growth, lending and financing deployment and Asset Management growth.
As we go forward, we will continue to execute on these initiatives, but our focus and communication will instead
reflect more ambitious firm-wide performance targets to be introduced on Investor Day. We will not be focused on
revenue targets but rather on returns and efficiency consistent with our broader long-term strategic plans to drive
shareholder value. These targets will also reflect growth opportunities that were not included in the original $5
billion such as transaction banking and credit cards. We look forward to discussing our new targets in detail at the
end of the month.
In conclusion, our fourth quarter was strong, leading to full year performance that was in line with the evolving
macro environment and reflective of our continued investment in new businesses. We aim to operate more

efficiently and drive higher returns in the future and look forward to sharing our medium- and long-term objectives

Hi. Thanks very much. I don't know what to expect on this one. So doing more lending across the franchise and it
clearly is working and you now break out for us intermediation versus financing in trading or in markets, and I
think there's opportunity to do more there. Some of your peers do a lot more on the financing side. So the small
question is, are we going to see more at Investor Day in terms of metrics that we can help model and build and
evaluate performance on? And that's question one on that.
And question two on that is, can – how quickly can you expect those to, A, grow and B, enhance returns over the
next year or two?

Sure. Thanks, Glenn. It's Stephen. I'll take your question. I guess on the small question you asked, which is
should you expect more disclosure and the frequency of it? I think the answer is ultimately yes.
As it relates to lending broadly around the firm, there are a number of categories of lending that will over time
become more material and as they become more material, we will both by obligation but equally by interest look
to provide incremental more information on that lending. I would say Consumer is a good example of that as
between unsecured consumer lending and equally what we're doing on the credit card side.
I think broadly speaking in lending, I would say, mindful of the cycle, our clear plan is to grow financing revenues
in both FICC and Equities, to answer your direct question. And I would say the type of lending that's going on
there is largely in the repo business in FICC. It's in prime in Equities.
I think from a credit risk point of view, we like and can digest and evaluate that risk notwithstanding where we sit
in the cycle more broadly. And I think metrics in Global Markets around that lending again will continue to grow
out.
Last thing I'll say as it relates to Investor Day, look, we're going to lay out certain targets at the enterprise level.
We will be more disclosive about individual businesses, but I think equally important, Investor Day will be the
beginning and not the end of a dialogue around this so that the numbers just don't stand-alone and we give you
context for rate of growth and how we're managing it.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. I appreciate anything there. And then on the expanding the corporate client base, the specific question I
have is, are you fully cut over on processing Goldman's cash management payments? And where are we in terms
of dialogue with signing on any clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So in transaction banking, as we have said from its inception, we would be the first customer and then we
would look to bring on clients of the firm. We are the first customer, and I think as was mentioned during the
script, we have been processing payments on behalf of the firm across five currencies and totaling about $2
trillion in terms of what's getting processed. And so that's going well, and the firm is obviously benefiting from that
as in, to the extent that we keep as a customer lower operational deposits on deposit with commercial banks in
that regard. We have all along been in dialogue with clients of the firm, first in the context of getting their sense
and input as to what this platform ought to look like, how would we design it, so as to meet pain points that they
are experiencing.
That collaborative engagement has been going on, and we are now engaging these clients as future customers of
the firm in the context of transaction banking with certain of them already putting operational deposits on deposit
with the bank. And I think as we've said, in 2020, you'll see that client roster and that participation in the business
grow.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, David and Stephen. Firstly, thank you for the new disclosure. It's very helpful. My first question is
on credit provisions. It looks like about a third of the credit provisions are – and the vast majority of sequential
quarter increase in provisions came from the Asset Management division. But when I look at sort of the NII
disclosure on page 10, it looks like only 15% of NII comes from Asset Management. So not sure what the
mismatch is there. But just let me just step back here a little bit, help us understand what exact kind of lending
goes on in the Asset Management division, maybe a bit more color on the credit quality there and the overall
return profile of that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Christian, for the question. So let me start with kind of the geography and the segment. So in our
Asset Management business sits alternatives lending. So think about that as a portion of the old debt I&L. So this
is mezz and lending that's made on a principle basis. So what you see reflected in that line is both net interest
income that's derived from those assets and equally volatility in the valuation of those debt assets themselves. So
that describes the geography of it.
In terms of what played out over the course of the year in provisioning, so the delta in provisioning for the full year
was $390 million. About $100 million of that was found in the Consumer & Wealth Management business, and the
vast majority of that was related to provisioning to the growth in Apple Card. I should point out it was not related to

any either impairments or off model, if you will, provisioning related to the balance of the Consumer business. It
was related to growth in Apple Card.
The balance of the $390 million, call it $300 million or so, related to impairments on loans across a variety of
different segments, Asset Management being one, Investment Banking being the other and that was around
corporate wholesale credit. It involved impairments across a range of different industries, most notably in energy,
some in manufacturing, none of which were material in the context of the firm. And so that's the way the
provisioning divided up as between impairments and loan loss provisioning for the growth largely in the Apple
Card portfolio.

Maybe stepping back on the balance sheet as a whole, you're kind of sitting close to $1 trillion, which is more or
less kind of the highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. So just help us understand just broadly speaking
what's driving growth and sort of the returns you're getting for deploying incremental balance sheet? And then just
longer term, how critical is balance sheet growth to driving revenue growth and how does that sort of factor your
longer term thinking around capital return?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So I would say a couple of things. First, as a general matter, our balance sheet growth is itself purely a
function of being in the service of client demand. So we're guided entirely by where demand lies for client
petitioning of the firm in the context of the flow of our business. So over the course of 2019, we deployed balance
sheet by example against repo where there was demand for liquidity particularly in the context of the various
uncertainty that existed in the repo market. We grew balance sheet, so as to stand as an intermediary of liquidity
for our clients. So it grows as a function of client demand.
I think as we think about areas of balance sheet growth, we think about it purely in the context of accretive returns
for the firm. It's not a revenue-driven proposition. It is really about, can we deploy balance sheet on behalf of
clients so as to generate accretive returns to the firm? And that's kind of the true north, if you will. That's where
the compass points in terms of how our balance sheet ultimately fluctuates.
And candidly, as the CFO, I look at balance sheet much as I do liquidity or any other resource around the firm as
allocating in the pursuit of accretive growth-oriented opportunities and shareholder return for our stakeholders.

Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, just revenue trends were strong in the quarter.
I think you mentioned corporate sentiment is still a bit muted which I think can take more time. So just curious if
you're seeing any improvement on the corporate front and then on the institutional side, were there any asset
purchases during the quarter that had much impact on Global Markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. There's no question, I think that the environment during the course of the
year improved as the year went on, and while I'd say corporate sentiment has still lagged a little, particularly given
some of the macro overlays like US-China trade, et cetera, there's no question in the fourth quarter the
environment improved.
Based on the data or information we can see across activity and dialogue with clients, I would say that it's
improved in the fourth quarter and the trends that we're seeing early into 2020 are a little bit more positive. And so
those would be the usual things that we could look at across activity set.
With respect to your second question, there were no material asset purchases that impacted Global Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just quick follow-up on the efficiency ratio. I'm sure you guys will get into that in two weeks, and
there is a lot of noise this quarter. But I think in the past you mentioned I think 2019 kind of being the height of
investments. I just want to get an update on does that still pertain and we should start to see some improvement
on the efficiency ratio as the revenues in some of the newer areas start to gain traction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Michael. So on the efficiency ratio, at Investor Day, in my presentation, I will go through kind of that
migration and give you the elements of it. Obviously it feeds both in the context of revenue and expense, and so
we'll go through that.
In terms of your question on the height of investment, I have said and would reiterate here that 2019 is the depth
of investment when you look at investment across three of our discrete products, namely, Marcus, Apple Card
and transaction banking. And equally I'd made that reference and again reiterate here, excluding the reserve
calculation, which I obviously spoke of in the context of the prepared remarks.
So when you look at the investment ex reserve, 2019 for those three initiatives is the lower point, and I think we'll
start to see reduced expenditures relating to that. I would say that overall, and then again this relates back a bit to
your efficiency question, my expectation around non-compensation expense ex litigation is that it would run
roughly flat in 2020 relative to where we are.
The whole ambition of what we're doing around expenses is trying to create operating leverage and efficiency so
as to continue to fund investments around the firm. And that's not investment limited to the three products that I
spoke about, but equally across technology investment around the infrastructure of the firm and the like and so
we'll start to see that play out. Obviously in the context of flat expenses year-over-year, our hope and expectation

is that we'll start to see higher revenue generation from some of these investments, which will play out positively
in the context of the efficiency ratio itself.

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So wanted to start off just digging into some of the new segment disclosures, particularly the Consumer & Wealth
side of the business and clearly what stood out most to us, and you alluded to this earlier in the call, was the pre-
tax margin running much lower, somewhere close to 10%. Clearly the new business initiatives, the significant
drag that that's had on the margin, is quite evident. But I was hoping you could speak to what inning you're in
currently just in terms of the platform build out and new investment for that strategy specifically and just through
the cycle how we could think about long-term pre-tax margin potential for that segment as you continue to scale
and maybe begin to run a bit closer to some of the peer comps?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So let me answer the question generally. We have disclosed obviously information around expenses and
pre-tax. Our intention at Investor Day is to go to pre-tax margin and returns across the whole of the business. And
then in the context that that will provide you in Investor Day, our intent is to continue to do that on quarterly
earning calls like this. So you should have an expectation that we'll continue along that path.
I'd also say, and I'll reflect on this here generally, but more specifically in our Investor Day, our intent is not to
leave you in the dark as to the Consumer & Wealth Management segment in terms of overall margins, meaning
we want to give you a sense of where the Wealth business sits, that is the PWM business, which obviously
demonstrates a much higher margin than what the segment reveals with the segment being in effect burdened by
the continued growth in investment spend in the consumer space. So we will separate that out.
My guidance to you in terms of expectation is that the Wealth Management segment or sub-segment within that
performs at a much more market level margin than the way in which the segment otherwise illustrates. But, again,
we will decompose that for you with context as we move forward.

No, that's great to hear, Stephen. And just one follow-up from me as it relates to the provision. Appreciate the
detail you provided in earlier question. The guidance calling for higher provision in 2020, I don't think that comes
as a big surprise to anyone. But just given expectations for a healthy step up in provision, simply due to CECL
implementation and some consumer loan seasoning, I was hoping you could maybe help us frame a bit better
what's a reasonable provision level or run rate expectation if there's change in the macro but we simply have to
reflect the impact of CECL with an assumption that you'll see relatively steady growth in consumer loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Look. I think generally speaking our own budget is in the realm of call it $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in terms
of a broader budget. I would say a lot of that reflects continued growth in the Apple Card portfolio as well as
lending more generally. But, again, as you grow from a negligible level at the inception through to what we hold
both in terms of roughly $1.9 billion of where we are and what that growth will be in the ensuing year, obviously
that provision through 2020 will be exaggerated. You'll see it that way, but that's just part of the overall growth.
As an aside, the provisioning growth related to Apple Card, again more from a standing start is itself burdened by
CECL relative to where provisioning would have been. So it's marginally more exaggerated in the context of the
life of loan component to CECL and the like.
Now, what I offer you by way of budget is just that. It obviously will depend on the pace of loan growth broadly,
the pace of loan growth in Apple Card which we are going to calibrate based purely on risk parameters and our
own judgment about the tone and nature of the market in which we're operating.

Hi. I had a – it's a little bit of a philosophical question around lending and how you're thinking about your various
loan books, and the question is kind of coming from the perspective that I'm thinking you've been working with a
balance sheet that's a high velocity balance sheet and I'm wondering if you perceive your various loan books as
moving more from a velocity balance sheet towards a storage balance sheet, is there anything in there, I'm
thinking about do you hedge some of your loan books now? Are there some that you're going to continue to
hedge? Some that you would not consider hedging? Does it impact how we think about the capital and the capital

allocation to loans? I'm wondering if that resonates at all with how you're thinking about the loan books in the
various...

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

...segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, no, no. It's a very good question. I'd say the following. First, there's nothing about what we're doing in
growing our loan book particularly around Consumer, for example, that is in effect substitution for business that
we'll continue to do of a capital markets orientation around lending. So for example – and we look at the two
consistent with trends that each market shows and kind of risk parameters and levers that we hold to manage
risk.
I'll give an example. If you think about corporate lending, so for example lending we make by way of acquisition
financing that we provide to our clients, what I look at in the context of our deal book has a lot to do with size but
equally with velocity turn. So, right now, our deal book turns at inside of three months.
That's an important metric to think about as we manage corporate lending and capital markets related lending
that's going on. That's less of a relevant consideration if you will in the context of growth in our consumer loan
book or what we do around Apple Card as a component of that. There, we're quite careful to consider what we do
about provisioning, how we think about the qualitative overlay to the size of our provisioning as we look at a
maturation of that portfolio, start to look at more on-premise data as it relates to our consumer portfolio as
opposed to third party metrics.
And so, we think about these two things in some sense differently in terms of what you apply by way of the rigor
and metric and overlay in managing that risk, but equally we obviously look at the totality of lending that's going
on and the rate of growth as it relates to the overall balance sheet in the firm itself. So I hope that's helpful and
sort of our broad philosophical approach to lending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And does it then come back towards capital and what kind of capital ratios you need? What I'm hearing is on the
consumer side, maybe more capital consumptive, but obviously there's an ROA associated with that that should
pay for it, whereas on the banking side that velocity suggests that it might not be as capital consumptive as
commercial whole loan in a different organization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. In a way I'd answer that question again to sort of stick to sort of a broad view of it all from the firm, we're
driving and growing new businesses at the firm that inevitably will carry with them more durable and recurring fee
revenue. They therefore will by definition carry with it less stress loss in the context of it. They will in some sense

be less capital dense than where they have been. And so, we're going to evaluate risk return against the capital
that's required, against each individual business, and render judgments there as to what those returns look like on
a capital adjusted basis, where we want to deploy capital, where we don't. I guess what I'm suggesting to you is
it's a much more dynamic process than not, but overall it fits within the component of growing and building
businesses that have less stress draw and therefore the potential for lower density from a capital perspective.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Stephen, I think you said non-comp should be flat in 2020. But in 2019 almost every non-comp category went
higher. So is that specifically because – just why is that, is the question, what's changing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, Mike, maybe the way to answer that is let me decompose a little bit of the growth year-over-year in
non-comp expense. So, as you know, we reported a 13% increase in non-comp expense. About 3% was related
to litigation. I'm not going to sort of foreshadow of where that will be, but just understand in the component of
growth, 3% of the 13% was just that. About another 3% to 4% was related to broader investment around the firm,
whether that's tech investment, consumer, transaction banking and United Capital. Now, that's going to grow, but
that segment of non-comp expense is going to start to sort of graduate off as those businesses start to hit a
certain level of maturity. And as I have said, we're looking to prune expenses all around the firm so as to create
operating leverage and fund the continue investment expense that's there.
And then finally I would say there are certain elements of investment entities and other components of expense
growth in non-comp that equally will come off over time. So I just draw that out. What I do want to tell you is that
as we get to Investor Day, we're going to give you a certain expense target that we're going to look to harvest out
of the firm in very concrete terms that will help feed what I've been describing which is an objective of creating
capacity for reinvestment in the firm over time. And so that's why when I guide you that direction as being flat, it is
consistent with creating that capacity. There will be growth. Some of the growth will come off. Others will be
funded by capacity we create in and around the firm.

All right. That's helpful. And then just one big picture question. Both David and you, Stephen, mentioned well-
functioning and constructive capital markets, you said the trends early in 2020 are more positive. I guess, why do
you think that's the case? And do you think this time it's different versus the past decade? Do you think these
improvements are sustainable or not? Or what's your level of conviction? In other words, we haven't heard you on

reiterate some of the things that I said, and hopefully it will be helpful context. So I do think the economic
environment at the moment is constructive. What I said on the call about the US economy and our expectation of
growth of about 2% in 2020, we have relatively high conviction on, I can give you a set of things from a macro or

geopolitical perspective that could change which would significantly shock confidence and therefore change that
picture, but I think the chance of that happening in 2020 at this point seems low. It's not zero, but it doesn't seem
likely.
I think that there's been a slight improvement, and that's what I said when I was asked earlier when we were
talking about corporate sentiment, a slight improvement in corporate sentiment as we came to the end of the year,
and there was some progress in the year on some of the macro overhang that would have a tendency to affect
corporate sentiment. And so I think you have a slightly more positive corporate sentiment heading into 2020, and I
do see some indications around deal activity that look a little stronger in the fourth quarter and as we step into the
first quarter of this year. So I do think it's constructive.
I made comments with respect to sluggishness in Europe, but a little bit more constructive on China, again, with a
little bit of a clearing of the US-China as a step forward, that might remove some slight headwinds. But I don't
know how to give you a relative. I think our general point of view is on the distribution of outcomes, the highly
most likely outcome is we have a relatively benign economic environment in 2020.

some commentary on this. When we look at the movement of partners through the cycle, the two-year cycle of
partners, and we have an election coming up this fall, there is nothing about the movement in 2019 that looks
different to us than the movement we have seen over the first year of the last number of cycles. So we have
movement in our partnership. It's part of the culture of the partnership that younger partners have brought up, and
despite some of the dialogue around it, we don't see anything significant about the movement of partners at this
point in the cycle.

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So what we've tried to do – and at the Investor Day, we'll give you more color on this and kind of walk you through
a plan around it. We've run an alternative business that has been some client capital and balance sheet capital.
And in the context of that client capital and balance sheet capital, the business has been housed in multiple
different businesses spread across the firm. We have now brought all those businesses together in one business,
and we have put together and are moving forward with a plan to significantly increase the institutional client
money that we manage with that infrastructure around the globe. Historically, we have managed some
institutional money, but we have managed very significant private wealth money in addition to using our balance
sheet.
On a go-forward basis, we don't plan to grow the balance sheet, but we will continue to use balance sheet. But we
will remix that balance sheet so that the RWA density is different and it's less capital intensive. But the primary
growth plan for the business is to over time raise a significantly increased amount of institutional capital that
appreciates the fact that our consolidated alternative platform is broad, global, and deep, and that we operate in
all the different categories: private equity, growth equity, credit, infrastructure, real estate, and we also do it all
over the world and have resources all over the world to execute on that. And that is very attractive to the large
institutional capital raisers, and we have not traditionally attacked or partnered with them across this broad
platform. And so at Investor Day, we'll give you more color on how we plan to do that and what you can expect
from that over the coming five years.

James Mitchell Q

That's really helpful. Is there any challenge, or do you find in competing with your more pure-play competitors that
are publicly traded, do you think there's some sort of disadvantage in raising institutional money, having your
hands in other businesses? Or you don't think that's an issue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, we have been in these businesses for 30 years, and we have executed well in these businesses for 30
years. We have also been a leader in providing services to those businesses that you refer to. We have an active
dialogue with those companies about our activities and what we plan to do. And John, Stephen, and I are

extremely focused on the client orientation and the client nature in the context of the way we run the firm. The
other firms that are out there have very, very ambitious institutional capital raising plans from institutions, but
there's a lot of capital to allocate. And we're very comfortable that they can raise a lot of capital. We can raise a lot
of capital. What's interesting about this business is this is a business that actually is growing secularly. And so, we
think we're very well positioned given where we are both to participate but also to continue to service those clients
in a differentiated and value-added way.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Actually, my question was related to that last one, which is, looking at the Asset Management segment and
$22 billion of mainly private equity investments, I guess the question is, if you put it in the context of the publicly
traded alternatives, Blackstone has a pretty big business, and their GP investments is about $1.8 billion by
comparison. And so, what is the strategic need for and rationale for keeping that large of a balance sheet
commitment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So we have a differentiated model, and there's no question that Blackstone operates the business with no capital.
If maybe we were starting today from scratch with a white sheet of paper, you might develop the business
differently. But what's happened because of the way we run our business is we have built out a very, very broad,
deep global network of investors all over the world, and we think that's a real asset to capital allocators. We have
done that because we have built up strength investing off our balance sheet.
And historically, candidly, one of the things investors have liked is they like the fact that we partner with them and
we have skin in the game and we're committed to investments with them. That alignment I think is a very, very
good thing, and I think that will be a differentiated component of our strategy here. And so strategically, that's
something I think that differentiates us in the context of the strategy. Also as we grow new products and services
in the space around the world and add to what we're doing it is easier to fund the acceleration of that if you do
have the capacity to use balance sheet to jumpstart some of those businesses.
So, again, going back to what I said before, we would not expect the balance sheet to grow. We would expect to
change the RWA density by shifting some out of equity into more credit or infrastructure-type assets. But we think
we have a competitive advantage or a different strategy that's a good advantage to partner with our clients and
we plan to continue it.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hey, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Hey. I guess first question here, so I saw the Marcus app was rolled out last week. And I'm just curious, what took
so long I guess to get that out, and how are you thinking about integrating that with some of the other products in
Consumer and really integrating it with Clarity Money in that app as well? And really the question is I'm just trying
to understand some of the branding in Consumer and what you're going to be using, call it, as a digital storefront.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, on the Marcus app, when we first began Marcus three years ago, you will recall that our two products were
deposits and unsecured loans. So the utility of the app early on was not quite high, meaning people who carry a
loan are not looking to check on it with the frequency of those that use apps for their day-to-day exchange. And
so, we sort of set a set of priorities for ourselves in terms of the direction we were going to build, and we would
ultimately come upon the app.
I would say from the moment we began to think about the design of the app, and in fact bringing Clarity Money
into the house, the idea was to take the best of the technology, that is, what Clarity Money had developed, which
was super interesting in terms of prompts and the use of intelligence to do that, and kind of a two-way
engagement with the user or consumer of the app, we wanted to embed that in a broader app that we would roll
out. So you're seeing the first phase of that now, particularly as people will start to engage more and more with us
again with greater frequency than they did at the start. And we're embedding the best of what is Clarity Money in
the context of the creation of that app overall. And so, it was really a question of anticipated use, slower at the
start, faster now, a question of priorities, and now bringing it together.
On your question about branding, I think I'll defer you to Investor Day when we'll talk a lot more with much greater
context than I could answer in a single question on the branding strategy around Consumer and around Wealth
Management more broadly.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
And then just a follow-up here, modeling the comp ratio and cadence moving forward. So the fourth quarter comp
ratio was about 600 basis points below the first quarter level. I know that's much tighter than the historical
relationship, and I also know consistent with how you're now looking to accrue on more of a real-time basis. You
also had a very strong fourth quarter for equity investment performance, which I would think have a lower comp
ratio, too. So I'm just trying to get some flavor for whether the 2019, call that, relationship is a decent proxy on a
quarterly basis, or the stronger fourth quarter in the equity performance maybe skew that a bit lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So let me start from the top. As you know, our comp and benefits line was flat year-over-year, and our comp
to net revenue number was roughly in line, slightly higher than where it was last year. So that's to look at the full
year. Embedded in your question was in fact the right reference, which is, as I have said several times, we are
accruing for compensation each quarter as the accounting standards require, which is our best estimate of the
compensation we would need. And so, we have done that much more on a straight line without relying or waiting
on the fourth quarter, so as to be a bigger adjustment. And so you're seeing more straight line. Because of that,
you're seeing this fourth quarter variability relative to where we were in the past. That's just a function of the way
in which we are now accounting. Again, more of a straight line than not.
I would say just to step back from the particulars, I think that from a compensation point of view, we had taken
payroll and compensation expense down in a number of different businesses over the year in order to redeploy
compensation to populations of people that are working on some of the growth businesses that we have. By
definition, that compensation dollar is not producing an equal amount of revenue as it would in other areas. It will
as those businesses grow and mature. And so part of this is a reallocation of compensation in that direction while
maintaining comp and benefits at a constant or flat year-over-year and reflecting in on the comp to net revenue
number being roughly flat as well.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I was wondering – and you may not be able to answer this question today, which is fine. And if you can't, possibly
you may want to give us this detail at Investor Day. But in the regulatory filings for all the banks, there's a category
of loans called loans to non-depository financial institutions. And when we look at that for the top banks, like your
own, the growth has been pretty impressive since 2013. And when we look at it for your organization back then it
was about $6.7 billion, and today it's approximately $43 billion. So the question is what's in that portfolio? And,
again, if you don't have the details, I understand. But maybe you could share with us on Investor Day some good
details of what's in that portfolio.

Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So I think – I want to give you an answer with some specificity. So let me suggest that Heather Miner and
her team get back in touch with you, and we can itemize as is publicly disclosed, what exactly sits in that
category. And we can give you some progression of how that's migrated. I just don't have the particulars around
that to hand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's okay. That's not unusual, by the way. When we ask this question of other banks, most people don't really
give us the details. But that's fine. Then the second question, can you give us some color – obviously the Apple
Card received a wonderful amount of publicity, and Apple is branded of course as a card created by them and not
a bank type of logo. The question I have is, Apple is obviously very respectful of their brand and their customers.
And in a recession, we all know unemployment goes up and we also know that credit card delinquencies are
linked to unemployment. Is there anything that concerns you that as we go into a recession, say unemployment
goes to 6%, delinquencies for all credit cards more than double from where we are today, are you going to be
hamstrung trying to collect those delinquencies because of the way it's been branded as an Apple Card and as
not a bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So thanks for the question. I want to be really clear on this. Notwithstanding whoever lays claim to the
creation of the card, there's only one institution that's making underwriting decisions, and that's Goldman Sachs.
So Goldman Sachs is making all of the underwriting decisions as it relates to it. We have set targets and goals
and objectives along with Apple as a good partner would, and Apple is completely in the know as to sort of how
we are going about these underwriting decisions. But the ultimate decision sits with us, and so we
calibrate/manage our risks and collections in the context of that. And so I think I just want to be really clear about
that. It is the bank that renders underwriting decisions in that regard.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. I'll be quick here. It looks like on the consumer side you saw deposits go up about $5 billion this
quarter, but you seem that you have better growth when you enter into new markets. Is there any type of
geographic expansion that you're planning within the markets business that can kind of accelerate growth on
deposits there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Thank you. That question has come up frequently. Obviously the primary growth is in the US. In the
UK, we have seen considerable growth in deposits, which has really pleased us even relative to the early
expectations. We have looked at a variety of other jurisdictions in terms of where we could raise deposits.
Germany as a name has come up several times. It's natural that it would. In the context of Brexit and planning
and doing more asset generation into our European business, I think we'll wait and see how things progress
around Brexit, the size, magnitude, and pace of asset growth there before we make a decision about where we

next plant the flag from a deposit perspective. And so, there are no immediate plans in terms of next jurisdiction,
but we continue to evaluate it. And we have built the platform particularly in the UK with embedding greater
flexibility for us to open it or open a new jurisdiction without building from ground zero. And so, it was planned with
that in mind.
