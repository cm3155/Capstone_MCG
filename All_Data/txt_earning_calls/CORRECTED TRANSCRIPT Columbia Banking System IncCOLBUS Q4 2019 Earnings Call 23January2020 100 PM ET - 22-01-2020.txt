Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session through both the telephone and the Web. Instructions will

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us on today's call as we review our fourth quarter
and full year 2019 results which we released before the market opened this morning. The earnings release and
the supplemental slide presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
Due to the hard work and dedication of our talented bankers, 2019 was our best year ever. We achieved record
loan production while maintaining our disciplines that have produced industry-leading credit quality. All of these
factors combined generated record annual earnings exceeding the prior-year high set in 2018 by 12%. The
tireless efforts of all of our team members who continually collaborate to do the right thing for our clients and the
communities we serve are evident in these results.
Our leadership transition went very smooth. Our longstanding approach to developing bench strength through
ready-now succession planning provided the blueprint for a seamless rotation of leadership assignments. Our
recent announcements have resulted in some new names for you but these are all leaders with a long track
record of delivering exceptional performance.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Our current executive team, including the recent additions, have an average tenure with Columbia of roughly nine
years. I want to take this opportunity to reinforce our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders,
employees and clients. The two new executive leadership additions were done in support of our commitment to
the seamless integration of technology to drive efficiencies and increased client and employee satisfaction. David
Moore Devine and Eric Eid are both seasoned professionals who have been an integral part of Columbia's
success over the past decade. I'm confident that their talent will support our future growth and enhance franchise
value for many years to come.
On the call with me today our Greg Sigrist, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide details about our earnings
performance; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating Officer who will review our production activity and highlight the
status of some of the initiatives we've been working on; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer who will
provide some commentary on the credit performance. Following our prepared comments, we'll be happy to
answer your questions.
Let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on the
forward-looking comments, please refer to our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Greg to review our financial performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Clint. We achieved record earnings of $194.5 million and EPS of $2.68 in 2019, reflecting strong loan
and deposit production, a tempered credit environment and a focus on driving net interest income. Fourth quarter
earnings of $46.1 million and EPS of $0.64 per diluted share was our best fourth quarter ever and amongst the
strongest in our history.
Despite the interest rate environment, net interest income was up nearly 2% in the quarter to $124.8 million,
reflecting the continued benefit of loan growth and our proactive efforts to mitigate exposure to falling rates.
Operating NIM was down 3 basis points from the linked quarter, with key drivers being lower loan yields partially
offset by lower funding costs. Total deposits ended the year at nearly $10.7 billion, down approximately $171
million from the prior quarter. We did have a planned outflow of public funds of approximately $300 million in the
quarter. As we have said previously, public funds are more often akin to wholesale funding and will be used as an
alternative funding source when economically beneficial to do so.
Noninterest income of $21.8 million was down from the prior quarter largely due to the $5.9 million gain on sale of
owned real estate during the third quarter and was up $1.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. We
have continued to make progress in generating noninterest income, especially in loan, card and financial services
revenues.
Our expense run rate remained stable with fourth quarter noninterest expense of $87 million, essentially flat to the
third quarter. Our core noninterest expense ratio was 2.53% for the quarter as compared to 2.69% in the prior
year quarter. For the full year, this ratio was 2.59% as compared to 2.68% for the prior year. The full year 2019
expense impact of our digital initiatives was $6.9 million, including $1 million in the fourth quarter.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Overall, we have had success on negotiating favorable contract pricing and have been able to capitalize more
costs than expected. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 19.5%, which is within our target range of 19% to
20%.
In-line with our comments in the last earnings call, we are expecting the Day 1 impact of adopting CECL to be
fairly muted. Additional details will be available when we file our Form 10-K.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter's record loan production of $427 million, exceeded
the previous record set in the third quarter of 2018 and propelled us to a new annual record of $1.6 billion,
surpassing the record set last year by $142 million. For the past three years, we are focused on increasing our
production capacity. These efforts are directly correlated to the record results we announced.
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the expected seasonal reduction in line utilization but our bankers'
success on the production front offset this decline. Our loan pipeline remains strong and we are confident that we
can maintain this level of production while adhering to our credit discipline.
Our deposit base is very stable with the year-end mix of 59% Business and 41% Consumer, which is consistent
with our historical levels. Our cost of deposits continues to be lower than our peers, reflecting an even split
between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. We do expect our typical deposit seasonality in the
first quarter as clients draw down cash balances to pay down credit and other expenses.
Term loans comprised 72% of the production whereas lines were 28% of the total. The quarterly production mix
was 60% fixed, 34% floating, and 6% in variable. The overall portfolio is now 48% fixed, 34% floating, and 18%
variable.
New loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 4.36%, which
is lower than the overall portfolio rate of 4.69%. The portfolio rate declined 13 basis points during the quarter.
During the quarter, commercial and multifamily real estate production was 46% or $197 million of total production
and C&I was 41% or $177 million of the total. Commercial and multifamily real estate loan totals were up $208
million during the quarter, driven by increases in office, warehouse, healthcare and multifamily sectors.
Approximately $100 million of the increase was offset by a decrease in commercial real estate construction
balances as loans moved to permanent status. C&I loans were down to $105 million, driven by seasonal activity
in public administration, agriculture and manufacturing sectors.
During the quarter, we completed the consolidation of a branch bringing the total to four branches in our Puget
Sound and Oregon markets for the year. We believe our retail delivery strategy will continue to be a blend of our
physical and digital presence.
I recently announced Executive Vice President and Director of Retail Banking and Digital Integration, Nicole
Sherman, is responsible for blending both. We believe she is uniquely positioned to do this based on her 25 years
of banking experience, including the roll out of Columbia's NeighborHub branch concept. We will continue to
actively look at markets across our footprint to assess where we want to better position our branch network.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Digital is one piece of our expansion and we will continue the journey from a community banking perspective. We
expect improvements in our peer-to-peer money transfer capabilities, online deposit account opening and our
small business lending capabilities to go online later this year.
Now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. In summary, credit quality remained very stable in the fourth quarter. NPAs/total assets were
essentially unchanged as was past dues and problem loans.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were minimal at 1 basis point and for the year they were only 3 three basis points.
Our fourth quarter provision for loan and lease losses was $1.6 million including $2.3 million for the originated
portfolio, offset by a release of $700,000 for the acquired portfolios. The provision in the originated portfolio was
primarily driven by loan growth of $103 million, along with a modest amount of negative migrations which is not
unexpected at this time of year due to the seasonal nature of some of our customers.
For the year, the provision for loan and lease losses was $3.5 million, which included $5.7 million for the
originated portfolio in alignment with our record loan production and was offset by a recapture of $2.2 million in
the acquired portfolios. Again, loan production was the primary driver as the originated portfolio grew $796 million
for the year. Offsetting this growth was contraction in the acquired portfolios of $444 million which allowed for the
re-leases.
As of December 31, 2019, our allowance to total loans increased by 2 basis points during the quarter to 96 basis
points of total loans but was down 3 basis points year-over-year.
As always, we like to remind folks that this ratio is impacted by our acquisition and the associated loans that were
recorded at fair value. Embedded in those valuations is approximately $21 million of net discount, for which
approximately $13 million is associated with the Pacific Continental portfolio, $3 million with the West Coast
portfolio, and $2 million with the Intermountain portfolio.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Clint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Andy. Before we wrap up, I want to take a moment to thank Hadley Robbins for his service, guidance
and friendship. It has been my personal privilege to work with him and we are a stronger company because of his
leadership impact. All of us wish Hadley and Gayle a long and prosperous retirement.
Along with our financial results, we announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.28. We also declared a special
dividend of $0.22, which constitutes a payout ratio of 78% for the quarter. This quarter's dividend will be paid on
February 19 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 5.
This concludes our prepared comments. Chris, Andy, Greg and I are happy to answer your questions. Mike, now
we will open the call for questions.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time we would like to any questions you might have for us today. [Operator Instructions] Your
first question comes from [indiscernible] (00:13:43). Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi. Good morning, guys. How are you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good. Good morning, [ph] Luke (00:13:48).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Just a quick question first on just capital deployment, was the switch to the special dividend this quarter against
the repurchases in the previous couple of quarters, is that more price-dependent than anything else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes. With the upward movement in our stock price, it was a point where we felt like, from a capital management
perspective, reinstituting the special dividend for this quarter made more sense than repurchases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I just kind of wanted to move into – I think I have in my notes here that you
guys were beginning to offer online account opening in the first half of this year. Do you mind just giving an
update as to how that's tracking? And then just to follow-up on that is just the traction on the commercial online
platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
On the consumer front, the online account opening is projected around the second quarter or first half of this year.
As far as the commercial transformation that was completed last year, I believe, September-ish and we moved all
of our commercial clients to the new platform and it's performing very well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I think you guys have historically said that given the investment and the
digital spend over the past year and the kind of relinquishing of a lot of those projects, the increased capacity just
– and so I just wanted to see if you guys were continuing to kind of to say that you were going to move
downstream on M&A given the excess capacity for ability to integrate and stuff like that, I just wanted to see how
M&A conversations were going?

Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The conversations kind of ebb and flow, and anything that's percolating out there we generally have a view
into. We haven't changed our stance or thought process around our ability to move downstream on M&A with the
conclusion of most of our larger platform replacements and additions. So that's still very much our thought
process and it's just a matter of – with M&A, it takes a – a lot of it is just timing-dependent. But we're very active in
looking at who would be a good potential partner for us and – both from a business mix point of view as well as
culturally. And we continue to stay very busy just evaluating what the population or the pool of potential merger
candidates looks like.

Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll step back.

Hey. This is actually Levi Posen on for Jeff Rulis this morning. I just wanted to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Levi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Levi Posen Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about expenses and kind of strategy there. You
mentioned that the digital investment spend came out to be $6.9 million in 2019. I was just curious kind of where
we're at overall in some of those transitions to the digital platform. Kind of looking into 2020, are we expecting
more of that, less of the same, kind of what does that look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I assume you're referring at – from an expense perspective, I think in 2019, we completed roughly 30 projects. So
I think we always characterize that as being midstream. It's a three-year roadmap. I think, as we've talked about,
we've always said I think that the majority of the spend would come in 2019 and 2020. And then it's really the
operational efficiencies around the edges and just continued development beyond that. So I would characterize
this as being midstream right now.
And your knock-on question may be how much were we able to capitalize in 2019 above and beyond those $6.9
million that directly hit P&L, and the answer to that is $2.4 million has been deferred and/or put into depreciation
through the end of the year. So the total spend in 2019 was $9.5 million.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Okay. Great. And then kind of staying to the strategy topic, are you guys talking about any priority shifts in
strategy just with the change in management team coming around the same time that the rate seemed to quiet
down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. My comment during our prepared remarks about the average tenure of the folks on our Executive Committee
being roughly nine years, we've all been very much a part of setting the strategy and the path that we've been on
and executing on that and we've always bought into it, believe in it. So there's no hard right turns in terms of
strategic focus. We'll obviously continue to evolve. And some of the changes on the – or additions to the
executive team are an example of that evolution with our digital roadmap and the investments that we've made
and the ones that we continue to see on the horizon. It was very important for us to have that elevated and that
was the reason for bringing Eric Eid to the Executive Committee. In addition, we added a technical focus or a
digital focus to our Head of Retail position and that's once again focused on making sure that we get higher
adoption rates and realize a return on those investments.
And then with what we've done on the client and the employee experience side, that's become more important
than ever and having somebody that's – who's got a creative mind like David Moore Devine was very important
for us to elevate to the executive group as well. And so it's not a change in that strategic focus but it's more just
evolving as the industry continues to evolve and our customer base continues to evolve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Levi Posen Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Okay, great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And then, lastly, just wanted to ask a little bit – or one question
about the margin. It seems like there was some active management in the second half of 2019 with maybe cost of
funds and then also yields on more the security side, what does that look like going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I mean I would just say we're really maintaining the course that we've said and kind of articulated during
2019 in terms of how we're managing our exposure to potential falling rates.
So I don't think into 2020, there's any shift in the thought. To your point, in terms of the security strategy and kind
of the funding associated with that, we've been targeting $800 million related to that strategy, and year-end, we
probably – that hub expands a little bit. So I think – so the strategy hasn't changed. But I think in 2020, you'll see
us come down closer to that target range of $800 million. But otherwise, we feel very fortunate that we have the
tools in place when we needed them to manage the exposure to falling rates.

Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Arfstrom. Your line is open.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A few things; just bigger picture on loan production. You guys had a really good quarter relative to what you would
normally see this time of year. And I'm just curious if you could give us an idea of make a point on maybe one or
two things that might be different over the last few quarters? Is it taking more market share, is it existing clients
with more activity or what would you really point to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Jon, I think that's correct. So I think it's a combination of many things. In some of the comments we've talked
throughout the year of adding teams in certain locations, those teams came on-board and have produced very
well. And when you couple that with our experienced bankers that are out in the market, making calls, they're
driving a higher production from that aspect as well.
Other than that, I would tell you that it really falls into maintaining the credit discipline and our pricing discipline.
So, it's a balancing act. But it's really – it's for talented bankers that we have and the new folks that we brought on
that continue that production.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And just remind me, you typically see a little bit of strengthening in Q1 and then more in Q2, is that the right
way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, it's largely weather-dependent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We can see some strengthening towards the end of Q1, so focal date balances but typically not averages, but it
really is weather-dependent on the Ag sector and when they can get in the field. So right now, it's just hard for us
to handicap that.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then two follow-ups, one on the margin; help us understand what you're thinking about in terms
of the margin? I wouldn't call it a high-class problem but I'd call it a challenge because you have this big low-cost
deposit base. But, Chris, you also talked about new coupons; coupons on new production coming down a little bit.
Is it fair to think about a little bit more pressure each quarter on the margin here, or Greg, do you feel like you've
got enough tools in place where you can manage to do some margin stability?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, again, Jon, we really focus on managing net interest income versus...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
...it's really managing the margin, to be honest. But I think you've hit the two primary drivers for us: One is the
coupon on new production. Deposit pricing is important and we saw some room to go there as part of the
program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
But I think the other thing that's really out of our control is just the interest rate environment. What happens to the
shape of the curve over time but we feel that, again, we're very fortunate to have had the protections in place
when we needed them, Jon. So I think that will help us on the NII side, but we're going to stay focused on what
we can control which is loan production and our deposit pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then just one follow-up on the digital spend. I appreciate that the capitalized number, the total
that you shared with us but is the message – you said spending is 2019 and 2020, is the message that the spend
is in the run rate for 2020 and we may see some of this come off in 2021; or is the message that there might be
some incremental spending in 2020 relative to 2019?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think we're still going to see some spend in 2020, with the guidance we provided last quarter was arranged; the
total investment in the $8 million to $10 million range. And my best guess right now is we're probably at the lower
10

end of that investment and with some ability to capitalize, but probably not at the same level we capitalize in 2020.
I'm just throwing out broad concepts here, Jon. But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think when we – at some point in 2020, we're headed very quickly approaching the point where digital spend is
just part of our run rate and where that normalizes it's still, I think, a question because we're always going to want
to keep pace with the digital offerings that are kind of evolving and there's obviously ebbs and flows in that in the
environment. So it's hard to look out and put an iron curtain number or thought in terms of where we start to
normalize and how, but we've always invested in the business. Digital is now part of that investment and we are in
2020, I think, going to hit that point where it's just part of the run rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, [ph] Gordon (00:27:31).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Greg, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question about the security portfolio. It looks like end-of-period balances
were up close to $400 million. And if I back out the premium amortization, the yields were up a good bit. But
based on your earlier answer, it didn't sound like that was part of the security strategy. Did I get that right?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It wasn't really. I mean I think we had stronger deposit growth when you factor out the public funds which really
translated into more of liquidity in the portfolio is the way I'm thinking about it on a net-net basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. And then just thinking about for next quarter, I think deposit growth is a little bit seasonally softer, would you
expect that the size of the securities portfolio to come in from what you're seeing in the end-of-period levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes, if deposits remain flat to coming down a little bit, I would still expect some of the cash coming off the portfolio
just to repay some of the wholesale funding we have out there. But obviously we're staying focused on
maintaining our target on the interest rate strategy is well around $800 million. But I think there's probably some
room to come down to that, but I think it will come down a little, [ph] Gordon (00:28:46) but not a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And then just on the expenses, it looks like there was an FDIC credit this quarter. Do you
have what's remaining to be realized and the timing of when that might come through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory A. Sigrist A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's roughly $1 million left on that credit and we'll be able to tell us -take it when the FDIC tells us we can take it.
It's obviously dependent upon their targeted deposit ratio that they're looking at. And if we're fortunate, it will be in
the first half of 2020 but it's a $1 million level. It's down to a pretty de minimis level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Clint, you touched on M&A earlier, I just want to get a sense you talked in the past about Northern
California. Just geography-wise, is there preference between in footprint or Northern California or maybe any
expansion of geographic focus at this point in time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, in footprint is always easier relative to generating cost-saves, understanding the market dynamics, the
political environment; all of those things that we consider, when we look at the various markets but that doesn't
mean that we would shy away from Northern California or other markets. There's – we've done it for many years.
We continually update this but we've done a pretty broad geographic analysis and identified the opportunities that
are out there.
And when you look at California, I think it's the world's fifth largest economy. Some of the – most of the Northern
California market is very similar to the markets that we're already operating within but there's the local nuances of
local politics and market knowledge and so we're just spending a lot of time learning about that market. And what

we've learned hasn't changed our opinion that we think that there are some opportunities there, but it's more
difficult to go into a new market then do something that's already within our existing footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Then last one, Andy. I was wondering if you could provide some local color on the pause of the Boeing 737
MAX assembly at the Renton factory nearby. What kind of impacts you might see to local economy and whether
you see any kind of growth or credit risk as a result of any exposure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. Well, so far, Boeing's been pretty proactive in retaining the existing workforce in the Renton plant and
they're deploying them up north to Everett and then down south here in the Tacoma/Frederickson area as well as
trying to get folks to go and relocate to Moses Lake where they have 200, 250 planes parked that need
maintenance. And Boeing understands that the labor pool that they have is pretty unique and they don't want to
lose that because when they want to get back into production, they don't want those people to have migrated to
other companies, other industries or other geographies.
Nevertheless, as those employees move to Everett, Frederickson and Moses Lake, it will have an impact on the
Renton area. There'll be a domino effect, in my opinion, on restaurants, dry cleaning, gas stations; those kinds of
activities. We've estimated that our exposure in and around the Renton plant is roughly $55 million, so for us it's a
modest amount and that would include just by simple addresses what the exposure is and that's both consumer,
commercial and commercial real estate.
I think that, nationally, the Boeing situation can impact other communities in a sense larger because of what
happens to the subcontractors, and I referenced the company's spirit that laid off 2,000 people; they make the
fuselage for the 737.
Here, locally, Boeing is trying to retain that employee base and so that's good for us. And then with most of the
local suppliers, they've also created arrangements by which they will either continue to buy parts even though
they're not building planes or they will provide financial support. So we're optimistic that Boeing is doing all the
right things to mitigate any big impacts to our economy, but we are monitoring it closely and we have identified the
potential risks to Columbia.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
So that $55 million would include any local supplier exposure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, the supplier exposure extends beyond just around their written plan. And if you look at our total exposure,
it's about $75 million to $80 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Thank you.

Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So for example, we have a customer in Eugene that is a big supplier to Boeing; and Eugene is a long way from
Renton.

Yes. Thank you.
