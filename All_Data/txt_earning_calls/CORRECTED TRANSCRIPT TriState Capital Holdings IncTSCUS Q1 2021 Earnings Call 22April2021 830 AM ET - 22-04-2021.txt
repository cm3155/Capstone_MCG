James F. Getz
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining us. TriState Capital's first quarter performance underscores the earnings
power and potential of this company, which today operates a $10 billion plus bank and an $11 billion plus asset
management firm. All three of our businesses have been built on our core capabilities and distribution strength to
drive strong demand for our client-focused products and services which are, in turn, delivering continued and
meaningful organic growth.
We, again, delivered record net interest income and total revenue during the quarter, as well as all-time high pre-
tax income, assets under management, loans and deposits. The performance enabled us to grow first quarter
2021 net income by 28% from the linked quarter and 26% over the same period last year. These results were
achieved, thanks to the trust and confidence of our clients which they place in us, and the unrelenting efforts of
our talented investment management, private banking, and commercial banking teams.
Chartwell built on last year's strong performance to deliver a breakout quarter for our asset manager. Clearly, the
markets provided a tailwind, which contributed to Chartwell's strategies performing very well against benchmarks.
At the same time, Chartwell is also differentiated by what we believe is a best-in-class business development and
distribution capability.
In the first quarter of 2021 alone, this business had more than $0.5 billion of net inflows led by Chartwell's short-
duration high-yield product and its high-grade fixed-income product. To continue its momentum, Chartwell started
the second quarter with more than $100 million in unfunded institutional commitments in its pipeline. Together,
business development and investment performance led to assets under management growth of 35% over the last
year to $11.2 billion on March 31, 2021, an all-time high.
First quarter investment management fees of $9 million were up nearly 18% for the same period last year, while
Chartwell's run rate revenue as of March 31, 2021 was nearly $39 million, an increase of 35% from one year prior.
At the same time, Chartwell's first quarter segment net income was up 77% from the same period last year, and
we expect to continue improving asset management's contributions to consolidated earnings as we scale this
business with the talent and infrastructure we have in place today.
Before we turn to our other businesses, I would like Chartwell's CEO, Tim Riddle, to share a few of his thoughts
with you given the standout performance our asset manager had in the first quarter. Tim?

Timothy Joseph Riddle
Managing Partner & Chief Executive Officer, Chartwell Investment Partners LLC
Thank you, Jim. Chartwell's first quarter performance and our optimism about our ability to continue growing
revenues and our contributions to TriState Capital's earnings are based on the strengths of our investment
performance, client relationships, and distribution capabilities. The majority of our $940 million in AUM growth
during the quarter or 54% of it resulted from positive net flows from existing accounts and from new business. So,
while AUM benefited from the market's tailwind in Q1, our ability to generate new business and net flows from
existing client relationships were the primary drivers of AUM growth. We don't believe many active managers will
be able to make that claim.
We also made strategic decisions to enhance Chartwell's operating leverage and segment profitability. These
efforts began well before the onset of the pandemic and continued throughout 2020. As a reminder, by the end of
2019, we had taken active measures which reduced our annual expense run rate by more than $2 million. For the
full year 2020, Chartwell's expenses were down a full $4 million year-over-year.
The efforts we've made to-date have been very successful and we believe positioned us well to deliver profitable
growth at an even greater rate moving forward. In fact, with the team and infrastructure in place today, we believe
we can grow Chartwell's AUM and revenue by another 50% or so. Now, that confidence is supported by the
success of our unparalleled distribution team and by TriState Capital's continued commitment to investing in
distribution.
We're also continuously developing new products and new avenues to deliver those products to our clients and to
prospective clients. As one example, within the past year, we launched collective investment trusts and collective
trust funds, CITs and CTFs resonate with a broader base of prospective clients, particularly in the area of
Outsourced Chief Investment Officer Programs or OCIO, which have become increasingly popular in the
institutional market. And, in fact, CITs and CTFs have had a meaningful impact on our AUM growth, particularly
over the last six months, accounting for approximately $70 million in inflows.
Chartwell is hitting its stride with unique product offerings, credible performance, exceptional talent, and an
enviable distribution capability. We are focused on scaling our business and enhancing profitability and earnings.
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Jim.

Thank you, Tim. Turning to TriState Capital Bank, total loans grew by 23% over last year to $8.5 billion on March
31, 2021. Growth continues to be led by our highly differentiated private banking business. We are the nation's
leading provider of marketable securities backed loans distributed through independent financial advisors, trust
companies, family offices and regional securities firms. And we now have 265 financial intermediaries in our
referral network.
Private banking loans reached a record of $5.1 billion at quarter end and now make up 59% of total loans. And
first quarter private banking loan application volume hit a new record level in 2021, up some 44% from the same
period last year. Commercial loans are up nearly 15% year-over-year as our end-market commercial real estate
lending more than offset pay downs on revolving credit lines and our commercial and industrial portfolio during the
first quarter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
As a reminder, we are coming off record C&I growth in the fourth quarter of $136 million. So, over the last six
months, we've increased commercial and industrial lending by $110 million or 10%. Our commercial real estate
and C&I portfolios remained well diversified with strong pipelines. New CRE and C&I originations in the first
quarter continue to be primarily with our longstanding relationships. This commercial loan growth is truly organic,
high-quality, middle-market growth as we do not offer PPP or any small business products. For example, with
C&I, our single largest borrower category remains financial services and insurance, representing some 32% of
commercial and industrial loans. This includes our investment fund finance offering including call lines of credit
and net asset values of credit, and we see excellent C&I growth opportunities in this industry vertical alone. There
are some periods like the first quarter where there may be timing differences in pay downs of lines based on
capital calls made in prior quarters.
Also of note, many of our financial services company borrowers are members of TriState Capital's intermediary
network offering our private banking loans to their high net worth clients. Our equipment finance offering in our
C&I business also continues to have strong opportunities in the improving economy that we are experiencing.
Considering what the rest of the industry has been reporting for the first quarter so far, we think our commercial
loan growth to-date and our expectations will continue to stand out.
Overall, for full year 2021, we continue to believe our organic total loan growth goal of 15% to 20% remains very
attainable based on the performance achieved in the first quarter and the strong pipelines we have in place today.
Our credit quality continues to be a differentiator among our peers in the industry, benefiting from the large
proportion of private banking loans as well as the quality and the depth of our commercial lending relationships
and our strong fundamental underwriting.
We did increase NPAs by $13 million in the first quarter, though nonperformers represented just 24 basis points of
total assets on March 31. The increase primarily related to two loans to borrowers managing unique situations
related to challenges in commercial real estate markets. We believe we are adequately reserved. Notably, we
have only four nonperformers among thousands of loans in our $8.5 billion portfolio.
With private banking representing some 60% of loans, the quality of our middle-market borrowers, and our credit
talent and underwriting processes, we continue to expect to experience low annual credit costs and superior asset
quality metrics relative to peers.
Loan growth was fully funded by the continued expansion of our liquidity and treasury management offerings.
Record deposits, more than $9.2 billion at quarter-end reflect 19% growth over the last 12 months. Treasury
management deposits, which remain an ongoing and strategic focus, grew by 64% from one year prior.
We've steadily managed deposit costs, which were down by 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and played a
key role in net interest margin expanding by some 6 basis points. Even more important in our view is our success
in consistently growing net interest income dollars across a variety of rate environments since launching the
company back in 2007.
First quarter 2021, NII grew to a record $38.7 million, up nearly 11% over the same period last year. This marks
TriState Capital's 21st consecutive quarter of annual net interest income growth. Continuing to increase NII
dollars through high-quality volume and margin expansion and responsible growth remains one of our goals for
full year 2021.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
NII and non-interest income, excluding securities, gains, and losses combined to generate record quarterly total
revenue in the first three months of 2021. Revenue grew to a record $52.3 million increasing 8.6% over the same
period last year and 4.8% for the linked quarter. Based on the pipelines we mentioned earlier and other
expectations, our full year 2021 revenue growth goal of 15% to 20% remains unchanged.
First quarter operating expenses grew by only 7% from the same period last year. As we continue to invest in our
growth companies, clients, people, infrastructure and technology, our previously disclosed operating expense
growth target remains 10% to 12% for the full year 2021. We've built this company to thrive in all seasons with the
three businesses supporting one another so that we consistently accomplish top- and bottom-line growth at
superior rates over the long-term, while continuously improving operating leverage and increasing earnings for
our shareholders. That's exactly what we achieved in the first quarter of 2021, providing a solid foundation for
what we believe will be a consequential year.
I have with me this morning David Demas, our CFO; Tim Riddle, our CEO at Chartwell; and Brian Fetterolf, the
CEO of TriState Capital Bank to assist with the call.
Operator, would you kindly open the lines?

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I want to start on the net interest margin and appreciate your expectations from here. I think you mentioned last
call that you have to be at that 160 margin by the end of the year, and it looks like we made some good progress
here in the first quarter at the holding company. Would love to hear any updated thoughts around that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Matt, good morning. It's David. As you saw, we were able to deliver on some of the improvement that we talked
about with this group last fall and then again in January in terms of margin expansion. And we see that continuing
to occur in the current rate environment. The expansion is primarily driven by our deposit cost reduction, and
we've made great progress there. We were at 59 basis points on deposit cost on a spot basis at year-end. That
dropped to 48 basis points again on a spot basis at the end of the first quarter. We believe we'll continue to see
improvement in deposit costs and wind the year somewhere in the low 40s on a spot basis.

As you saw, NIM continued to expand from 1.53% at year-end to 1.59% at the end of the first quarter. And with
deposit costs coming down and with our – the floors that we've got in place and what we believe is a benign
interest rate environment, you'll see continued improvement from here. And NIM will be in the mid- to high-160s
by year-end at the holding company and a little bit higher than that at the bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. That's helpful, David. And then, I'm also curious at this point how you're managing the balance
sheet around liquidity and securities. I think, on an average basis, we saw liquidity move down, securities move
up. Would love to understand kind of how you're thinking about that as you move through the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Well, I think just on real quick – this is Brian. I think we're doing a really good job of highlighting the structural,
really the structural alignment of the funding mechanism and then the asset deployment aspects of the company.
So, last year, obviously, you have seen a lot happen within the – within the funding base and not only responding
to what we thought we wanted in liquidity, but also responding to our best clients and making sure that we had
room and capacity for them. And so, we've been able to, through a lot of communication, sales management, and
prioritization, make sure that we're really aligning our sort of what we would call it agile funding mechanism with
our ability to do that. So, that predictability, I think, allows us to make some better use or more efficient use of the
balance sheet. So, David, if you want to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. So, we've, Matt, been focused on bringing cash balances down and deploying the liquidity we had and built
last year into longer-term higher-returning assets, right? So, we've built a fair amount of liquidity in the investment
portfolio which is high grade, AA, agency, US government securities that are fully pledgeable at the Fed and
creates a lot of liquidity for us. And so, we've moved it from cash to other parts of the balance sheet, but we'll
continue to focus on the liquidity of the overall balance sheet as we move through the year.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning Jim. Maybe we talk about deposit growth, just quickly, very strong in the quarter. You touched on
in the release, the drivers there with the liquidity management business. But maybe you can give a little more
detail there about what's driving that strong deposit growth and then expectations going forward? Obviously,
including the environment with – as you just touched on excess liquidity and everything else? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. Yes. So, thanks. So, yeah, we are, I think, pretty pleased with the first quarter. And if you look at fourth
quarter last year and first quarter of this year, if you put them together, our six-month time period, we think are
pretty representative of what we want to be doing and sort of, yeah, as we approach this more stable
environment. But – and that -- I would guess we would classify that as meaningful growth, meaningful clients, and
meaningful business. So, pretty diversified across the platform, actually, in those two quarters.
Treasury management was – so our service based offerings that drive liquidity balances were a very significant
driver of the deposit growth within the first quarter from a balanced perspective and some new relationships which
are – we're pretty excited about and that our national sales business and the family office business, both
contributing in smaller account sizes, but with more names. So, we're trying to really grow our relationships at this
time and then sort of build for the future, if you will, and taking advantage of that.
But, if you look, our overall expectations will be our service-based offerings will be somewhere in the range of
40% to 50% of our deposit growth this year. So, we did see probably a little bit more on the service-based
originations in the first quarter. But, if you look at fourth quarter, first quarter, I think that's a pretty good balance
there, 40% to 50% on the TM and the service-based side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Dan, this is Jim. What you're asking really falls in line with the whole nature of this company from time of
inception. We've wanted to be consistently reducing the risk profile. So, at this point, as you heard earlier, we're
close to about at 60% of our loans being loans secured by marketable securities. They are actually priced every
single day and valued. So, we have a good understanding of what the nature of the collateral is in 60% of that
portfolio. But, more importantly, this situation where we've been able to garnish deposits, we've taken advantage
of to build up the investment portfolio, which continues to lower the risk profile. If you look back a couple of
quarters, you'll see, we took a very meaningful gain in that portfolio of some $3.8 million and took it out of
corporates and put it into agencies. And that's what we've been consistently doing. And, as David pointed out, we
have an average rating of AA+, but we also have a short duration on that of 4.3 years. So, we're really been able
to create an appropriate environment for the type of circumstances that we find ourselves in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Terrific. That's great color. Thanks. And then maybe switching over to Chartwell, so you've had some nice
expansion of EBITDA margins over the last few quarters, you had just mentioned the 50% AUM and revenue
growth. Maybe, do you think you can continue to see EBITDA margins expand in that business? And then if you
can touch on the timing of the 50% growth expectations within that business? Thanks.

Timothy Joseph Riddle A
Managing Partner & Chief Executive Officer, Chartwell Investment Partners LLC
Sure. This is Tim. In terms of the EBITDA margin, we would expect that to expand from here. We've obviously put
a great deal of time and effort in on, again, controlling the expenses across the board within Chartwell. And,
again, with our success and continued success in, again, new business and inflows from existing accounts, that
naturally will expand that EBITDA margin as time goes by.
In terms of the growing of the AUM and the revenues by 50% from here, again, that – we could accomplish that
task, if, in fact, the market cooperates, and we continue to expand again new product offerings. And as I had
indicated, also opening up new areas where we can distribute those products. But that could happen over the
course of the next, say, three to perhaps five years.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Let me – bigger picture question to start. You could just give us an update on sort of where the financial
intermediary network stands today. And just curious how that's trended over the past year, trying to get a sense
for, you know, has the pandemic slowed the growth rate of onboarding new relationships and as the economy
reopens and people travel again, does that provide a bigger runway to bring more folks on board, just appreciate
some general thoughts there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. Yes, thanks, Russell. I think overall, yeah, we're continuing to increase that number to the mid [ph] $260
million (00:28:22) range. And certainly, we're very pleased with that type of growth. It's one of our actually larger
growth quarters. Our applications are -- did hit a record number. We're up 44% year-over-year same quarter. And
so, we are seeing, I would say, continued success from our distribution platform and as well as just increased

awareness and demand and acceptance around what we're doing here. So, it's probably unprecedented in terms
of our – the opportunity that we have. And, I guess, accordingly, we're really focusing on our meaningful business
making sure that we're there for our most meaningful clients and making sure that sort of our – yeah, the additions
to the platform or relationships that we know we can serve really well at a premier level. But, overall, to your point,
we're seeing, I would say, unprecedented opportunity within the channel.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate it, Brian. Thank you for the update. And then switching gears a little bit, you guys gave some good
color on the C&I dynamics this quarter. Just looking for a general update on the equipment finance vertical
expectations for growth there going forward? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. So, I mean, I think we're very happy with, again, both the private bank production in the first
quarter, again, when you put fourth quarter and first quarter together, record production and again, same thing on
our commercial side, right? So overall, I guess our distribution capabilities, our internal ability to meet client
expectations and be there for our clients, I would say, again, that is in a historic high level right now.
On the commercial side, as we pointed out, I think in the release, if you look at the fourth quarter, first quarter,
we're pretty happy with $100 million-plus growth on just, again, we're talking the C&I side. So, we're happy with
that. We did increase our equipment finance and the fund finance verticals of centers of excellence to make sure
that we were – had opportunities with good clients sort of in all environments. And those are more agile products
that did well last year from a growth perspective.
And in the first quarter period, a bit of normalization around that fourth quarter into the first quarter. But as we look
forward, we're very positive on growth of both of those businesses. And I think as we get into the recovery
economy, we're very excited about our prospects within traditional C&I. So we've, again, focused a bit on that
fund finance, equipment finance space in the last 12 months to 24 months. And as we move forward from here,
we know that those are working really well and we're really excited what we think we can do in traditional C&I.
And again, this is the time when we really stand out to people, which is, we'll have to be more thoughtful when
you're originating new C&I relationships. That's what we're the best at. That's what our people are the best at. So,
we're excited about how we're going to differentiate ourselves sort of over the next 12 months to 24 months. And
again, we think that as the market opens a little bit as you were talking about just our ability to meet with people a
little bit more and convey that in person, not just over the phone or by video, will help our distribution efforts,
getting that message really felt by clients and prospects.

Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
So, I wanted to start out on credit here. The NPA has picked up, $13 million of that was for the two CRE loans. I'm
sort of curious, could we see any build in reserves moving forward from here due to that or I'm also sort of curious
what the time line is to get some of these loans off of deferrals? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, if I understand, I think, maybe two questions in terms of the NPAs and provision and then the deferral
trajectory from here. So, I think on the provisions, we feel that we're adequately reserved or well-reserved at this
point, and we don't see any trends that are referenced by those, as we indicated, those are unique circumstances.
So, we'll see anything that those NPAs will really reflect on the broader portfolio. And I'll let David give some
further guidance.
But on the deferral basis, as we indicated, were eight loans, $62 million. We're scheduled to reduce that pretty
significantly again here over the next one to two quarters. So, we're really happy and pleased, I guess, and
inspired, if you will, by the performance of the loans that we had in the deferral portfolio. So, again, the quality of
people we work with just really on demonstration here as those people manage their businesses and properties
through that.
But, David, if you wanted to give more guidance on provision, I guess?

David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to, Brian. So, we're very pleased with the investments we've made in talent and our
credit culture, and it continues to pay dividends. We believe that those investments will keep our annual credit
costs well below our peer group. Brian has talked about the fact that we haven't seen any notable trends here.
And while we remain comfortable with our reserve levels and our credit book, CECL is a bit unique, and the future
volatility of CECL with any potential macroeconomic issues that may emerge in the short – in the medium term is
in terms of dealing with the pandemic. We're in sort of a transitionary period. And factors such as losses across
the entire banking sector as loans come off deferral need and a repayment status, things that are macroeconomic
variables like commercial real estate, price indexes, vacancy rates, and the underlying weaknesses mask or
cloak, some of the – that are [ph] cloaked (00:35:18) by current fiscal policy. You also have potential tax policy in
here, right? So, there's just a lot going on in with respect to what the CECL model needs to absorb and process.
And so, we feel good about where we are right now. We don't see any further losses emerging, but we're going to
be very cautious and prudent before we release any reserves at this point.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Q
Okay. Got you. Yeah, that's super helpful. And just on – it seems like you guys are putting a lot more money into
investment securities here. Sort of curious, looking forward, are you guys looking to continue that trend? And also,
what are the current yields looking like on the investment securities? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, the current investment portfolio is, as Jim mentioned, AA+ rated, average duration of about 4.3 years. Agency
securities that are seeing some repayments now, but those repayments will slow. And the overall yield will
continue to improve. We're probably somewhere around the 1.70%, 1.75% overall yield of the portfolio at the
moment. I expect that to pick up a little bit as prepayments slow here over the course of the next few months.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good to have you all on this morning. I had a question for Tim. I appreciate you being on today and giving us the
update on Chartwell. I was wondering if you could maybe expand a little bit on your expectations for the – your
kind of weighted average fee rate going forward? It looked like it took a very modest step down in the quarter. Is
that through the mix and some of the trust AUM growth you were talking about or is that just a timing issue on
revenue recognition? Just any expanded thoughts there that you're willing to share.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Timothy Joseph Riddle A
Managing Partner & Chief Executive Officer, Chartwell Investment Partners LLC
It is all about the mix. So, when you take a look at where we had a lot of success in Q1 in terms of not only flows
but also in terms of new business, a lot of that was on the fixed income side, slightly lower fee, obviously. So,
that's what drives that average fee rate that, again, might move around 1 basis point or 2 basis points, given the
flow and the mix of the new business through the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Mike, you want to keep in mind, this is Jim, that when we acquired Chartwell in 2014, the average weighted fee
was 25 basis points and now it's 35%. You're aware we had put in place a family of mutual funds and the yield on
those mutual funds to the company is higher. And that, to an extent, drove that business. And if you look at the
portfolio itself, it was overwhelmingly when we acquired an institutional business. It's much more competitive.
Now, over 20% of it is retail. So that – what that 35% is probably going to be a pretty solid number, it will rotate
between [ph] 33% and 36% or 37% (00:38:55), but it's not going to get much better than that. And the portfolio,
the whole portfolio, the AUM has been diversified meaningfully. If you look at it, now it's about 57% fixed income,
while before, it was probably not much more than 15% when we bought the company. And in environments that
you find that you experience like we have last year, it added stability to the company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Makes sense. Thank you, guys, for that. And then as my follow-up, maybe a question for David, I apologize if I
missed this earlier in the call, but I feel like the last couple quarters here, I've been [ph] throwing (00:39:44) darts
at the board on this FDIC insurance expense. I was just wondering if you have any clarity in kind of where that –
when and where that might settle into a more normalized run rate moving forward here, especially with the strong
deposit growth that you guys are continuing to see?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Sure, Mike. So, let me put some context to it. The FDIC insurance expense was, on an annualized basis, 4 basis
points on average assets in the first quarter. That's down from about 8 basis points in the fourth and down from
about 13 basis points in the third of last year. I think we have shared with [ph] this group (00:40:21) previously that
because we've crested over the $10 billion mark, the methodology in terms of calculating that, that insurance
premium is different, and we get the benefit of our private banking loan portfolio, the lower risk nature of that
portfolio in terms of the calculation.
So you will see the insurance premiums tick up slightly from here based on growth. But where we sit right now is
probably a pretty good run rate of where we'll go through the year, obviously, adjusting a little bit for growth. But
that that moved from the third quarter to the fourth when we were able to apply it for the first time. And then to the
first, most of that transition is now behind us, and this will start to normalize from here.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. So, we're growing off of kind of the $1.1 million [ph] in excess (00:41:17), the new methodology makes the
back half of the last year a little less relevant from a calculation standpoint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Exactly.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Matt Olney from Stephens. Please go
ahead with your follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just want to circle back on the expense discussion we were just having
and just taking a step back. Operating expenses were sequentially low in the first quarter and you mentioned
FDIC insurance is one of the reasons. The guidance of 10% to 12% growth in 2021 was maintained and implies
quite a bit of ramp from these levels in the first quarter. We'd love to hear more about kind of where you'd expect
to see that ramp in which categories? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, Matt, we – you think about our growth last year and our ability to manage expenses to about 10%, we were
able to continue to make significant investments last year as we built technology, people, processes, regulatory
compliance, all to support what we view as responsible growth by the organization. For this year, our goals
continue to be annual growth of loans and deposits of 15% to 20% and revenue of 15% to 20%.
To support that responsible growth, we need to continue to make investments in people, process, and technology.
So, that's where you'll see the primary drivers being in compensation and technology-related expenses. We
believe we can focus on driving that -- those continued investments and keeping expense growth under 12%.
You'll naturally see as we move through the year, improvements in operating leverage, operating efficiency ratio,
the noninterest expense to average assets ratio and return on equity, which is above 9 times for the quarter, and
we believe we'll get that to double digits by the end of the year. So responsible growth, a lot of investments we're
14

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
making in people and technology to support that growth, regulatory compliance-related type items and we feel
good about the projection that Jim had in his remarks of 10% to 12%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. And I would just add, around the client engagement, client experience piece, a lot of those are aligned with
the risk management side, but a lot of the people and automation and technology that we're putting in place will
absolutely enhance the client experience. So, we'll reduce manual touches to more automated touches. So, we're
freeing up our people to focus on higher level of client engagement and more meaningful engagement. And also,
as you can see, sort of our T&E and other client engagement expenses fairly low in the quarter. Our hope
certainly is that we're finding ways to continue to engage with clients in person or more meaningfully over the
future. So, we'll certainly see some increases as we do that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And just a few more housekeeping questions here, I guess, more on the modeling front. It
looks like in the first quarter, the diluted share count was a little bit lower than expected, but at a higher preferred
dividend. David, I think we kind of talked about this a few months. Could you just kind of remind me of the puts
and takes on that in the first quarter and how we should be thinking about that moving forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, Matt, as a recovering accountant, I sometimes find there's an inverse relationship between the amount of
disclosure and its usefulness. We will continue to provide this table on page 14 to you each quarter. Diluted
common shares are about 32.2 million shares, that should stay relatively stable. The biggest change this quarter
was the share count of restricted stock, the amount which was dilutive. That fluctuates with the market price and
how much -- what shares are in the money. With the improvement in the TriState market price, the restricted
stock, more shares became dilutive.
And so, absent any significant change in terms of restricted stock, for the remainder of the year, the diluted
common share count should stay around 32.2 million, maybe a little higher or lower, just based on market
fluctuations. So, we'll continue to provide this disclosure and continue to try to provide transparency and clarity
here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And on the preferred dividend side, I think it's around $5 million this quarter. How will that fluctuate throughout the
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
That will stay relatively consistent as well. It will grow slightly quarter-to-quarter to the extent that Stone Point
elects to receive the dividend in additional shares versus cash. To date, they have done that. They've elected
additional shares. But the overall dividend should stay relatively stable at the first quarter levels.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just lastly, David, on the effective tax rate. I would love to know kind of how you're thinking about
that this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, we're a little higher than we had hoped to be in the first quarter, but we still believe we can get that down to
17%, 18% through the year. We've got a couple of credits on the horizon that potentially will help us get there if
we're able to execute and transact on those guides. And so guidance of 17% to 18% still holds.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
