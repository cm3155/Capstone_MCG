Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, all, for joining us. As anticipated, the market environment in
aggregate, remained mixed, continuing a pattern we've seen over the past several quarters. Notwithstanding the

net result for Morgan Stanley was we generated a little over $13 billion in revenues, $2.3 billion in net income, and
ROTCE of 13.5%.
Concerns around the tight employment market, high commodity prices, inflationary pressures that may impact
Fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter, but we are seeing increasing evidence of M&A and
underwriting calendars that are building, and while we expect momentum to continue this year, given the fourth
quarter has some seasonal considerations, we expect most of the activity to materialize in 2024. Meanwhile, it's
our job to control what we can control.
Firstly, we successfully completed the E*TRADE integration this quarter. That was a massive undertaking and the
expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the P&L for a couple of years and involved us migrating 14
million accounts onto our platform, and honestly, it went incredibly well. Really, a seamless performance by the
team. This conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy, building revenue synergies across channels
and attracting clients to our best-in-class advice offering.
Secondly, on the capital front, we bought back $1.5 billion in stock. We averaged a nearly 4% dividend yield over
the quarter, and at the same time, delivered a CET1 ratio at 15.5% which is 260 basis points over our most recent
regulatory requirement. We clearly have a significant capital buffer. Also, you saw the full details of the initial
Basel III endgame proposal. As you all know, this is a proposal, not the final regulation. I'm going to repeat that.
It's a proposal. There is an enormous amount of energy being spent, conversations being had across industry
groups and agency board members, and I've been deeply involved, myself along with Sharon Yeshaya. And
we've been told many times that the Federal Reserve strongly welcomes comments on this proposal. Given this, I
anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before it's adopted as a final rule.
Let me be crystal clear. Because of the buffers we have built, even if this proposal were implemented today as
written, we have adequate capital to the meet the ultimate requirement. Needless to say, there're many years
between now and then. In the quarter, Wealth Management generated net new assets of $36 billion. That's
obviously below recent quarters. It's consistent with what I've been saying for a long time. These numbers will
bounce around; and in any quarterly period, there're always idiosyncratic things. This year, we've had two
quarters where we had some surprise on the upside, and in aggregate for the year, we're totaling net new assets
of $235 billion year-to-date. Our annualized growth rate is at the high end of the 5% to 7% range that we've been
looking at and it's consistent. In fact, it's spot-on with our three-year target of $1 trillion for net new money.
Overall, this firm is in excellent shape notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves
in. My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean a slate as possible and deal with a few
of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months. I'm very excited about the future of this firm, its leadership,
its strategy and its culture.
And I'll now turn it over to Sharon who can discuss the quarter in greater detail. And then together as always we'll
take your questions. Thank you.

Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $13.3 billion in the quarter. Our EPS was $1.38,
and our ROTCE was 13.5%. Results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop. The Firm's
year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. Together, severance and DCP impacted the year-to-date efficiency ratio by
nearly 150 basis points. As we invest for growth, our integration efforts have remained a priority. Integration-

related expenses were $68 million in the third quarter and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter, as
previously communicated.
Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.7 billion, declining 3% versus the prior year.
Equity and Fixed Income results were in line with long-term historical averages. Investment Banking revenues
remained depressed on lower volume. However, leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progressed
positively evidenced by a notable increase of Morgan Stanley's announced volumes in the third quarter on a year-
over-year basis.
Investment Banking revenues decreased to $938 million. The change to the previous year was driven by lower
results in advisory and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues of $449 million reflected a decline in completed
transactions due to lower announced volumes in prior periods. Despite the weaker quarterly results, we continue
to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern.
Equity underwriting revenues were $237 million. Overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages.
While increased confidence supported early September issuances, a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve and
resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains window-driven. Fixed Income
underwriting revenues were $252 million, down versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower non-investment
grade events. We are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bake-off activity across sectors and
geographies. The pickup in our announced M&A volumes in the third quarter speaks to the trends we've observed
at the end of the last quarter, but the landscape continues to evolve. As we look ahead, corporate confidence will
largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs. While risks remain
including geopolitical threats, the underlying trends suggest activity is building and there is a desire among clients
to pursue their long-term strategic objectives.
Equity revenues were $2.5 billion. The business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in
Europe and Asia. Prime brokerage revenues were solid. Client balances were modestly higher compared to last
year. The results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances. Cash revenues declined
versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes. Derivative results increased year-over-year; reflecting
higher client activity with particular strength in Europe.
Fixed Income revenues were $1.9 billion. Micro results increased versus the prior year, supported by strength in
securitized products both in agency and non-agency trading. Macro revenues decreased versus last year's
elevated results with lower revenues in rates and foreign exchange. Results reflect lower client conviction
particularly around the future of central bank policy. Commodity revenues increased year-over-year on the back of
a constructive trading environment, particularly for oil. Other revenues of $277 million improved versus last year
driven by lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans net of loan hedges and higher net interest income and
fees.
Turning to ISG lending and provisions. The allowance for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments
increased slightly to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $93 million. The increase was driven by a
continued negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector. Net charge-offs were $39 million, primarily
related to one commercial real estate loan in the office sector.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues of $6.4 billion were strong and increased from the prior year. The
growth of Asset Management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income, underscoring
their durability. As designed, our asset-led strategy drives steady fee-based flows that support Asset Management
revenues. With this in mind, we remain focused on asset migration into our advisor-led channel. This quarter, our

long-term strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our E*TRADE
integration, successfully converting nearly $900 billion of client AUM onto the Morgan Stanley platform. This will
continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisors and seamlessly transition them into advice-based
relationships.
Moving onto the business metrics in the third quarter. Pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was
26.7%. Integration expense as well as DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 150 basis points.
Net new assets were $36 billion; bringing year-to-date NNA to $235 billion, which represents over 7% annualized
growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net
recruiting into the advisor-led channel. The multiyear buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our
advisor-led channel, evidenced by fee-based flows of $22.5 billion in the third quarter alone.
Asset Management revenues of $3.6 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Higher average assets and the impact
of cumulative positive fee-based flows over the past year drove the increase. Transactional revenues excluding
DCP were $820 million, up 7% year-over-year. Results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail
clients into alternatives, particularly into private equity and private credit. Bank lending balances were roughly flat
versus the prior quarter. Growth in mortgages and tailored lending offset pay-downs in securities-based lending.
Total deposits of $340 billion remained stable compared to the prior quarter. Still the deposit mix has shifted as
clients continue to allocate rate sensitive cash to higher yielding cash alternatives available on the platform,
including our expanded savings offering. In addition, the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into
equity markets from sweep balances, ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment.
Net interest income was $2 billion. The sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix. Looking
towards the rest of this year, based on where we exited the quarter, we expect NII to trend lower. The magnitude
will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates. Wealth Management business model is focused on
steady asset aggregation, delivering strong solutions and advice to clients, while growing durable fees and
expanding margin through the cycle. We are continuing to invest in our industry-leading position and the
sustainability of our long-term growth. As the backdrop recovers, advisors remain well-positioned to capture
greater asset opportunity, supported by our multichannel model that was built to attract new client relationships.
Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion increased 14% compared to the prior year,
supported by higher Asset Management revenues. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of
approximately $7 billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our MSIM active equity growth strategies,
which continue to see redemptions consistent with the industry. Excluding these segment's outflows, year-to-date
long-term flows across the franchise were slightly positive. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see
demand for Parametric customized portfolios across both equity and Fixed Income strategies, a partial offset to
the headwinds of the quarter.
Liquidity and overlay services had net flows of $5.7 billion driven by demand for Parametric institutional portfolio
overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies. Specific to Parametric, and across the entire franchise, overlay and
long-term net flows in the quarter were almost $7 billion; underscoring strong trends in this business. Asset
Management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year on higher average AUM. Performance
based income and other revenues were $24 million, supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light
platform. Results were driven by gains in US private equity, offset by weakness in Asia private equity and real
estate. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place.
Ongoing investments in our businesses including our market-leading Parametric franchise, as well as our
continued growth in innovation in private markets, position us well to best serve our clients.

Turning to the balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio stands at 15.5%, roughly flat versus last quarter. Standardized
RWAs declined sequentially to $445 billion, reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market
movements at the end of the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our
shareholders, buying back $1.5 billion of common stock during the quarter.
Taken in the context of the mixed environment, we are pleased with the firm's resiliency and our competitive
positioning. As clients gain more conviction, we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities,
particularly in Investment Banking. This increased client conviction will also further support asset growth in Wealth
and Investment Management. We will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies; all
while prudently managing our capital profile.
With that, we will now open the line up to questions.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning, James and Sharon. I wanted to just touch on Wealth Management. A bit of a longer-term question
here. As you mentioned, you've enjoyed really strong organic growth in that segment over the last few years, but
it doesn't appear to be translating to revenue growth. If I look at the Wealth Management revenues excluding NII,
it hasn't really grown in three years despite gathering significant amount of assets. So, curious how you're thinking
about the flow-through from AUM or asset growth to revenues. And then maybe more broadly, how are you
thinking about the unit economics of your asset gathering strategy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Actually, I think that interestingly enough Christian, I'm pretty impressed with the resiliency that we've seen
in the business. This is literally the explanation of the funnel that we've talked about. If you look back over the
course of the last year alone, $235 billion of assets that we've captured. Then look at the fee-based flows, right.
We continue to see increased fee-based flows. This past year, if you exclude the asset acquisitions that we had
over the last couple of years, we are basically at some of the historical highs of seeing fee-based growth as we
move forward. You're looking at times since COVID where we obviously had very high retail engagement, and
you've been able to offset, even with a decline in NII, offset those growth to asset base, Asset Management
revenues as you move forward. It's that, that we are trying to grow. We're trying to continue to grow our Asset
Management fees over time and make sure that we have the right solutions in place to offer our clients.
Now, let's take that forward. We have this mixed environment. You've 23% of our retail client assets sitting in
cash. That is 5% higher, right, from the 18% on historical averages. We've begun to see retail investors put their
cash into markets. The last four months consecutively, we've seen that movement into the market. This quarter
alone, we began to see alternative growth in the new products, the growth in transactional revenues. We haven't
seen that since the first quarter of 2022 before you started this rate hike cycle. So, in my mind actually, the
strategy is working pretty darn well especially if you think about how we've been able to aggregate assets, migrate

them into fee-based flows, look at transactional and see that grow, and see growth in these new products and
deliver them to our clients, all while these clients have dry powder to invest as these markets turn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Thanks, Sharon. Maybe my follow-up is just thinking about your ROTCE targets over time of 20%. The
quarter was fine. 14% is nothing to sniff at, but it is some ways off that 20%. How should we think about the
bridge from here? I know you've mentioned Investment Banking, but it's like a fairly small part of your business.
So what's the bridge to 20%? How much of it is macro, how much of it is self-help? And for what is macro, what
sort of operating backdrop are you looking for? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Christian, maybe I'd take that, given Sharon just pummeled you and I want to give you a little bit of a break here.
By the way, the only thing I'd add to what Sharon said is when people have a choice of making 4%, 5% return by
doing nothing, they're not going to be trading in the markets. So, the actual secondary lines in the revenues are
the lowest I've seen for years in the last couple years. As rates do eventually come down, they will come down. I
don't think next year, but they'll come down after that. You'll see more activity in that regard and naturally you'll
see more money go up in the sweep.
So interestingly, there's kind of an optimal point where rates are attractive for investors, but not so high they keep
them out of the market, and not so high that there isn't money kept on sweep. So, very different from the checking
account phenomena you see at some of the commercial banks. But back to the 20%, I mean I'd just say, as you
know we actually, we were at 20%. So it's not – this is not a – this would not be a remarkable achievement. Like
when I first came to Morgan Stanley and people asked me if the Wealth Management business could generate, in
those days, 15% margins? And I said, well, there are two people already doing it. So it's pretty obvious it can be
done. So we've done it, and nothing structurally has changed. If anything, the Firm's got stronger. We've been
investing a lot.
I mean, this E*TRADE deal was, there was a lot of investment to get that integration done. We decided to keep
investing through the cycle on the funnel in Wealth because we think over the next 10 years that's going to pay
monster dividends. The integration across all the Eaton Vance platforms, they were never really integrated as one
platforms across the different [indiscernible] (00:22:53) Parametric and Eaton Vance and now sorting through all
of that, which Dan has done a great job of doing. And then frankly, banking has been really weak. I mean, under
$1 billion is evidence of a very weak calendar and very weak M&A, and the pipeline we saw this quarter was
really strong. So, I don't think the announcements won't translate into revenues in Q4, but they will in Q1, Q2 next
year.
So just on the math, I think if we're running about $2.2 billion, we'd have to generate about another $700 million
net a quarter, just on the expense management. We could do things on expenses easily more than we've done.
And if you get a couple hundred million from that and then on the revenue side, as banking recovers some of the
transaction stuff we're just talking about and Sharon pointed out, of these assets moving to annuitized product,
and then I think Fed will move up from this point. You'd pretty easily get to the 20%. So, I appreciate the question.
And I'm not concerned about that long-term outlook. I think it has happened and will happen again and frankly
won't be that long.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. So first one on Wealth Management and then NII. I mean, the trends I think were in the range of
what's been happening across the industry, so not overly surprising, but I'm curious if you could break down even
qualitatively how much of that a sweep movement is coming in historical Morgan Stanley versus E*TRADE? I'm
just trying to see what type of client is moving.
And then to go back, you peaked my interest, James, in the comment you just made about not next year but
maybe after that. What conditions do you think we need for Wealth Management and NII to stable and grow?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So let's take the first question, which is the two different types of deposit mix. You're right. If you think about the
self-directed client versus a advisory-based client that we've had in the historical Wealth Management franchise,
one has proven to be somewhat of a stickier deposit base than you would see on the Wealth Management side,
and I think what I would say is the traditional Wealth Management side that we had historically had. So that does
provide you with a sense of what's going on in terms of which client base is seeing that.
On the potential growth of NII going forward, again, that's part of the same asset gathering strategy. Some
proportion of these assets as they come over, be that into the self-directed or the advice-based relationship, will
be held in some sort of transactional cash. So that will be supportive over time of NII to some degree from a
deposit perspective, but that also provides us with lending capabilities and opportunities.
As you know, Glenn, we've seen tremendous, what we would call, sort of household penetration in being able to
offer new lending products to our various client bases. Obviously, with the SBL product, we continue to see
mortgages and growth in mortgages even in this rate environment for new purchases in homes. As we better
understand our client base, we're able to do that more, and actually bringing together this E*TRADE acquisition,
putting everything on the same portfolio and the same franchise from a technology perspective, is foundational in
being able to integrate all of those bank relationships. And what we used to call the bank rails that E*TRADE had
for a broader wealth offering that should also help support NII as we look into the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think, I don't know – on the second bit, I just think there's an optimal point. I mean, we went from zero rates to
5% in effectively the fastest period since the 1960s, early 1970s, fastest rate increase. What's remarkable is we
haven't had a recession, by the way, and I personally don't think we're going to, but with that, I mean if you're an
adviser and you've got a client sitting on a lot of cash earning zero, I would hope you're telling them to put it in
treasuries or something. So that's exactly what's happened. At around 2% to 3%, it becomes a different kind of
discussion.
So, I think there's a trigger point, and you're seeing it across, as you said, the whole industry. And that's why
you're seeing a different behavior set for people in checking accounts. So they haven't gotten advised. They
money is sitting in the checking account. If they're not paying attention, they're still getting, I don't know, 20 basis
points or something. So, as rates come down, the total cash we have in the book, which is 23% will be coming
down anyway because that's an abnormality related to where rates are right now. As rates come down over the
next couple of years, you're actually going to see people much less price sensitive on what they're generating in a
return on the cash and just using it as a liquidity account to manage investments going in and out.

So I think in some ways we overachieved relative to our particular business mix. So I'm quite encouraged about
the future because of that. I think, in fact, you're hearing some of that language coming out of the banks when
they said, I forget what words some of the other CEOs said, but it was effectively the same. They've overachieved
and that it's sitting in checking accounts, and they're making enormous amount of money on that, but that's
unsustainable. We've overachieved and the rates are so high. Everybody want to be in cash earning, not cash
sitting dormant. I don't know if that makes sense to you, Glenn. By the way, I have to say, I did love your comment
about, for all the talk about green shoots, somebody forgot to water them. I'd give you that one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That's better than a pummel. Thank you. One quick one. Maybe I'll get the pummel on this one. I know it's the
board decision, but so long as the CEO transition announcement takes place, is there any timeframe where it
starts to put more strain on the organization or become a distraction, as every reporter in the world is writing on it
every day?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. About three years from now. No. Listen, Glenn; come on. We've said, I would not be CEO. I said at the
annual meeting I wouldn't be CEO within a year and I said that for a very simple reason that people didn't believe
that I was going to leave, because apparently bank CEOs don't, and I said I would. And when I say I'm going to
do something, I'm definitely going to do it. I would leave at the earliest possible moment that the board feels
comfortable making that decision, and I made that very clear to them. I think they've done a terrific job. Now that
you've opened up the question, I'll answer it more broadly. They've done a terrific job, Dennis Nally and the
succession committee, and Tom Glocer, Lead Director on the board; all the directors engaged, really thorough
process. And where, I don't want to give an exact time because that's sort of a spoiler.
I already did that apparently talking about Logan Roy once, shall I say, we're well in. And I do believe there are
diminishing returns at some point in time. We're not there. The team is doing great. The businesses are moving
forward, but yeah I want to get out of the seat and give somebody else a chance to see what they can do with it,
and I think there's a lot of things, the growth opportunities in this company. Now that we've set it up with so many
planks that are solid, you have an abundance of choices.
And I just look at what we've done with MUFG in Japan, the so-called 2.0 that Ted has been driving with Hiro, the
CEO of MUFG, of taking our Japanese business with them to a completely different level. And I think there's a lot
of things we can do with them in Japan strategically, taking advantage of the turnaround of the Japanese
economy. That's just one example. So, yes, we're getting close. I'm certainly not a barrier to it. I'm an, I don't know
if the word's enabler, but I'd like to get on with it and I'll help in the transition as Executive Chairman for a bit and
this place will go forth and thrive.

Hey, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on something you said, James, around the optimal level of
rates. And you talked about NII, but if the Fed were to hike a few more times or if rates stay at these levels for
longer, is there an argument to be made that just structurally the business will be challenged until we get to the
9

other side of the rate cycle, given just client assets probably remain in lower spread products? Just talk to us in
terms of how you think about, if rates don't get cut, is that a headwind to the business until we get to the other
side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
No. I definitely don't think there's structural issue. I mean, my goodness, the business is generating, I'm talking
about Wealth, 26% margins with the various costs in there, and I think it's 28%, Sharon, without them. If you tell
me few years ago, I mean, I thought we'd get to 28%, but pretty much nobody else in the world did. So, no.
There's no structural issue here. I'm just saying and I do think if at the risk of making a prediction, I suspect the
Fed will do one more rate increase at some by the end of the year, I guess, November but that's likely to be it.
And I do not expect the Fed to cut rates in 2024, but I do expect going forward after that.
So given that, we're talking about 12 months. The cash is largely moved, that's moved. On the margin, you're
going to have a little bit of NII impact over the next 12 months, but that's really not the real game. The real game
is go-forward after that. And the minute you see the Fed indicate they've stopped raising rates, the M&A and
underwriting calendar will explode because there is enormous pent up activity. The boards of directors are sitting
there saying, until we understand the cost of financing, it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital
transactions. So I think you're heading into, and unfortunately I'm not going to be around to enjoy it, but you're
heading into a really good patch here. And I don't know if it's six months out or nine months out or it starts three
months out, but this thing is going to start turning. And then rates will be the kicker, when they start coming down.
And as I said, people will be less focused on cash and accounts and more focused on investment opportunities.
That's when you're going to see the double kicker.

But a separate question, I think Sharon, you mentioned about focus on secular growth, I think international
expansion. E*TRADE's done now. I'm assuming you're not doing any big M&A any time soon. Just talk to us
about international expansion. A lot of disruption on Wealth Management, private banking globally. What the
opportunities are, where we're investing. Would love some color around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Investing more broadly internationally. James mentioned the deals or what we've been working on, I'd say, MUFG
2.0 between research and also our sales and trading side. We continue to look for opportunities. We have Arun
Kohli who's been has been working on our India franchise. I think that there are clearly opportunities there within
India. We see a lot of opportunities throughout Asia. We've discussed different opportunities also all across the
international franchise in Europe. So when you think about Investment Management, that was one of the key
points that we had talked about potential distribution of Investment Management, Eaton Vance products all over
10

Europe. We've seen that. We continue to see products with Calvert, with various active ETFs that we're seeing all
across Europe again and we've been raising new AUM there.
So there are ways to distribute product across different geographies. There's a way to work with our strategic
partners in places like Japan. There're ways to organically take advantage and move forward in places of growth
that have more secular growth trends, such as India. So there are tremendous opportunities where we see that
we can take, like I said, product, client relationship, and also work across Institutional Securities and various
places in Investment Management. Dan Simkowitz has talked a lot about that, raising funds through those
partnerships and being able to look for ways to work together to also source talent internationally as we work
across the organization.

And I'd just add. I mean I was in the Middle East a few months ago. We're opening an office in Abu Dhabi. If you
think of the combination of Middle East, India, Japan kind of offsetting what's gone on in China, and then
strategically I would be very surprised if this firm doesn't do some transactions in both Wealth and Asset
Management over the next three years outside the US. I think we have a game plan for it. Strategically, the team
has worked on a lot of ideas, and obviously, we want to make sure when we do it, we're fully ready and we
understand all of the diligence issues around some of these relationships and we're careful about that, but I think
the opportunities are clearly there.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on flows. Obviously fee-based flows strong in the quarter, but the
total flow number came in. And I understand the environment was a bit softer here in the third quarter, but could
you maybe talk about the channels where the pullback was seen the most? You didn't mention workplace, so I'm
not sure. Would love some color there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Thanks, Dan, for the question. We have talked about the fact that within the workplace channel, I think both
in the first and second quarter I've been asked about it and it is – people are using some of that cash. We aren't
necessarily seeing that movement directly into people's accounts and they're taking the stock that they might get
and actually selling it rather than investing in it given what's going on with the economic environment, potentially
inflation, et cetera. So that's potentially a theme out there, but obviously that's dependent on the market.
What is more exciting in my mind is actually where we did see the increase in NNA which was on new clients and
recruiting. So those were the two strongest components and the ability to attract new clients, I said it before on
these calls. If you asked me five years ago, well before we bought E*TRADE and when we were just looking at
the beginning of the modern Wealth platform, many people asked, how will you ever grow? Because we weren't
seeing new clients coming into the institution. The investments that we've made across the technology for Wealth
Management has been what's been able to attract new recruits. So if you talk to recruits about why they come to
Morgan Stanley, it's the products they can offer. It's the technology that we have. It's the ability to work with the
client. So you're seeing that continue, and then you're also seeing new client acquisition through the funnel. So
those are all positive metrics. And again, you see that in the stock plan participants rising as well.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on Investment Banking and understanding the environment isn't ideal,
but you did talk about increase in announcements. So I was hoping you could provide some context maybe on the
sponsor community and maybe how those conversations are happening and just overall backlog levels versus
kind of last quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. The backlog itself continued to rise and to build. Overall, over the course of the year, we've talked a lot
about sort of being at some of the highest levels that we've seen across all, be it underwriting or on the advisory
side. So all of that is optimistic. Financial sponsors, we have talked about dry powder, continue to see that.
Obviously there was some valuation gaps. And as James said, the more clarity that we see around stabilization of
rates, the easier that will be around deployment.
And then some key themes that we have witnessed when we look at the backlog or we think about the
transactions that are happening, one is the financial sector consolidation. That's a theme that's emerging within
our pipeline and our discussions in the boardroom. The second is the energy transitions. Again, that is important
to some of the transactions that we have worked on, and that we've talked through. And in addition to that, we are
seeing emerging themes around technology, around AI, around how companies want to use that when they're
thinking about strategic focus and objectives. And all of these themes are part and parcel to the fact that you can
see it's a diversified backlog. And we're investing in the franchise. We've made some key hires to help us
navigate through this more complex landscape and places where we see opportunities to execute as we move
forward.

So wanted to start with a question on just the expense and margin outlook. Expenses were actually well managed
in the quarter, but one of your peers did talk about competition intensifying in terms of the war for talent within
Investment Banking and Trading. It feels like that's been the case for the better part of a number of years in
Wealth Management. I was hoping you could just speak to your expense growth outlook and your confidence in
terms of your ability to achieve the firm-wide margin target of 30%.

Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So when you think about the expenses, we have been looking at expenses through the cycle. Unfortunately, we
have taken action. We took actions both at the end of last year and then we took one in the spring as well. We've
discussed those severance costs throughout the course of the year. And so we've been managing our expenses
to better understand and to sort of think about it against the backdrop of what environment are we seeing. So
while there's always a war for talent, we do pay for talent and we pay competitively for that talent, but we have to
think about it in the context of where we see the potential growth opportunities.
And that is also – we have to take into account the investments that we're making, and that's around processes
and investing in technology. And when you look at the technology that we're investing in, we should see operating
efficiencies and leverage as you go forward. So that's modernization of the plant. You're going to have
optimization and you're also going to work on things like making sure that you have the right risk and control
framework to give ourselves an opportunity to grow. So, just what it means, to boil it down, is it's a balance of
investing for the future but also making sure that you have the right expense base rather, as you move forward
and you can take advantage and see those efficiency gains and really the operating leverage that James is
talking about, as we move forward through the cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I'd just say one thing on the war for talent. Yeah. I mean, obviously, really high performers are in demand across
the Street, but we've actually had the opposite issue. We've had very low attrition, which is why we did some of
the expense initiatives that Sharon talked about. And I guess we should feel flattered. It's a reflection of the
culture and the stability of the Firm. But also that's why we took the initiatives, because you've got to bring in
talented people and new generations to keep growing this place. So onesies and twosies, yeah, you can lose
somebody, a senior person here or there. We've hired a bunch in banking, as Sharon said. But broader, across
the 80,000 people we've got is, the broader message is, attrition has been remarkably low and that's something
that we've just got to work through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And for my follow-up, just a question on capital. James, you noted that pro forma Basel III endgame.
Your capital requirements approximate your current capital base. How much capital cushion do you plan on
running with? Also, how it informs your buyback; and you addressed a question on ROTCE targets. Curious if that
20% target contemplates higher capital under Basel III. So I know there's a lot in there. Capital cushion, buyback
level, 20% ROTCE target.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Going to have to write this down. For an old guy, this is a lot to remember. It's not going to affect ROTCE. We're
not going to be increasing capital. So that one you can put to bed.
The cushion, it's a function of where the rules come out. I mean I've been very clear about this day one. I do not
believe the proposal as is, will be what we see when the comment period is over. I do not believe that. I've no
special insight except that obviously I've spent a lot of time with the regulatory community which I've done for 14
years. I think everybody understands, for example, the way operating risk RWAs have been calculated in a sort of
blunt instrument based on fees is not – it wasn't what Basel was originally going to do. They were going to take
13


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
that rule out years ago, and they ended up just not getting around to it. And suddenly we're complying with
something that they didn't even want and they don't use in Europe. So it's just not going to happen the way it is
and that's not being pollyannish. That's just my judgment call.
That said, what we want to frame with investors is, God forbid it does happen exactly as is, the rule becomes
proposal rule tomorrow, then we're fine. So we're certainly not going to be raising capital. We're going to continue
with our buyback through that period. The final implementation of this thing is going to be 2028. There's a lot
that's going to happen between now and then, but listen, this is the first time you've had members of the Fed
board and FDIC, I think, come out in advance of a rule being promulgated, if that's the word, saying that they're
not comfortable with it. So there's clearly debate within the regulatory institutions. And if you get past the why we
need more capital, which I don't think the industry does, into well, what should it be; the only place it clearly
shouldn't be is punishing businesses that have fees attached to them whether it's credit cards or Wealth
Management. That's not the regulatory intent and they've told me that, and therefore I believe that will change.
So on the cushion, it's frankly a function of where the rule ends up, we'll carry whatever appropriate prudent
cushion we need to carry. Do we create more capital? No, not unless we grow the business to reflect that, that we
can put it to work. And thirdly, will we continue buybacks? Yes. And I'm sure Sharon can give more flavor on what
we think about on the buyback side, and dividends, for that matter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. On the capital return strategy, we've been really clear that we expect to continue to return capital to our
shareholders. Dan said that at the September conference. Even when you think about our Basel, first and
foremost, we talked about the dividend strategy. We doubled our dividend a few years ago and we've continually
increased the dividend. That increase has been reflective of the growth and stable revenues that we've had, more
broadly as an institution.
Then of course buyback; committed to a buyback, but the size of a buyback is always going to be opportunistic
when you think about what the alternatives are for capital usage, right. So what are the opportunities that we see
going forward? And we'll make the right decision for what we think the right decision is for the company and for
our shareholders around the uses of the capital, but we increased the buyback this quarter. So that shows you
sort of how we feel about being able to return capital to our shareholders when you compare this quarter over the
course of last quarter moving from $1 billion to $1.5 billion.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on the E*TRADE conversion. I'm sure good to get on the other
side of that, and you spoke to some of the benefits I think more on the flow side and revenue side. Just curious if
there's any kind of more material expense saving opportunities, just assuming there's probably some
redundancies there that can be removed, and then any other efficiencies that might exist.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Look, we haven't really – this deal was never contemplated from a cost synergy perspective. It's really been
around revenue synergies. Will there be potential savings on the margin? It's possible, but that's not really the
14

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
point of the transaction. What I think is more fundamentally interesting is a couple of things when you think about
the E*TRADE integration other than the fact that it went very smoothly as it relates to the clients themselves. It
creates a really clear foundation when we're trying to migrate clients from channels and move them; so give
somebody from an E*TRADE channel or self-directed channel and say let's make an introduction to a NFA and
begin that potential migration. If you're on the same platform, it's a much easier and much more seamless
transition. So that's a positive use of that. That's an example of how being on the same platform is helpful.
The same goes for workplace, right. Everything flows into the same places. Again, that should be helpful as we
move forward. It's also very helpful from a bank rails perspective. So, as we think about banking products, as you
can use, remember E*TRADE had bank rails on their platform. Again, a lot of that can be used as we are now
looking to potentially grow portions of the bank or grow lending or grow deposits. Those are all things that now
that the platforms are put together on a consolidated basis. So, I would look at it more from a revenue synergy
perspective than necessarily a cost synergy perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. Thanks, Sharon. Quick follow-up here just on net interest income trajectory in GWM. So, we can
make some assumptions around the trajectory of deposits, but how should we be thinking about the asset yield
trajectory from here, if we use the forward curve. I guess, what are some of the puts and takes to be thinking
about there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yes. Again, So I would look at the movements. If you're trying to draw relationship between sweeps and NII, really
over the last two quarters, the asset yields are going to be a function of what the market yields are. Last quarter,
for example, I mentioned that we had, the NII was supported by higher asset yields. You'll remember that when
we walked out of the first quarter, we were in a position where there was still a regional banking crisis. Some of
the yields were higher, as you think about funding yields simply because what was going on in the environment.
As those yields normalized, that came down, you lost some of that asset yield. And you began to see what we the
deposits themselves had a bigger, more prominent reaction when you look at a sequential change in NII. So what
I would try and do is you should take both quarters, for example, into consideration when you're thinking about the
relationship between sweeps and NII. And of course asset yields will be determined by market factors more
broadly.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, James and Sharon. Thanks for taking my questions. Would like to start similar to that last
question. So, there's clearly uncertainty, but also it seems equally clear that NII is no longer a tailwind for Wealth.
So when you're thinking about the 30% pre-tax margin target that you've provided for that business, what are your
plans given that tailwind may be turning into a headwind or at least moderating and how are you calibrating any
planned investment and balance that out with the potential for growth on the back of that?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Thanks for the question, Brennan. As you would expect, it's a balance, right. We've made changes to our
expense base over the course of this year, but we want to make sure that we're investing for long-term growth by
being able to offer both technology platform solutions, et cetera, so that our advisors – the most important thing
about the investment is to create opportunities where the advisors have more time. The more time that the
advisors have, the more they're able to prospect new business and bring new assets to the top of the funnel. So
that's how we're prioritizing the investments in order to get the operating leverage as the market begins to turn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Is that lever large enough? Are you going to be able to or willing to back investments in order to support
moving towards that 30% pre-tax margin even without NII tailwinds?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
We would see ourselves in a – we're not – we have put out those targets and it's not that there's a shot clock in
terms of the timing of those targets, Brennan. The goal is to create a business model that has the opportunity to
do that on a more sustained basis. And the way that one is to do that from an asset-led strategy is to grow the
Asset Management revenue streams and the transactional streams, and that's what you're seeing over the course
of this quarter alone. You're able to grow assets. You're able to deploy those assets into different transactional
products which helps the transactional line, and eventually it also moves into the advice-based relationship
products which has a higher annuity stream as well; and so, that's the strategy and you're seeing it play out as we
move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I'd just point out, Brennan. I mean on $6.5 billion of revenue, the deficit against the 30% long-term target is
currently about $120 million, $130 million. So we're talking less than 2%. We're already at 28% ex the integration
costs. They could take 2% of the costs out of that business tomorrow and hit that number. So this is not – back in
the day when we were talking about 20% margin and we were at 8%, that was when certain people were
skeptical about that. We're in a whole different league now. 28% can go to 30%. We can make that happen. What
we want to make sure is we make happen the growth over the next several years. So this is not a heavy lift. So
I'm not worried about that at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you for that. If you could, Sharon, maybe just one more clarification. Could you talk about the asset
side? And looking at market yields, what's the duration that we should be thinking about if we're trying to
calibrate? Because the disclosure on the asset side for Wealth is not as robust. We have to kind of use a couple
creative metrics within the filings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
In general, when you're talking about the AFS portfolio, the duration of the AFS portfolio is under two. But what
you have to think about is just the deposits themselves and what's going on with right now, when we look at it,
we're slightly still asset sensitive. But of course if rates rise, the deposit duration also shortens. So I just think you
have to think about you're taking all things into consideration as you move forward given the cycle.

Hey good morning. Maybe just pivoting to the Trading business, FICC trading up sequentially, a bit unusual in a
seasonally slow third quarter. So maybe just talk a little about the drivers, how sustainable you think they are at
least in the near-term, and maybe overall thoughts on industry wallet into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. It's a great question. When you look at what's gone on in terms of the industry wallet, we talked a lot about
2019 and 2020 being book ends. Obviously, you are above the 2019 wallet more broadly and you see this playing
out because things like Fixed Income, you do have more central bank action and you do you have more broadly
associated vol when you think about pre-COVID levels. So, all that is fundamentally positive. In terms of,
specifically, the Trading businesses, you had movements like I said in commodities, oil. That ability to capture vol,
it's really around being there for our clients but having greater velocity of sheet. And the more that we're able to
do that as we move forward, we restructured this business tremendously over the course of the last eight years,
nine years and it's being there to be able to serve our clients and using our resources to some degree more
effectively and efficiently.

Hi. One kind of positive question, one negative question maybe James. When you think of the permanent
improvement from 2019 levels pre-pandemic, how much higher do you think global wallet share should be for
both Investment Banking and Trading? Like, as you look out over three to five years, was 2019 the normal or
should it be above that? Because global wallet share is drifting back towards 2019, although the big US banks are
staying above that. And then the negative question is, just NII is down 9% quarter-over-quarter in Wealth, and
what are you guiding for that to be down? And when do you think that inflects? Thanks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Sure. I think the global wallet will trend higher than 2019. I think right now we're obviously at an extreme low on
the banking side and trading is kind of muted. Fixed Income, yeah, we had a sequential nice run, Equity is at
3.5% and nowhere near top levels. I don't see any of the global competitors challenging the sort of top of the US
three, the top three or four firms. And I think what's going on, as I said earlier with the Middle East and India,
Japan, parts of LatAm, you're going to see non-US growth over the next several years. So, yeah I feel actually
really pretty good about the outlook. And I'll let Sharon – I think we've touched on a lot of the NII stuff and
obviously you can't model this stuff. You don't know exactly how people will behave because it's a function of how
they feel about where rates are and other opportunities at any point in time, but Sharon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A

Yeah. We're not giving 2024 guidance right here, but what we did say is that the next quarter we have said will be
lower. And that's a function mathematically of the exit rates of deposits where we entered the quarter, but what is
encouraging is that as we ended September and then we looked into October, our client behavior is in line with
our modeled expectation.

Thank you. Good morning, Sharon. Good morning, James. I'll just ask a single question in view of the time. Can
you guys give us a view of the outlook for your mergers and acquisitions, your appetite? Obviously, James, over
your tenure you guys have done a number of successful acquisitions. And as you look out over the next three
years to five years, I know, James, you won't be here but what's the appetite? Is it still something opportunistic if
something comes up? It seems like you have all of your products lined up by channel, but can you get economies
of scale by buying some competitors in different channels? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Definitely the latter. It's not just opportunistic. It's strategic, in that we have a game plan. We just completed an off-
site a month ago with the whole operating committee and each of the leaders that you know all about, Ted, Andy,
and Dan, were heavily engaged in that from the business side. I think there are a lot of interesting properties in
this world and we've got a machine. Jim Hennessy, I'll give a callout to him. He led the integration of E*TRADE.
He actually led the integration going all the way back to Smith Barney, hundreds of people that worked on that. So
we've got an integration machine. You start with you have a vision of what the company should look like, and then
do you have a set of strategic options which, if available, you would hit the bid. Then the opportunistic is when
they become available like Eaton Vance, did you hit the bid? But the real issue is, can you integrate them safely
and securely and then finally having done that, will that drive growth above the current run rate.
So that's how we think about acquisitions. The team is very weighted behind it. I don't know, Sharon, if you want
to add anything to that, but yeah. This firm will do sensible, not reckless, not life-changing but sensible deals, as
we've done. We've done many of them, Mesa West, Solium, and there's a lot of opportunity out there, Gerard. I
think that's a wrap.
