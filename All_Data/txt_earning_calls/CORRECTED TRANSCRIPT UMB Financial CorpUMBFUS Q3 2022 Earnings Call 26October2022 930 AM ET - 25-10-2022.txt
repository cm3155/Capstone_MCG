Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported our third quarter
results reflecting positive momentum across our business lines. Highlights include robust loan growth, coupled
with strong asset quality and solid core revenue growth. Net income for the third quarter was $88 million or $1.81
per share. Operating pre-tax, pre-provision income was $131.2 million or $2.70 per share. Net interest income
increased 3.9% sequentially, driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in average loans, positive asset mix, and the
impact of rising rates. This was partially negated by increased deposit costs, largely driven by a transition from
DDAs to rate-bearing accounts, which is typical in an interest rate cycle such as the one we're seeing today, the
timing of deposit initiatives to attract new-to-bank customers in each of our business lines, the availability of
attractive short-tenor investment options, and the impact of clients reacting to typical market pressures in a rising
rate environment, particularly on our rate-sensitive institutional businesses. This is consistent with what we're
seeing from other trusts and custody banks like ourselves.
Our cycle-to-date beta on interest-bearing deposits have been 46% and 27% on total deposits. As we've noted in
the past, our business profile and funding mix is uniquely skewed in favor of our commercial and institutional
sources. These sources experience different pace and timing than many of our peers in the re-pricing
environment.
Our businesses performed well, driving noninterest income growth, excluding the impact of the nonrecurring gain
from the sale of Visa Class B shares in the second quarter. Additional drivers are included in our slides, and Ram
will share more detail shortly.
Excluding contributions from PPP and the market-related impact from the gains and losses on investment
securities, we've generated operating leverage of 4% year-to-date. This continues to be the focus for us, and we
expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. Pipelines and sales activity continue to be strong
across the company, and I'll share a few highlight from the various businesses.
In private wealth, our team has surpassed full-year 2021 sales, bringing it to $874 million in new assets year-to-
date. Our institutional banking teams are continuing to perform well. Year-to-date new business volumes have
increased 16% and Corporate Trust and escrow services and 35% in Specialty Trust. And public finance has
closed 110 deals so far in 2022, on track to exceed 2021 levels. Fund Services and Institutional Custody assets
under administration levels have been impacted by equity market valuations in 2022. And AUA levels now stand
at $352 billion. However, the teams continue to bring in new clients, including more than 200 new custody
accounts year-to-date. And the Fund Services contribution to our trust income has increased 6.2% year-over-
year.
In Healthcare Services, we ranked among the top 10 HSA providers in the US. We expect the acquisition of the
Old National Bancorp's HSA business to close in mid-November. This acquisition will bolster our position with an
additional $400 million in expense and deposits and approximately $100 million in investment assets.
Moving to lending, the drivers behind our nearly 22% linked-quarter annualized growth in average balances this
quarter are on slide 24.
Total topline loan production, as shown on slide 25, remained strong at $1.3 billion for the quarter. Payoffs and
paydown represents 4.7% of loans rebounding from the low levels second quarter. Commercial real estate and
construction loans posted 20% annualized growth in the third quarter. While payoffs will fluctuate from quarter to

quarter, we expect we will see then eventually begin to slow due to general slowdown as anticipated in the rising
rate environment.
We saw continued outperformance to CNI, with average balances increasing 27% on a linked quarter annualized
basis and making up more than half of this quarter's total growth. Industrial production continues to be strong and
we're seeing a good mix of new customer acquisition and increased borrowings from existing commercial
relationships. Loan increases are moving closer to pre-pandemic levels and general customers' comments
indicates that draws are largely related to [ph] this leading (00:06:36) stimulus/liquidity, higher inventories and
higher prices.
Average residential mortgage balances have increased 23% over the third quarter of last year, despite the impact
of rising rates. Our Down Payment Assistance Program designed for first time homebuyers in underserved
markets has had more than a 1,000 new applications, resulting in $1.6 million in assistance year-to-date. Looking
ahead to the fourth quarter, we see opportunity in our various verticals across the footprint and we expect
continued strong growth to round out the year.
On the other side of the balance sheet, average total deposits for the quarter decreased 5.7% compared to the
second quarter, driven primarily by DDA outflows from elevated second quarter levels, primarily in our institutional
businesses. Compared to the third quarter of 2021, our DDA balances increased 8.7%, led by Corporate Trust,
commercial and investor solution verticals. Because of the often project-based orientation of our Corporate Trust
businesses, we can just as easily see spikes in DDA as we have seen a decline this past quarter. DDA balances
represent 42% of average deposits, compared to 45% in the second quarter and 39% in the third quarter of last
year. We continue to focus on deposit gathering, including the deposit initiatives I mentioned as well as engaging
with our current customers.
One area of growth we're excited about is our Business Banking and Practice Finance vertical, which has seen
exceptional deposit growth over the past few years. We continue to invest in this business to drive future growth
on both sides of the balance sheet. While we see cycle-to-date beta on our interest-bearing deposits of
approximately 46%, I think the metric alone gives an incomplete view as it ignores the benefit of DDA balances
which have a zero beta and the impact of our borrowing levels which have been at 100% beta. I'd encourage you
to look at our total cost of funds instead, which have had a beta of 32% thus far this year. Additionally, we benefit
on the earning assets side with cycle-to-date beta of nearly 50%. In this environment, we expect loan growth and
improving asset yields will continue to drive above peer growth and net interest income.
Moving to asset quality, net charge-offs in the third quarter were just 0.02% of average loans, while non-accrual
loans remained steady at 10 basis points of loans. We continue to stress that our full-year loss rate will be
consistent with our long-term historical averages of approximately 25 basis points to 30 basis points or less.
Provision for the quarter of $22 million was driven by our continued strong loan growth, portfolio metrics, and
changes in the macroeconomic outlook. Our reserve coverage is now at 0.93% of total loans. In September, we
were successful in raising $110 million in capital through our subordinated notes offering that will help us facilitate
our expected balance sheet growth for the remainder of this year and on into 2023.
Our own UMB Capital Markets team participated as co-manager, bringing in clients that made up about a third of
the total offering. The capital raise favorably impacted our ratios. September 30 total capital and leverage ratios
were 13.13% and 8.66%, respectively. And in our press release, we announced that the board had approved a
2.7% increase in our dividend, bringing it to $0.38 per share, payable in January.

Finally, we've seen many changes in the outlook for markets and the economy in the last few months. We've got
unprecedented Fed tightening and record inflation, along with uncharacteristically tight labor market and
geopolitical conflict, along with contagion effect from across the Atlantic, have increased economic uncertainty.
We have active dialogues with our own clients about their businesses and outlooks. Borrowers are generally
optimistic about the rest of 2022 and remain cautiously so looking forward, although most are concerned about
rising costs.
While our customers are in good shape, we, like many others, expect that we may experience a shorter
recessionary environment. Historically, the leading economic index or the LEI has become a good indicator. In
more than 40 years of history, a drop in the six-month rate of the LEI below negative 3% has proceeded through
the recession. As of last week, the index was at negative 5.6%, further decreasing from a negative 5% at the end
of August. Unlike the previous cycle, banks came into this cycle with stronger capital positions and the consumers
came in more liquid and less leveraged. Therefore, we don't expect it to be as destructive, but more of a reset to
the economy.
As I mentioned, we see good growth opportunities in the fourth quarter, although we'll continue to watch closely
for early warning signs for deterioration, which at this point seem to be contained in specific areas such as
consumer and discretionary. This is where we differentiate ourselves by rowing close to shore, which is part of our
risk management philosophy that keeps us prepared for all environments. In closing, I'm proud of our teams, as
always, as they continue to work together and work hard to support our customers and communities.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for additional comments. Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mariner. Let me start with some commentary on balance sheet trends, starting with our liquidity profile on
page 21. Our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances further declined to $1.5 billion and now comprises
4.3% of average earning assets, with a blended yield of 2.30% compared to 83 basis points in the second quarter.
As we've done in prior tightening cycles, we deployed cash flows from our high-quality securities portfolio to fund
loan growth opportunities during the third quarter.
As shown on slide 28, the portfolio roll-off for the third quarter was $304 million at a yield of 1.96%, while we
purchased $54 million in securities, primarily CLOs with a yield of 4.86%. Additionally, the portfolio is expected to
generate over $1.1 billion of cash flow in the next 12 months. The yield of those securities rolling off is
approximately 1.83%. While treasury yields present very attractive reinvestment levels, our priority is to fund the
opportunities we continue to see in our lending verticals.
In 2022, we reclassified securities to the held-to-maturity portfolio to help manage tangible capital and reduce the
impact of rising rates on our equity. Average HTM balances for the third quarter, excluding the $1.2 billion of
revenue bonds we've long held in that book were $4.6 billion. Loan yields increased 74 basis points from the
second quarter to 4.46%, with a cycle-to-date beta of approximately 37%. 61% or about $12.1 billion of loans are
variable rate, with 60% of those re-pricing in the next quarter and 71% re-pricing within the next 12 months. These
are largely tied to indices at the short end of the curve.
The total cost of deposits, including DDAs was 65 basis points, up from 20 basis points last quarter and the cycle-
to-date beta is approximately 27%. Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points from the second quarter. Net
interest margin benefited by approximately 43 basis points from loan re-pricing and mix, 30 basis points from the
5

benefit of free funds and 24 basis points from reduced liquidity balances and rate. These were partially offset by a
negative 81 basis points related to the cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities.
As we look ahead, there are a lot of variables at play that will impact the trajectory of our net interest margin,
including the depth and duration of the Fed's tightening cycle, outlook for equity markets and that impact on
deposits, expected disintermediation of DDA balances as ECR rates increase, as well as our own need to
generate deposits through targeted campaigns to fund loan growth. Based on our own simulations which includes
the mid-quarter onboarding of HSA deposits from Old National and the seasonal inflow of indexed public funds
deposits, we expect our fourth quarter net interest margin to be flat to slightly down from third quarter levels. This
assumes a Fed funds rate of 4.5% at year-end. As Mariner noted, while deposits and deposit betas and NIM is
important, we focus primarily on net interest income growth, as illustrated primarily by loan growth.
Additionally, as you've heard I say before, another metric that we manage too is the loan-to-deposit ratio limit of
75%. With our ratio approaching 65%, we will continue to focus on deposits and client acquisitions across all our
lines of business. The estimated impact of net interest income in various rate scenarios based on [ph] September
30 (00:16:12) balances is shown on slide 30.
In a rate ramp scenario of plus 100 basis points on a static balance sheet, net interest income is predicted to fall
0.6% in year one and increase by 2.9% in year two. This analysis assumes re-pricing of our variable rate loans
based on underlying changes to LIBOR, SOFR and other indices as well, as well as deposit betas consistent with
the prior cycle.
One variable that's missing in this prescribed analysis is what happens to our growth-related net interest income.
The ultimate effect of incremental rate hikes on NII will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate
movements, loan growth and balance sheet management strategies.
Back to the income statement, total fee income for the quarter was $128.7 million. The second quarter included a
$66.2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our Visa Class B shares recorded in investment securities gains.
As shown in the commentary on slide 18 early in our presentation, fee income excluding income or loss from
equity valuations was $130.1 million compared to $115.6 million in the second quarter. This variance included a
$13 million increase in company-owned life insurance income and a $1.2 million increase in derivative income
related to customer back-to-back swaps.
Other areas of strong performance include card services income and brokerage fees, the latter of which captures
our money market revenue share and 12b-1 fee income. Total brokerage income increased $1.4 million or nearly
12% compared to the second quarter, despite market related compression of approximately 3% in the underlying
money market balances.
Other drivers were shown on slide 22 and are discussed in the press release.
Slide 23 shows trends in our non-interest expense. The linked quarter increase was driven primarily by the
change in deferred compensation expense, which was $2.3 million in the third quarter versus the credit of $9.2
million in the second quarter. This is related to the increased COLI income I mentioned previously. We saw a
$12.5 million increase in salary and wage expense, reflecting one additional salary day in the quarter as well as
selective hiring in some of our lines of businesses. Additionally, we booked $3.7 million of operational losses,
which are not expected to recur. These increases were offset by an increase of $4.8 billion in charitable
contributions expense recorded in other expense.

A few other items to keep in mind as we look at expenses going forward. In October, the FDIC announced the 2-
basis point increase in the settlement rates beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Based on current data, we
estimate this will have an approximate impact of $6 million pre-tax. And fourth quarter expenses will include the
yet to be determined pro-rata amortization impact from the acquisition of $400 million in HSA deposits expected to
close mid-quarter. Finally, like in prior fourth quarter periods, we will make a $2 million charitable contribution to
organizations serving our communities as well as making any needed true-ups to performance-based in central
accruals.
As Mariner noted, as we approach our 2023 budget increase, our focus remains on generating positive operating
leverage while prudently investing in our businesses. Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for the third quarter and
18.8% year-to-date, reflecting a smaller portion of income from tax exempt municipal securities. For the full-year
2022, we estimated to be approximately 18% to 20%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just starting on deposits. If we look at, sort of, the DDA levels pre-COVID, you were around 32%. Should
we expect that we sort of trend back towards that level with the pressure on DDA from the ECR and the other
items you mentioned? Or do you think there's some systemic or structural change that could keep that at a higher
level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I think, this is Mariner, some of the DDA drawdown that's happened over the quarter has been based on,
obviously, the higher rate environment, and the customers looking to participate in that, as well as higher costs
and inflation, such as customers that put their money to work in an inflationary environment. I think as you look

forward, just specifically thinking about DDAs, as you look forward into a recessionary environment or beyond that
and more normalized environment, DDAs should remain at strong levels as they have been in the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess this...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And one of the – Jared, this is Ram and I would say, we've added a lot of new clients over the last 12 months on
the heels of the PPP program that we talked about, the halo effect of the PPP program. So, when you think about
new clients, right, so yeah, right, the last great cycle, we did go down to 32% composition. But this time around, I
think we feel like it'll be higher than that as the rate cycle peaks, because we've been adding new clients with
DDA balances as well, particularly in small business. You heard Mariner talk about the efforts of small business
and how that is driven some DDA growth. So, I would say, we probably end up doing better than last cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, a temporary short squeeze on that, I guess is the way to describe it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, okay. I guess just following up on that or on the deposit side, how should we be thinking about through the
cycle beta now? I think we saw a little bit of an acceleration on interest-bearing deposits cost this quarter. How
are we thinking about – how should we think about through the cycle beta either, I guess on the interest-bearing
or on total, since you're – you seem to focus on that a little more?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, we obviously think total is the way to think about it. And the total was in the 30%, low-30% range. I think if
you – last quarter or before, we telegraphed that we would be early to go through the cycle as a more commercial
and institutionally-heavy deposit base for our company, and that's basically what we've produced. We still expect
to end whatever cycle we have similar to the last cycle and we don't have any reason to expect that to be any
different. We feel like we're tracking that way. So, we end up in the round of 50%, 52%, somewhere, a couple of
clicks one way or the other. We were around 52% last time. We've telegraphed that in the last couple calls. That's
where our expectations are. We'll see how that ends up. But I don't have anything telling us it being anything
other than that. And the way we believe it is, on a relative basis, we just go through it earlier. And then, you also
have to think about obviously total cost, not just the interest bearing, just keep that in mind. And then, lastly, you
can't forget the impact of what we're able to do on the asset side.
So, with more than 50% of our loans re-pricing within 12 months, we got the re-pricing of the current book, the
back book, and then a significant portion of our loan growth is from new customers. And all of the new customer
growth comes in at a higher yield. So, our loan-to-asset betas were 54% on a linked-quarter basis and 37% cycle-
to-date. We expect to continue to perform well on the asset side and particularly on the loan side.

Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
[ph] Through that (00:25:06), yeah. Okay. And then, on the COLI side, with the corresponding expense, is this a
third quarter sort of a one-time thing, or is this now a new level from additional purchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No. We have it quarter in, quarter out. That's part of our deferred comp administration. So, we try to mimic those
assets and any mark-to-market fluctuations get written up or down in fee income just like we have this product,
deferred comp expenses. So, we try to break it out, so last quarter because of what happened to the equity
market. Our deferred comp expense or COLI income came down by about $11 million and this quarter, it
recovered to a positive $2 million, creating a $13 million. So, this quarter's impact of fee income at the benefit
from COLI was only $2 million. Same thing on the deferred comp side, we had more expenses of about $2.5
million reflected in our $231 million expense base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Ram, I think in your prepared remarks, you said – you talked about a 75% ultimate terminal loan-to-deposit ratio.
So, you got plenty of room. I'm kind of interested in, I guess when and how you get there. I understand the
comments on loan growth and also saw you really didn't buy any bonds in the quarter, but is the math, deposits
continue to be positive, but perhaps trail loan growth or do we see more downdraft in the deposits and securities
book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we fully expect to continue to grow our deposits and we've become much more active in the market
competing in this environment where our customers have options and as the short end of the curve has come up
the way it has. It's a different environment than we've seen in the past, where obviously customers have lots of
options in this rate environment. So we've been – we remain competitive and more so recently, so that we can
keep up with our loan growth. And then, the real goal and job of ours is to remain disciplined on our loan pricing.
And we believe we can do that, so then it's ultimately about maintenance in our margin and spread more and
growing our net interest income than it is worrying about deposit betas, which we really can't control in this
environment.
So, we focus on all good stuff, the growth and the drivers we think we can continue to produce above pure level
growth, both on the asset side and on the fee side. We've done that for a long time in the 20 years I've been CEO,
we've met the expectations and delivered the growth we expect of ourselves and we expect to continue to do that.
And when the Fed pivots, when we get that announcement, that will re-normalize the cost side of our structure.
So, this is really a short-term problem. We don't manage this company for the quarter. We manage it for multiple
years in advance. And our growth profile remains very strong. And when the Fed pivots, things will normalize for
us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that color, Mariner. Ram, the $1.1 billion of bonds that come due over the next year, I guess,
fair to say that new money, this is more accretive to put those into the loan book and perhaps, shrink the bond
portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's right. Yeah, we don't – the last three to four months, we have not reinvested other than a very tiny sliver
into CLOs. We've not reinvested our cash flows, and it's all part of the loan to deposit question that you asked
previously managing that. I mean, we can do – we've done this in the past with balance sheet rotation

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

right?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, the – I think you said you're still finalizing the incremental expense on the deposit deal. But I think
Old National disclosed that there was a roughly $95 million premium paid for those $400 million deposits. How do
I think about just incremental intangible assets in the back of capitals? Is it that full amount of money that goes
into intangibles?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's the part we're still working on. So, it's hard to give you a number right now, but I just wanted to show that
there that expenses will include that. So, the classification between business goodwill and intangibles that gets
amortized, we're still going through the calculations of that.

Question on the operating leverage outlook, obviously some nice improvement this quarter. Do you think the
improvement that we saw in your efficiency ratio here in the third quarter is sustainable in this type of rate
environment or how are you guys going to think about managing expenses going forward apart from kind of the
true-up that you had in compensation costs and let it be strong production that you've seen so far this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, a lot of the expenses that we've talked about in the past tend to be variable in nature and driven by
overall company performance or [indiscernible] (00:31:47) production, right? So the fact that we're focused on
positive operating leverage for the fourth quarter and for the 2023 budget would suggest that the efficiency ratio
will improve from here. So, obviously, we'll be investing. As we said in the prepared remarks, we'll be investing in
our businesses, hiring for 2023 and 2024, but at the same time, we'll react to the revenue environment and what's
happening on the revenue side of the equation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. And then, just maybe turning to the outlook for provision going forward. I imagine growth may
moderate in this macro environment to maybe the high single-digit range, kind of consistent with your historical
trajectory over time. How do you guys think about providing for that type of growth trajectory going forward and
absent any kind of CECL-related adjustments on the Q factors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, it's hard to do a absent CECL, but because that's a big driver. I think a big portion of our third quarter
provision was from loan growth. And so, that's – that was the largest number in there. And obviously, our loan
quality is incredibly strong. So, the combination really going forward for provisioning will be from outsized loan
growth and macro environment statistics driven by our Moody's information. And I suppose your guess is as good
as ours. So, I would suggest that that data will not be getting any better anytime soon. So, as you think about the
fourth quarter, we expect to have strong loan growth and at least – I don't – who knows what Moody's will say. I
don't think it's necessarily getting any worse. But it's certainly not going to get any better, that data. So, it's an
[indiscernible] (00:33:45) deal based on what's going on in the economy with unemployment and what's going on
with the loan growth.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Okay. Great. And then, just on the heels of the debt raised recently, obviously, [indiscernible] (00:34:02) those
supportive of some pretty strong loan growth in the quarter. Just curious if that added capital buffer is perhaps
supportive of some increased M&A dialogue of later if you're feeling kind of more or less optimistic on additional
acquisitions outside the deposits that will be coming on board in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We remain active in pursuit of acquisitions. We continue to pursue those. We'd like to add solid franchises to the
base of our organization when we can find the right deal that fits. And so, nothing new there. Just we're active in
our calling efforts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John Rodis Q

Ram, just back to the expense, looking at expenses for the quarter, what is the right number to back out for this
quarter for the COLI impact? Is it the $2 million or is it the $11.5 million, just to sort of get a good run rate going
forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Just on the deferred comp, I would take out $2.5 million, and then we've talked about an operating loss for
about $4 million. And then, there were some $1 million to $2 million of timing-related expenses on travel and
marketing campaign. So, we started with a $231 million of reported expenses. There were some onetime items. I
would put them in the $7 million to $8 million category of things that we don't control or don't expect to recur. So,
the run rate, I would say, is closer to $223-ish million, and then, all the other items that I talked about in terms of
the charitable contribution just for the fourth quarter, the FDIC assessment increase for starting 2023, and then
the amort related to the HSA purchase.

Looking at the reserve build in the quarter, I know you're pointing to the loan growth side of things. Was the loans
that you added require additional reserves? It just looks to me like the addition, if you're using your overall reserve
level, the loan growth should have been a smaller contributor. Just curious what maybe loans you added, and
then what else may have contributed to the build in the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, the loan growth in the quarter was $990 million...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
$990 million.

...$990 million. And so, it was pretty significant component of it. It's driven by CECL. It's a mathematical equation
that requires us to do what we do. I don't know if that answers your question, but it's – it was a significant quarter
in loan growth. And so, we provisioned against it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Each new loan that comes on the books requires a reserve – a percentage of reserve. So, by definition, new
loans will have to reserve requirement right out of the gate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Sure. Got it. Okay. And then, taking this a step further, looking at your total reserve level, when CECL came out,
we thought it was going to be very quantitative. And what we've heard since then is there's a good qualitative
portion. Can you discern between the two? Is there a portion of your reserve that you'd say is qualitative versus
quantitative? And how much of it would be qualitative, if so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It's hard to give you that specifically. But there is – I would call the qualitative piece on the margin is what I would
describe that as. And the majority of it is driven by quantitative, mathematical – mathematically driven based on
loss history, roll on and roll off, loan growth and macroeconomic environment. And then, you got a piece of it that
we can use our own assessment of the environment and our own balance sheet and our own dynamics on a
qualitative basis to move that up or down on a market basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you for your question. There are no more questions waiting at this time, so I will pass the call
back to our management team for closing remarks. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Mariner. I might just wrap it up by reiterating our thesis for where we stand and some of the
concerns in the marketplace for the industry around deposit betas and kind of how we see that shaping up for us
specifically.
As we've been saying now for a few quarters, we are largely institutional commercial that's not new. Our base –
deposit base is not new, and we've been here before. I've been CEO 20 years. We've seen this before. We just
telegraphed that we're going to go through it early. We've gone through it early. We still expect to come in right
where we thought we would in the 50% – low-50% range on the beta side, and we think that you, as analysts and
investors, should focus more on the whole balance sheet and NII as they are the drivers for our success and
performance long term, our ability to grow our loans, our ability to have strong quality with 2 basis points of
charge-offs and 10 basis points on the nonperforming side.

So, we think that, on a risk-adjusted basis with the growth that we have, we think you should focus more on the
profile of the business and less on the short-term Fed actions squeezed, and the Fed will kind of pivot soon. That
will normalize our costs, and you will be left with what you normally see with us which is an outsized growth profile
with a better-than-average risk profile. So, that has all remained the same, and we expect to see fourth quarter
loan growth as strong as it was in the third quarter with the same kind of quality. And so, there's nothing new here
on our end, we just got to live through the short squeeze in the fret. And we appreciate your continued interest
and we'll keep after it.
