Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Adrienne. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'm pleased
to report another strong quarter of balanced growth in support of our customers.
Third quarter 2024 net income was $299 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. We grew average loans by 1%
quarter-over-quarter, and further diversified our loan portfolio by emphasizing residential and C&I lending. We
grew average deposits by 3% quarter-over-quarter through continued growth of granular customer deposits and
relationships. Net interest income grew by $20 million or 4% from second quarter, primarily driven by increased
income from loans. We also lowered the cost of average interest-bearing deposit in the quarter. The average cost
of time, money market and savings deposit, each declined from the second quarter.
Our balance sheet growth was complemented by a consecutive quarter of record fee income. These revenues
were driven by notable strength in lending, wealth management and deposit fees, reflecting our consistent
execution and ability to broaden and deepen customer relationships. Our disciplined approach to credit
management serve us well in the third quarter. East West classified loans, non-accrual and non-performing asset
ratios improved during the quarter. Nonetheless, we remain vigilant about managing our credit risk, and are
proactively managing our risk profile. We have delivered substantial returns for shareholders during the quarter.
We reported tangible book value per share growth of 7%, and generated over 17% return on average tangible
common equity.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Chris, I will turn it to you for more detail on our financial performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic.
Turning to loans on slide 4. Average and period-end loans each grew by 1% quarter-over-quarter. Residential
mortgage production was remarkably consistent for the quarter, and our pipeline levels remain strong going into
Q4. We expect residential mortgage growth to continue at its current pace.
With respect to C&I growth, it was driven by notable strength in our entertainment and private equity verticals. We
also expect C&I to have similar growth in Q4. In commercial real estate, we saw healthy growth in multifamily
during Q3. Across the rest of our commercial real estate business, we continue to work with our longstanding
clients, and foresee only a modest level of CRE loan growth overall in Q4.
Moving on to deposits on slide 5. We grew average and end-of-period deposits by 3% to a record $61.7 billion,
with growth across Consumer, Business Banking and Commercial customers. Our non-interest bearing deposit
mix stood at 24% of total deposits.
Slide 6 summarizes our on-balance sheet liquidity. During the third quarter, we took further steps to enhance our
liquidity profile, while supporting earnings. We added a net $1.2 billion of securities in Q3, primarily short-duration
floaters, and grew our average cash and equivalents by nearly $1 billion to $5 billion. The securities portfolio at
yearend stood at $13.1 billion, including $6 billion-plus of Ginnie Mae floating rate securities. Our average
securities yield increased 10 basis points from Q2, reflecting the purchases. Our cash and securities portfolio rose
to 24% of total average assets at the end of the third quarter.
Slide 7 covers our net interest income trends. Third quarter dollar net interest income totaled $573 million, a $20
million increase from the second quarter, driven primarily by greater income from loans. Our net interest margin
was 3.24%, a decline of 3 basis points from the prior quarter, partially reflecting Fed rate cuts. At the end of the
third quarter, our total deposit cost stood at 284 basis points, down 10 basis points from the end of the second
quarter. Our end-of-period total interest-bearing deposit cost stood at 373 basis points at the end of third quarter,
down 19 basis points from the prior period. Additionally, total deposit costs have continued to decline since
quarter-end, and are now approximately 5 basis points to 10 basis points lower still. We expect balance sheet
growth to support net income levels from here.
Slide 8 summarizes our non-interest income trends. As Dominic mentioned, we achieved a record fee income
level of $81 million this quarter, up 6% quarter-over-quarter. The strength was driven by significant syndications
activity and strong traction in commercial cash management solutions, while wealth management was buoyed by
focused execution on growth strategies and strong equity markets.
I'll now turn the call over to Irene for comments on credit and capital.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
On slide 9, credit trends remained stable, and the asset quality of our portfolio as a whole remained strong.
Provision for credit losses increased $5 million from the second quarter to $42 million. Net charge-offs in the third
quarter were $29 million or 22 basis points annualized, compared to 18 basis points annualized in the second
quarter. Non-performing assets fell by 1 basis point to 26 basis points of total assets quarter-over-quarter. The
special mention loans ratio rose slightly to 0.88%, while total classified loans decreased 2 basis points to 1.20%.
The absolute level of problem loans, criticized loans and non-performing assets remain low and at manageable
levels.
Regarding commercial real estate loan maturities, as of September 30, 2024, 3% of total outstanding balances
are scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter of 2024, and 11% of outstanding balances are set to mature in the
year 2025. For office loans, specifically, 4% of outstanding balances are scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter
2024, and 70% are set to mature in 2025. We remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risk. Based on
what we know today, we continue to expect fourth quarter and full-year net charge-offs to be in the range of 15
basis points to 25 basis points.
As seen on slide 10, our allowance for credit losses ended the third quarter at $696 million, or 1.31%, 1 basis
point higher than the prior period end. We believe our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved as of September 30,
2024.
Turning to slide 11. East West regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for well-
capitalized institutions, and well-above regional bank averages. East West Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio
stands at 14.1%, while the tangible common equity ratio is at 9.7%. We currently have $49 million of repurchase
authorization that remains available for future buybacks. East West's fourth quarter 2024 dividends will be
payable on November 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 4, 2024.
I will now turn it back to Chris to share a few comments on our outlook for the full year. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene.
Looking to slide 12, we've reiterated our full-year outlook. It's unchanged – assuming the forward curve as of
yearend, it's unchanged from our September updates. We continue to expect a full-year end-of-period loan growth
in the range of 2% to 4%. And I would note we've grown approximately 2% through the end of the third quarter.
We also expect full-year net interest income to still decline in the range of 2% to 4%. And year-to-date, our net
interest income has declined 3%.
With that, I'll now open the call for additional questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from
Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I wanted to check in on the deposit growth rate. It looks like you grew
deposits at a faster pace than loans yet again. Can you talk about the rationale for that? Are you deliberately
working towards a lower loan-to-deposit ratio and building more liquidity? Or did it just happen that you were able
to grow deposits faster? And do you expect that that gives you more flexibility for funding loan growth as we get
into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Manan, for the question. Yes, we think it affords us more flexibility. As you'll note, we actually lowered
deposit pricing during the quarter, and have continued to lower it here into Q4, and have still benefited from net
inflows. And so, we'll take this organic net inflow and think about how that can help us optimize our liability profile
as we move forward. But it's been nice wind in our sails.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, the midpoint of the guide implies NII slightly down from 3Q levels. Is that a function of lower
rates? And I know you have some swaps maturing in 1Q. So, can you just remind us how you expect NIM and NII
to trend over the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I would say that we're inside of the range. I didn't say we'd be at the midpoint or one side or the other, but I feel
pretty good about the Q4 dynamics. And I would say that the swaps won't really have an impact until Q1, and we
do think they will come off throughout the quarter and Q1 end of January into February, and they will have a
positive effect. I think we've previously quantified that north of $10 million run rate into the numbers.

Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Just on capital, it seems like it's just hard to keep that TCE ratio down. And I know you got some help of lower
rates this quarter. But just wanted to get your updated thoughts on buybacks as TCE continues to grow here. It
kind of seems like we're going to hit that 10% level without buybacks unless balance sheet growth really
continues at a strong pace here. So, any update there would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. We were targeting that sort of 9.49-ish level. Without the AOCI, we were right there. Obviously, we are
thankful for the pick-up in AOCI that brought that level closer to 9.7%. But we continue to be patient and
opportunistic in our approach to capital, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet
as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. And then, just on liquidity management, will the cash continue to grow here, assuming deposits
exceed loan growth? Or is the plan to start to plough those into or continue to build the securities book here? And
any thought to going with some fixed rate stuff here, just to reduce the asset sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'll take those. There's two different parts. First part on the deposits, I think we're taking a look at our deposit
pricing and being very disciplined about that, and we'll continue to do so. That may lead us to run-off some of the
higher cost deposits as we move through Q4. And that will be perfectly fine. We are not necessarily looking to
overleverage or further leverage the balance sheet, and we will obviously be very focused on driving the right
optimization.
On the second part of your question, fixed versus floating, I think we've been thoughtful about that. We've
benefited from the strong opportunities to put money to work in floating. We've put a little bit of money to work in
fixed. And with the backup in rates that we've seen here, particularly over the last month, a few opportunities have
presented themselves. So, we'll be thoughtful about putting on the right mix in that portfolio. We will have $400
million to $600 million of portfolio churn every quarter. And so, we're looking at that portfolio and constantly
reoptimizing the position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey. Good afternoon.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Yeah. Just sticking with the capital observation or discussion you've referenced in the past that you're not
in the business of warehousing capital, but we've seen it grow consecutively over the last few quarters and no
buyback this quarter. What other – with the expectation for growth where it is, what else could we expect in terms
of capital management out of you if we're not going to see the buyback here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, our first and highest priority is to be there for our customers and to meet their needs. And we've
seen relatively slower loan growth than we might have otherwise desired, but that will continue to be our growth
priority. Second priority would always be a competitive dividend, and I think we will be very thoughtful as we
approach yearend and into next year about where that should go given our outlook.
Third, as we consider non-organic opportunities from time to time, and we'll continue to have some dry powder to
explore those, if and when appropriate. And lastly, we'll do the buyback. And we'll continue to be very patient and
thoughtful and diligent about how we approach that, and make sure that we're making the right call on the first
three before putting money to work in the fourth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And then, on the deposit side, you've had a lot of success growing, growing time.
And it sounds like the pricing on the new offerings is working in your favor. Is there a sort of a maximum
percentage of deposits you'd like to see time deposits or you're happy to get the money in the door here at these
prices?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we looked at the opportunity to bring the money in earlier in the year during our lunar campaign special as
the opportunity. And I would, at the risk of Dominic, writing me a further negative note in my year review, we went
out a little higher than he was comfortable with at 5.25% with the idea that we'd be able to roll that down the curve
8


East West Bancorp, Inc.

at lower price points through the year. I would note that we're seeing good retention on those new deposits that
we brought in from those customers this year, and we're rolling them over today at 4.28%. And so, despite the
fact that the Fed has only cut 50 basis points, our CD pricing has essentially dropped prospectively by 100 basis
points already, and we'll continue to feed positively.
So, I think our timing of that was bring them in early, roll down the curve as the Fed moves, and that seems to be
working in our favor right now.

Good afternoon, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, I guess, maybe just following up on loan growth, like I was looking back, since 2015, loan growth C&I or
consolidated has been about 8% to 10%. Would love to hear your thoughts, maybe Chris and maybe if Dominic, if
you could share a perspective from a client standpoint, once we get out of the elections, does it feel like we return
back to that high-single-digit loan growth for East West next year, if the economy continues to kind of progress as
it has over the last 6 to 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, from our...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. From the bank's perspective, we have plenty of capital that we just talked about, Chris just mentioned
earlier. So, we have all the flexibility to do what the clients sort of demand. Well, we'll see how the election goes,
Right. And so, right now, I mean, I think it will be unwise for me to make too much of a prediction because since,
like all the media calling for a close race, and we don't even know the race will finish in one day or not. So, in that
standpoint, I think that what our position is that East West just got to take care of East West business, and in the
9


East West Bancorp, Inc.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
way that we always positioned ourselves with a fortress-like balance sheet and very strong cushion in terms of
our capital. And we have great customers that we work with.
And when the opportunity arise, that call for higher demand of loans from our customers, obviously we'll respond,
and naturally then, we'll have a higher loan growth rate. But if for some reason the economic condition is still kind
of like a little bit muddy and then make it difficult for customers to function and make capital investment or trying to
accelerate growth, we naturally will slow down a bit. So, I think what happened this year, I would say, is
somewhat unusual to the normal East West Bank loan growth pattern this year. Our customers are holding off.
And you can see it in the utilization rate. We normally add about 70%-plus and drop to 67% in this quarter, and
that's 300 basis point of difference.
So, if customer continue to be concerned about whatever uncertainty there's out there that caused them to not
wanting to draw down the loans, and then I think our loan growth would not be strong. But what we noticed is that
despite these reduction in loan utilization, East West still find a way to grow our C&I loans, because we're adding
new customers. We continue to add new customers. We're confident in 2025, we'll continue to add new
customers. But in terms of our existing customers, whether they will do a bit more drawdown or not, I think that
we'll have to wait to see how the economy goes, and then whatever circumstances dictate what they would do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And to further on that, maybe I'll just note we've seen commitments continue to grow. In fact, commitments grew
2% this quarter in a period where we only grew end-of-period and average loans 1%. So, we grew commitments
faster than outstandings, echoing the point that Dominic made about utilization trends. But if we look year-over-
year, it's actually up 9%. And so, the reality is our customers have continued to engage with us. They've
continued to come to us to talk about opportunities. They've continued to put credit in place. They just haven't
pulled the trigger on it yet. And so, we're optimistic that if the right conditions present themselves, it could be a
good year for us to be ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And, I guess, just the other question around investments. When we look at – I mean, I was looking
at the branch count year-over-year, it's been around 98 and 99, remind us in terms of team hiring, any new
markets or any of your regions on slide 14 where you're adding branches or offices, be it in the United States or
there are opportunities in Greater China.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, we're not currently contemplating opening additional branches in additional markets, and we don't have any
current plans to further or deepen our network across China. We do have a rep office in Singapore that we've
talked about at what point in time it'd be appropriate to upgrade that, but that call hasn't been made, and will be in
the future. But we continuously look at our branch network, and we've done some pruning, and we'll do some
replacements, but we're not entering new markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And if I may follow up, Chris, if I heard you correctly on capital priorities, you did mention non-organic
opportunities. I don't think of East West as super-acquisitive bank. Just talk to us what may make sense. I mean, I
10

know elections might have an impact. But either from a bank standpoint, are there non-bank deals that would also
make sense for the bank? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Last year, the bank made a fairly significant investment in an asset management company. I think those
kind of fee-driven opportunities are always going to be of interest. I think our appetite for depositories is light right
now.

Hi, Timur.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Hi. Just looking back on the deposit conversation, can you maybe just provide us some color
around what the churn is for time deposits in 4Q? And then, Chris, you had made some comments about your
willingness to maybe let some higher cost dollars walk in 4Q if they choose, maybe quantify that statement as
well, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. So, we've got about $8 billion of CDs that'll roll here in the fourth quarter, another $8 billion that'll roll
in the first quarter of 2025, and about another $4 billion behind that in the second quarter of 2025. The rest are
spread out into future periods. We are being very active around anything that's not accretive to what happens if
we take the incremental dollar and put it just in Fed funds. Given that we've got a pretty hefty cash position, it has
to be incrementally accretive. And so, we're not doing anything that's high-4s, frankly, anymore. And we're
continuing to move everything to at or below our CD special rate, which is currently 4.28%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. And then, maybe just looking at fee income, strong quarter in 3Q. I'm just wondering to the
sustainability of those results, is there anything that was maybe rate-driven, where the frenzied last month drove
some of those higher revenue per user? Is that $84 million, $85 million level? Is that a good run rate here in the
near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think the core fee business number has benefited from a lot of trends. Rate volatility has helped
some cases on the engagements with our rates teams. The positive markets have facilitated some great but
11

focused sales efforts by our wealth management teams. So, those dynamics are real. But obviously, if the market
conditions change, that could soften. But nonetheless, we're pleased by the efforts of our sales teams, and we
would largely ascribe it to good and focused sales efforts that have driven our results here over the last couple of
quarters, which have both been record quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I do want to point out that the fee incomes growth, wealth management, private banking, these fees, obviously,
maybe rate environment do have something to do with equity market situation. But I will say for the East West
Bank situation is relatively less influenced by the rate environment. And obviously, you can see it in the line items
on our earnings release, which shows that depository fee income continue to grow from cash management side
and also foreign exchange. And then so, it's really hitting in all the areas.
And from the loan side, mainly some syndication fees when we need syndication. So, those are really our efforts
that I would say more that we are very pleased with these kind of like incremental growth, and we expect that we'll
continue to work on these areas, whether it's cash management, treasury management services that we provide
to sophisticated clients for their operating accounts or the foreign exchanges services that we offer, and interest
rate hedge, plus continue to be the lead lender to do more syndication. These are things that all are important for
East West Bank in order to help us to continue to have meaningful sort of core banking growth in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then, maybe one last one for Irene. It looks like commercial real estate non-performers declined pretty
nicely in 3Q. But then, if you look at the allowance build, the all other CRE line that actually ticked up quite a bit,
I'm just wondering what drove that incremental reserve build?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, well, first I would just want to clarify, the allowance doesn't just warrant necessarily non-accrual loans or
substandard loans. The drivers for those as far as the allowance and mix shift, there, we do still have a fair
amount of qualitative factors, not just the quantitative. And we look at it from the perspective of, is there enough
coverage, regionally are there things that we're looking at, et cetera. So, not necessarily something very specific
related to one loan, just from more broad base. But overall, for the real estate portfolio in specific, as far as the
loan portfolio, it's something that we continue to actively monitor. But overall, we're comfortable as far as the
grading, the allowance level, and just overall how we're monitoring the portfolio.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Can you remind us or update us on what deposit beta you're assuming for this easing cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. We've assumed to-date that would have a 50% or better beta, which seems to materialize for us here over
the last several weeks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Through this cycle. Not obviously initially, but through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, just on your adjusted non-interest expense growth, going to be in that 6% to 8% range this
year, any reason to believe that might slow or should we assume you kind of sustain that level of growth as you
march toward becoming $100 billion in assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we continue to look at that. Obviously, we'll go and have some conversations with the board here about
budgets and outlooks for next year, and it'll be somewhat growth dependent. But I would continue to expect that
we will continue to make the investments we need to be the bank that we want to be. And that will be probably a
slightly faster spend rate than longer-term historical averages.
But again, I would remind folks that 6% to 8% off a 37% base is a lot less than that kind of growth off a 60%
efficiency ratio or something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Oh, great. Chris, coming back to the NII for a moment, I mean, it feels like NII should be flat to up in the fourth
quarter. I guess what would it take for NII to be down in Q4?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Look, it depends on how many rate cuts there are. At this point, I think the yield curve was assuming at quarter-
end, 2%. We are asset sensitive. That would put downward pressure. We're assuming we're going to have asset
growth that will positively offset that, and get us to something better than down. And that's what we're shooting
for. But the function is if Fed surprised us with 50 basis points, we're probably not going to get there. With another
50 basis points, that's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A

On top of it. Yeah. So.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, we see November and December 20 tides like in kind of orderly fashion, that would support perhaps NII
growth in the fourth quarter is what you're saying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Orderly to small, modest Fed cuts as were sort of projected at quarter-end, and that we're very responsive as we
were on managing deposit costs lower, and that we see asset growth puts us in the right frame for a good
outcome. And if we fall short of that, you'll see it in January. But I think we feel pretty good about where we're
heading.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Got it. Thanks for that. And then, maybe just broadly on $100 billion, you guys have really made a dent on the
HQLA. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about the all-in costs as you – I know you've got several years,
but how you're thinking about just planning in the overall P&L? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, you're right. We have plenty of time. But on the other hand, we do not wait. We've been working towards –
at one point, and I don't know when, but at some point, we're going to be over $100 billion. I mean, one, that's a
fact that we will be over $100 billion. It's just that when. So, our position is that we will continue to just work in a
rational way to build up all the appropriate infrastructure that is needed to be at that level. So, our senior
executives are well-aware of the rules and the criteria. And what we have currently that already met the
requirement of what we potentially have a gap, and what kind of resources that we need to field in, both human
resources and also technology or infrastructure resources, et cetera.
So, we are in a very disciplinary manner, and working towards the goal of, at some point, we'll be ready. And the
likelihood is that – well, it's not just likelihood, we will be ready before we turn into a $100 billion. That's the
position.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I was wondering, Chris, I think you gave the CD balances for 4Q, Q1, and beyond. I was curious if you'd be willing
to give the rates. The only reason I ask is because, I think, you have a little bit of pig in the pipe on Lunar New
Year, and if I'm recalling it correct, it was a 5.25%, six month, so it goes kind of 1Q, 3Q, 1Q. And so, seven 1Q is
kind of at the 5% like if we do two cuts, I think, is there a reasonable expectation to kind of see roughly 100 basis
points lower on CD pricing in 1Q, assuming we get another 25 basis points-25 basis points from the Fed?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think as we look forward, Ben, what we have observed in Q3 is that we got roughly about 100-
basis-point savings in Q3 versus what we did in Q1. So, that's there. And your question is will we potentially see
something similar as we roll into first quarter? Look, I think we'll see how the yield curve shapes out. We're
benefiting today from the fact that the forwards have got those next two rate cuts priced in. So, if we get to the first
quarter and there's still additional cuts priced in, which the yield curve says there may be, we'll probably see that
kind of savings again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. Okay. So, it's kind of at the same time, you also see the swap [ph] hedging reprieve (00:36:00). That's a
positive for sure. When you think about just kind of client conversations, a lot of banks have kind of been – for
most of the year, they're positive on growth, and then walked it back because of growth didn't materialize. Are
your clients saying anything in terms of, like, a catalyst point on rates? I know you talked through a couple of silos.
Are we looking for just another 50 basis points at the start of the calendar next year? Are people pointing to
anything specifically that kind of might spark an inflection higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I mean, there's really no – I mean, clients are not in this line of business that we are. So, they don't think
about these sort of like a Fed fund rate all the time. But it's really – and also it's a mixed bag of people from all
different industries. So, everyone have their own view. It's just, in general, rate. As we looked at two months ago,
and then even today, it's still relatively high. And so, we do expect that when by just conversation with our
different customers from different industries that with rate being where it is, makes it a little bit difficult for them to
make substantial investments or maybe acquisition and whatnot.
And then, also with rate being where it is right now, other than folks that are really good at distressed asset that
look into commercial real estate opportunities, I would say, by and large, a lot of the traditional real estate
investors that are not in the distressed category, they may not necessarily feel this is the right time to make
acquisition. And so, all in all, I would say that that's what just overall in the whole banking industry, the lending
side has been – the demand of the loans has slowed down a bit.
But we'll see how it goes. As long as there is indication from the Fed that they will continue to drop rate, and not
necessarily abruptly in a big way, they just do 25 basis point, 25 basis point, and then continue to make X number
of cuts next year, and I do believe that that sort of message would most likely cause many business to start
picking up, and have the confidence to move forward.

Hey. Good afternoon.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Sam.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Chris, on the 4.28% CD specials that you mentioned, were those six-month specials?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, just on the beta, if I'm sort of looking at the commentary you gave on the past 9/30
progress you've made on deposit costs, I guess I kind of get to like a 40% quarter-to-date beta on total deposits.
Given the maturities you laid out for the next three quarters here on CDs, is there one quarter where the step-
down between the roll and roll-off rates is such that you expect to make sort of a bigger step-up in the cycle to the
betas, or should we expect more of a gradual path towards the 50% mark that you laid out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think it's more of a gradual path. And again, the 50% beta through the cycle feels very achievable based on what
we're seeing here in the first rate cut. But that'll be proven out with the next couple. But I think we're comfortable
that that's a good guidepost for now, and that will be fairly gradual and consistent, assuming the Fed, as Dominic
just said, is sort of 25, 25, 25 kind of cut path.

5-ish for total, 10-ish for interest-bearing or closer to 5 basis point for total, closer to 10 basis point for interest-
bearing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Easy enough. Okay. And then, the $10 million positive impact from the swap rolling off, is that prior
to rate cuts? Does it assume or make an assumption around kind of the forward curve or is it just as is kind of
today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That was kind of the end of quarter number, right. So, we've seen the first $50 million. I think if you'd asked me
that in August, I would have cited a number closer to $12 million. And so, it comes down, and it'll come down a
little bit. It'll get chipped away at with each Fed action, but it'll still largely roll [indiscernible] (00:41:12).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
