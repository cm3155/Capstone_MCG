Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 2. Before I hand it over to Clark to review our
financial results, I want to provide my perspective on a quarter that represented significant progress for Key as we
position ourselves for the future. First, we received the initial $821 million, a little less than one-third of the
anticipated minority investment from Scotiabank at the end of August. We used approximately $700 million of the
proceeds to reposition our securities portfolio. In retrospect, this trade was fortuitously-timed. Long-dated
securities were sold near recent bond market highs in mid-September, which enabled us to sell over $7 billion of
market value securities out of a total available-for-sale portfolio of $37 billion.
At this point, we have fully invested the proceeds at better than anticipated yields in more liquid, less capital-
intensive, shorter duration agency MBS. We anticipate these actions will add over $40 million to quarterly net
interest income in the fourth quarter. As for the remainder of the $2.8 billion Scotiabank minority investment, we
are now through the public comment period, and we continue to expect to receive regulatory approval by the first
quarter of 2025.
Secondly, we saw the long-anticipated step-up in our net interest income this quarter, up 7% quarter-over-quarter.
This reflected a combination of a more meaningful amount of low-yielding short-term swaps and treasuries
maturing, as well as proactive management of our funding costs. We also continue to grow our client deposits, up
4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. We achieved this NII growth despite some near-term impact as a result
of the Fed's 50-basis-point rate cut in mid-September. We mitigated a portion of the cut through a very proactive
and disciplined deposit repricing plan, which is a testament to the preparedness of our consumer and commercial
deposit teams. As a result, our beta in the initial Fed cut is anticipated to be higher than we had previously
modeled and communicated.
Thirdly, we continue to see strong momentum across our most important fee-based organic growth initiatives.
Investment banking and debt placement fees were very strong at $171 million, one of the best third quarters in
our history. Activity was broad-based with volumes particularly robust across loan syndications as well as debt
and equity originations. Pipelines remained at historically elevated levels, despite the third quarter pull-through.
Pipelines are stable compared to June 30th levels and up meaningfully compared to yearend and year-ago levels.
M&A backlogs, which we have said in the past have a 2 to 3 times multiplier effect, were near-record levels and
up 10% compared to the prior quarter. At this point, I am confident we will hit the high end of our full year target
for investment banking fees of $600 million to $650 million, with an opportunity to exceed the high end if our
pipelines pull through prior to yearend, again, assuming markets remain hospitable.
In commercial payments, leveraging our focus on primacy, commercial deposits were up 5% year-over-year and
2% sequentially. As a reminder, 93% of these balances are tied to an operating account. Underlying core treasury
service activities remain strong, growing in the low-double-digits. We believe we are well-positioned in this area to
benefit as rates continue to decline. Our third-party commercial mortgage servicing business posted a record
quarter due to a small portfolio acquisition over the summer.
Additionally, active special servicing balances reached a record $7.5 billion. As a reminder, this is a
countercyclical [ph] office (00:05:48) business that also provides us with unique insights into the commercial real
estate market. We are currently seeing high rates of transfers into special servicing concentrated in office and, to
a lesser extent, multifamily, even as we have also seen resolutions accelerate as we move through the year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
In wealth, assets under management reached an all-time high of $61 billion, up 16% from the prior year. Sales
production was a record this quarter and we are on track for a record year. While the entire wealth business is
performing well, we continue to see particularly strong traction in our mass affluent segment. This quarter, we
enrolled an additional 5,000 households and added $620 million of assets to the platform. In only 18 months, we
have added over 36,000 households and about $3.6 billion of new household assets to Key. As a reminder, over
1 million of Key's retail households have investable assets of over $250,000, and only about 10% have an existing
investment relationship with us. So, there remains a significant opportunity to continue to grow in the mass
affluent segment.
Lastly, with respect to credit, we continue to demonstrate a conservative derisked credit profile. Nonperforming
assets and loans as well as provision for credit losses were essentially flat. Net charge-offs, as expected, were up
and reflected a few specific C&I credits that were known and had been mostly reserved against. Importantly,
criticized loans declined by $132 million. We also saw a marked improvement in our net credit upgrades to
downgrades trends which, while still slightly negative, moved back to our trailing 13-quarter average. We believe
that NPLs are peaking and criticized loans will continue to decline from current levels.
In summary, I am proud of the significant progress we made as a company this quarter. We announced the
strategic minority investment from Scotiabank, closing on the initial one-third tranche a few weeks later. We
deployed most of that successfully completing one-half of our anticipated securities portfolio restructuring. At the
same time, we continue to drive broad-based momentum across the franchise, grew our pipelines, delivered the
first meaningful leg of the uplift in net interest income that we've been communicating over the past year, and took
proactive actions across the deposit books to prepare ourselves for the rate cuts, all while continuing to
demonstrate a strong credit risk profile. As a result, despite the one-time impact of the restructuring, we improved
our CET1 ratio this quarter by another 35 basis points to 10.8%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Clark to provide more details on our financial results.

Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm now on slide 4. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per
share of negative $0.47, including $0.77 impact from the previously disclosed securities portfolio repositioning.
Excluding the repositioning, EPS was $0.30 per share. As Chris mentioned, in mid-September, we sold roughly
$7 billion market value of mostly long-dated CMOs and CMBS, which had a weighted average yield of about 2.3%
and an average duration of almost six years. And at this point, we've reinvested all of the proceeds, mostly in
October, when we saw term rates rise by 30 to 40 basis points. As a result, we will see roughly 260 basis points
yield pick-up on approximately $7 billion of securities starting in the fourth quarter. The new securities will also
provide liquidity and capital benefits relative to what was previously owned. As a reminder, we currently
contemplate doing a similar magnitude repositioning upon receiving the second tranche of the Scotiabank
investment, assuming we get that approval.
Reported revenue was down approximately 55% sequentially and from the prior year, but excluding the securities
repositioning, revenue was up 6% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year, with growth across both net interest
income and fees. Expenses remained well controlled, down 1% compared to the prior year, a little better than we
previously expected. This implies about 400 basis points of positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis
excluding the securities portfolio repositioning. Credit costs were essentially flat to the second quarter and
included a $60 million release of our allowance for credit losses, reflecting primarily three charge-off credits that
had specific reserve allocations held against them as well as lower loan balances. Our Common Equity Tier 1
ratio increased to 10.8% and tangible book value increased nearly 16% sequentially.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Moving to the balance sheet on slide 5. Average loans declined 2.5% sequentially to $106 billion and ended the
quarter just above $105 billion. The decline reflects continued tepid client demand, flat utilization rates, our
disciplined approach as to what we're willing to put on the balance sheet, and the intentional runoff of low-yielding
consumer loans as they pay down and mature. Additionally, we built the business to be able to serve clients with
on- and off-balance sheet solutions, whichever works best for them. This quarter, we raised $28 billion of capital
for our clients, and as Chris mentioned, we had a very strong quarter of investment banking fees. At the end of
the third quarter, we warehoused approximately $600 million of loans for commercial clients that you can see in
loans held for sale. Additionally, throughout the quarter, we refinanced about $300 million of CRE loans off our
balance sheet into permanent mortgages through our Capital Markets Group. We continue to have active
dialogue with clients and prospects, and our loan pipelines continue to build.
On slide 6, average deposits increased 2.5% sequentially to nearly $148 billion, reflecting growth across
consumer and commercial deposits. Client deposits were up about 4% year-over-year as we managed broker
deposits down by roughly $2.2 billion from year-ago levels. Reported noninterest-bearing deposits declined 1% to
19% of total deposits, and when adjusted for noninterest-bearing deposits in our hybrid accounts, this percentage
remained flat linked-quarter at 24%. Both total and interest-bearing deposit costs increased by 11 basis points
during the quarter, 7 basis points of the increase reflected reduction of roughly $4.5 billion of FHLB funding,
yielding almost 5.6%, that was replaced with lower cost client deposits. Our overall interest-bearing costs
increased just 1 basis point this quarter.
As Chris mentioned, we've been proactive across our deposit book in preparation for the Fed easing cycle that we
all anticipated would begin last month. Ahead of the cut, we shortened CD tenors` and took promo rates down,
and on the commercial side, we moved significant amount of deposits into indexed accounts. Following the cut,
we took rates down further across both front- and back-book in consumer. In commercial, we effectively passed
along the majority of the cut to clients. Our deposit beta on the first rate cut is expected to be low- to mid-30s,
which would benefit our fourth quarter net interest income.
Moving to net interest income and the margin on slide 7. Tax-equivalent net interest income was $964 million, up
7%, or $65 million, and the net interest margin increased 13 basis points from the prior quarter. Our well-
communicated net interest income opportunity is now providing more benefit as the greater portion of low-yielding
short-term swaps and treasuries mature. Scotiabank investment and our mid-September securities portfolio
reposition added roughly $12 million and about 2 basis points to third quarter NII and NIM, respectively.
Turning to slide 8. Reported noninterest income was negative $269 million and included a $918 million loss
related to the securities repositioning as well as a $14 million Visa-related charge. Adjusting for those items,
noninterest income was up 3% year-over-year. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased over 20%
from the prior year and 36% from the prior quarter, reflecting a strong quarter for syndication, debt, and equity
underwriting fees.
Commercial mortgage servicing had a record quarter, reflecting higher active special servicing balances and
growth in the overall portfolio. At September 30, we serviced about $690 billion of assets on behalf of third-party
clients, including about $230 billion of special servicing, $7.5 billion of which was in active special servicing. Given
the lumpiness in some of these fees and as interest rates come down, we would expect fourth quarter commercial
mortgage servicing fees to look more like the second quarter. Trust and investment services fees grew 8% year-
over-year as assets under management grew to a record level of $61 billion.

On slide 9, second quarter noninterest expenses were $1.09 billion, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and down 1%
year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower fraud losses,
marketing expenses, and a modest reduction in the estimated FDIC special assessment charge. Sequentially, the
increase was driven by higher incentive compensation from stronger investment banking fees.
Moving to slide 10. Credit quality remained solid. Net charge-offs were $154 million, or 58 basis points of average
loans, and 90-day delinquencies ticked up a few basis points. Net charge-offs were elevated due to three credits,
two consumer goods companies and one equipment manufacturer, that were largely reserved. Nonperforming
loans and assets were essentially stable, up 2.5% and 2%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter. NPAs as a
percentage of loans remain low at 70 basis points. Criticized loans declined by 2% in the third quarter, reflecting
lower rates and increased loan modifications with credit enhancements. We believe NPAs are peaking and
criticized loans will continue to decline from here, assuming no material macro deterioration.
Turning to slide 11. We continue to build our capital position with the CET1 ratio up 35 basis points to 10.8% as of
September 30th. Our marked CET1 ratio, which includes unrealized AFS and pension losses, improved nearly
130 basis points to 8.6%. Our AOCI improved by about $1.9 billion to negative $3.3 billion at quarter end,
reflecting lower interest rates and the securities reposition in mid-September. We expect AOCI to further improve
by about one-third by yearend 2025 and about 40% by yearend 2026, with approximately half of that improvement
reflecting a second contemplated securities portfolio repositioning once the full investment from Scotiabank
closes.
Slide 12 provides our outlook for full year 2024 relative to 2023. We currently expect net interest income to fall in
the middle of the full year guidance range of down 2% to 5%, albeit, with about 150 basis points of positive impact
from the Scotiabank investment and the securities portfolio restructuring this past month. Net interest margin
should come in around 2.4% for the fourth quarter. We are tweaking our yearend loan forecast by 1% to down 5%
to 6%. We are also positively revising our average deposit guidance to up 1% to 2%, including expectations for
client deposits to grow by 3% to 4%.
We now expect fees, excluding this past quarter's securities portfolio restructuring, to grow 6% or better this year,
depending on how the capital markets environment plays out in the fourth quarter. Given the strong fee
momentum and our higher stock price, we expect expenses to be up approximately 2% this year. This also
includes the funding of our charitable foundation. As we previously communicated, we expect the full year net
charge-off ratio to be closer to the high end of the 30- to 40-basis-point range, given lower loan balances than we
had expected coming into the year. For the full year, we expect provision for credit losses to come in around $400
million, which is unchanged from what we had expected back in January.
Moving to slide 13. The last time we are updating the net interest income opportunity from swaps and short-dated
treasuries maturing as we sold the remaining roughly $3 billion of treasuries yielding 50 basis points that were to
mature in the fourth quarter at the end of September, meaning, we now expect the final chunk of benefit from this
opportunity to come in the fourth quarter. The cumulative annualized opportunity ended up being about $830
million, of which 80% has been achieved to date.
Finally, on slide 14, we've laid out for you the path of how we intend to get from the $964 million of reported net
interest income in the third quarter to the fourth quarter exit rate that we had targeted at the beginning of the year.
Regardless of whether the Fed cuts 50 or 75 basis points in the fourth quarter, we believe fourth quarter NII will
be at least 10% higher year-over-year, which equates to $1.020 billion or better in the fourth quarter. We expect
about $40 million of incremental benefit from the September portfolio restructuring and initial tranche investment

from Scotiabank. We expect another $50 million or so of benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, including from the
accelerated sale of short-term treasuries I just described.
We also think we can drive a modest amount of commercial loan growth and some further funding optimization,
offset by some short-term impact from the expected Fed rate cuts. While fewer cuts would be better for fourth
quarter NII, that is largely a timing impact, keep in mind that we would expect to capture more benefit of any rate
cut over the ensuing 6 to 12 months and rate cuts would likely provide benefits to other parts of our business,
such as higher client transaction activity or demand for credit and improvements to capital.
With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator, who will provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Clark, I think you might have touched on this – hey, you might have touched on this a bit towards the end of your
remarks, but there has been so much movement in your balance sheet over the last 90 days, not only the new
capital and the repositioning, but now it looks like the funding profile is starting to look a little different with the
improved deposits outlook as well. Maybe just some thoughts on the updated rate sensitivity of the company as a
whole, and as you look at things, what would be sort of best and worst that you would like just in terms of what
happens with the rate path.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Hey. Good morning, Scott. Thank you. So, look, we've been moving towards rate sensitivity, that's obviously often
viewed over kind of a 12-month period, so the – as all of us in the industry have talked about, the early cuts take a
little bit of time to work their way through, particularly on the deposit side. As we noted, we took a little bit more
deposit action than we had previously planned. Beta is kind of low-30s or so, which we were very happy with, and
we think over the course of 2025, we'll be able to get back to more standard beta paths over time.
I think, on the overall rate profile, look, I think the best version of the world is the one we appear to be headed in,
if a soft landing is coming, which is a steepening curve right now. We got some rally in the term rates, so nearing
again 4%. We all think the front-end is coming down, so something that's flat to upward sloping I think is the best

profile for all of us. But on the flip side, I think, we took some actions, as you noted, in getting out of higher cost
wholesale funding. We funded that with deposits at a lower cost. We feel really good about that deposit base and
the customer profile. We feel good about our ability to price that over time. And given that the swaps positions are
coming off, we feel better just about our overall rate sensitivity.
The other point I'd make is, we had a little bit of concern on the repositioning early, just given the amount of cash
we thought we'd be holding for potentially an extended period of time. Obviously, that cash is pretty asset-
sensitive. So, if those rates come down, that impacts us. And we were able to get all of that into the market in the
last few weeks when rate – those term rates did rally and we did it at better than expected value. So, that's
obviously going to help our rate sensitivity position going forward and we put that – those proceeds in kind of
4.90%, 4.95% range in a duration that's just under four years. So, we felt very good about that repositioning and
that will – again, that will aid us going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Perfect. All right. Thank you for that color. And then, sort of a related one. I think, last month, you all had
discussed an NII improvement next year in kind of the 20-percent-plus range. I think that was before you were
fully invested, because if I'm recalling the timing correctly, that was when you just announced the repositioning.
So, the actual investment is probably a little better than you thought, which presumably should be helpful. But I
guess, the thrust of the question is just we still thinking 20-percent-plus NII improvement next year, and maybe
just if you can expand a little on sort of the main puts and takes to get there in your mind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, I'm going to start with a couple qualifiers, because I feel like that's necessary. The first being...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
...a constructive macro environment kind of soft landing as folks expect. So, that's point one. Point two is, we're in
the middle of planning for next year. So, we'll give our full guidance here in January. But on the 20%, I'd say,
roughly half of that we think comes from the incremental impact of the repositioning. So, assuming – and this
would be the other qualifier, assuming the second leg of this gets approved and we can do the repositioning early
in 2025, so we can get the full year impact of that, we think about half of that lift comes from the complete
repositioning at completion. So, that's part of it.
The other components would be, continued fixed price – fixed asset price – repricing through the course of the
year, and that's a combination of some swaps, not the ones we've been talking about, but some additional swaps
still at rates kind of below 2%. We've got a consumer book that's running down at rates like 3%. And then, we've
got some other fixed rate securities that are a little bit higher that won't be as valuable as they would have been
previously with rates coming down, but we do have some continued opportunity there. And then, the last piece –
the last two pieces, and I'll finish with the most important one, we do have at this point, and again, subject to
change as we get through our planning process, relatively a view on relative stability of loans through 2025, but
recall that that is a mixing of consumer coming down and being replaced with commercial. So, we will need some

commercial growth, not Herculean efforts, but something. Our pipelines would tell us that that should be coming,
but in fairness, it's been telling us that for a quarter or two. So, we'll see how that transpires.
And then, the most important piece is just continued ability to manage betas. We've talked a lot about how the
commercial book is positioned. We've actually improved that throughout the year, getting more deposits into
indexed. We think the use of our hybrid accounts and the treasury – core treasury services that are covered by
deposits there will be a benefit as well. And we've taken some action in the consumer book that would give us
confidence that we can get betas to the right level throughout the course of 2025. So, all those components kind
of make up the other half of the 20%, and at this point, we feel good that that's achievable, but we owe you a
more detailed explanation when we come back in January.

Chris, you talk about recent M&A backlogs are up 10% quarter-over-quarter, and what's the change now and why
– and we've seen this at the big players. And also, we've heard there's a little debate, is the capital markets
activity taking away from loan growth or are they – I'm sorry, are you seeing some disintermediation from lending
to capital markets as it relates to KeyCorp? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well, thanks for your question. I think the fundamental difference is the private equity universe is really
starting to transact. I think they have a perspective. Obviously, there's an inverse relationship between the hold
period and the returns. And in addition to that, with the tenure, which is really what matters, sort of settling in
somewhere around 4%, that's in an environment where I think the private equity world is very comfortable
transacting. And as a consequence, I think you're really starting to see a pick-up on the M&A side, and I think that
will continue by the way.

With respect to the disintermediation, there's no question that it is. I mean, you know, Mike, we raised $28 billion
last quarter and we have a pretty good eye on this, because we're distributing a lot of paper in a lot of places, and
there's no question in my mind that some of the capital markets activity does, in fact, disintermediate the banks,
and I think the private capital – private credit markets do as well, and of course, we distribute paper to all those
places.

And the only thing I might add to that, Mike, just a couple specific examples and we touched on this, but about
$0.5 billion of loans we put directly into our warehouse, they're on their way to the markets, and then another
$300 million, we refinanced off the balance sheet into the market. So, that's always been our model and we'll
continue to do what makes the most sense for clients, and I think you saw that this quarter in our strong
investment banking fees.

And just to follow up on the private equity comment, you said the private equity universe is starting to transact. I
got the sense they're deploying some of the dry powder, but not necessarily monetizing the investments, but you
get different stories depending on who you ask. How much of your business is driven by private equity and how
do you see the private equity factor playing out, because you've never had this much dry powder in a cycle like

Sure. So, I think broadly, the private equity universe represents about a third of all the fees that are paid in the
investment banking arena. Our mix wouldn't be much different, and your observation is good in that the private
equity firms that are putting product out into the market, that's a process that takes 12 months or so, as opposed
to buying businesses that are available, which is relatively – there's a shorter timeline on that.
Thanks for your questions, Mike.

Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Chris, you mentioned in your opening remarks about the special servicing. I was curious or piqued my interest,
you mentioned how there seems to be an accelerated resolution to the inflows that may have come in six months
ago or three months ago. Can you give us any color on how that resolution is going? Is it big price discounts and
then being refinanced or what are your guys seeing on the resolution side to move these properties out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, it's a combination of things, Gerard. If you go to the office market, frankly, there's just some capitulation,
because there has to be, and things are starting to trade, albeit, at a significant discount. Not a lot of new capital
coming in, frankly, to the office market. I can speak to that in greater depth in a moment. On the other hand, with
respect to multifamily, and we've said before, most of the multifamily projects that are in special servicing are
concentrated in the Southeast. Most of them, frankly, are not financed by banks, most of them were done
relatively recently with some very aggressive assumptions, i.e., trending rates, having sub-debt in them, et cetera.
In those instances, we are able to attract new capital on a restructuring basis. So, it's a little bit different for office
vis-à-vis multifamily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, you guys talked about the outlook for loans or what you're experiencing in loans, and we're
seeing from the H.8 data that comes out on Fridays that it seems like commercial and industrial loans have hit a
bottom and are starting to creep up a bit. Any sense that you might be seeing that soon as well or is it just some
of your – where you're physically located and your customers is still going to be flat for – or flat to down, I should
say, over the near-term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, there's a few things going on, and first of all, we are, without question, growing clients. So, there is no doubt
that we're out there bringing on new clients. We have been, obviously, a bit frustrated by the lack of take-up of our
existing clients in terms of borrowing money, and I think what's going on, Gerard, is a few things. On the positive
side, I mentioned to Mike, there is transactional finance happening, so that's a positive. On the negative side, you
just have supply significantly exceeding demand. On the demand side, here is some of the things that we need to
see before we get significant growth from our existing customers. One, there hasn't been a lot of investment in
CapEx, and that has typically a lead time of about 18 months based on all the uncertainties.
The next thing is, utilization, and this one is a complex one. Everyone basically went long on inventory during the
pandemic, because there was a lot of inflation and there were supply chain issues. Now, people are getting back
to really managing their working capital. And I assume, obviously, rising rates has something to do with that as
well. So, I think there's just been a fundamental adjustment there. So, we do see it coming back. We see it
coming back first on the transaction side. We'll see it next, I think, on our clients engaging in CapEx. And I think
the last piece that will happen is to really get a kick in utilization, because for all the reasons I just described,

these companies are throwing off a fair amount of cash as they get sort of top line decline and all the other things
in the mix.
Does that answer your question, Gerard?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No. It does. Thank you. That's good, Chris. And just one real quick, you guys in the past have always had a
comment or two on student lending. Any changes here and with rates coming down a bit on your student lending
platform?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, that is an upside for us, and as rates continue to come down, we basically had a negligible amount of
originations in the last quarter in our student loan business. We think a decline of 100 to 150 basis points will get
that business back to ramping up. To state the obvious, every quarter, every semester, there is a bunch of new
customers at different levels, but clearly, with the hiking cycle, it's going to take a while to work through that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
And we're still peeling off the moratorium. So, people are just getting – used to paying their student loans again or
maybe not yet used to paying their student loans again. So, there's probably a little bit of transition in just seeing
that sticker shock a little bit, and then going out and figuring out if there's a better alternative.

Hey, everyone. This is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. So, you talked about the rise in C&I net charge-

Nathan Stein Q

I wanted to ask, what industries were these loans in? And we saw the updated charge-off guidance for full year
2024, but are you expecting other similarly sized losses in the coming quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Nathan, this is Chris. So, the – specifically, the three credits, two of them were in consumer products, one of them
was in equipment manufacturing, having nothing to do with consumer products. So, those were the three credits,
each had their own idiosyncratic issues that I don't think you can get a huge read-through on broad industries on
those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then, if I could just ask a question on the NIM. You flagged a 2.40% level in 4Q, just given
all the moving pieces. I think, in September, you guys had flagged a 3% NIM with a – just assuming a steeper
yield curve down the road, not necessarily next year. But could you provide your updated thoughts on the long-
term NIM, just given the move in rates over the past few weeks and everything else going on at Key? Thanks.

Clark H. I. Khayat A

Well, Nathan, I think from a broad perspective, what we've said is – and there's, obviously, a bunch of puts and
takes in this. We said that, based on our business model, there is no reason, by the end of 2025, we can't be in a
range of 2.8% to 3%, and obviously, we're looking at different models every single day, but we still feel very
comfortable with that.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Zach on for Erika. My question is just around deposit betas. We saw a decent uptick in
the cost of interest-bearing deposits this quarter. I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking
about the trajectory for that deposit beta going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Sure. So, maybe just get to the quarter movement first and then transition to beta. So, up 11 basis points
interest-bearing deposit costs in the quarter, 7 basis points of that was an intentional move into higher cost
deposits, but deposits that were lower cost than wholesale funding. So, we paid off about $4.5 billion of FHLB
advances at a higher rate, and I think the more important number versus the 11 basis points on deposit costs is
overall funding costs only up 1 basis point. So, at the end of the day, what we're managing is the overall funding
costs, and obviously, deposits are a critical part of that.
As it relates to betas, we had expected something in the maybe low- to mid-20s on the first cuts. We are
expecting to be closer to low- to mid-30s potentially. Some of that is we just leaned into different portfolios a little
bit more aggressively than we thought we could, because we felt comfortable that we understood the dynamics of
those. The other piece is the 50-basis-point cut in September gave us a little bit more room to take action. If that
had been 25 basis points, I think you would have seen a lower beta on that first cut. So, as we say pretty
frequently, I think, the not only absolute level of rates, but how much they're moving on any one cut tends to
impact how much beta you can see as a reaction to that. So, the 50 basis points on a net basis creates a little bit
more drag in 2024, but it also gave us the ability to take a little bit more aggressive action on deposit pricing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up to that, on the noninterest-bearing deposit front, any color that you can
share on that in terms of when you think that will reach a bottom there or pivot to growth? Any thoughts there
would be helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, maybe just a reminder there, too. So, our reported number shows down a tick, around 19%. Recall that
we use pretty actively a hybrid account for our commercial clients that has a fair bit of noninterest-bearing
deposits in it. If you adjust for those, which we think is appropriate, you get pretty flat at 24% quarter-to-quarter.
So, I think, in aggregate, it's starting to stabilize. We would expect with rate cuts that it's going to be stable, and if
the rate cuts continue, we would expect it to potentially start to tick up, and some of that is frankly the way those
hybrid accounts work. So, over time, we're thinking this is at or near the bottom of that percentage.

Hey, Manan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. I apologize, if this has already been covered, but can you talk about expenses for 2025? Just given that you
have a lot more capital to work with now, growth should be accelerating next year. You have some investment
spend to make plus you have been pretty good with managing expenses over the past few years. So, just given
all of that, how should we think about expenses in 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Fair question. We're obviously going through the planning cycle now, but I've mentioned before and this
won't change, we will be targeting kind of low- to mid-single-digits for 2025. Our discipline around expenses won't
change in spite of the fact that we're going to, obviously, have a significant amount of capital. You do see in the
fourth quarter and we gave guidance on this that we're investing a little bit in the fourth quarter, and that's really
just some unique opportunities that we have to kind of advance the business in light of the tailwinds that we're
picking up from both the rundown of our swaps and treasuries, and also the repositioning of the balance sheet
that Clark walked everyone through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, the maybe one additional point that I think is embedded in Chris's comment, but I just want to make it
explicitly, Manan, which is we would tell you not to annualize that Q4 number going into 2025, I don't think that's
appropriate. As Chris mentioned, we're leaning into higher fee growth. So, we're going to see incentive comp go
up a bit. Stock price is a little bit higher. We've got some unique investment opportunities we're assessing in the
fourth quarter that we're interested in taking to get a head-start on 2025. But I think the underlying point that Chris
made is worth repeating, which is we don't see the benefit of higher earnings or the investment as a path to losing
our expense discipline here.

Perfect. And then, I appreciate the comments on the near-term deposit betas, but wanted to get your thoughts on
just longer-term, as you think through the cycle, should deposit betas in the way down match deposit betas on the
way up or given that loan growth will be stronger this time than it was when deposit – when rates were going up,
will deposit betas likely be a little bit slower through the cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. It's a great question with no simple answer, because you have a bunch of the moving parts. So, subject to
funding needs on the balance sheet, that obviously drives the requirement to have deposit balances, which in
effect then hit your pricing, what I would say maybe more broadly is, I think the absolute level of rates matter and
the amount of movement in rates matter. So, if we hit kind of peak at mid-50s, 56% I think beta on the way up, I
think that's worth more than probably you would have expected at the beginning of the cycle, but it's also a
function of rates moving up over 500 basis points off of zero. So, your relative starting point is zero, you're moving
up by 500 basis points – 550 basis points, that's a huge move, and you're getting obviously to that 5% level.
I think, on the way down, I would expect it to be somewhat parallel, but probably not getting to the mid-50s,
maybe it's a 50 number, because you're not likely to get back to zero unless some exogenous event occurs. So, if
we hit some terminal rate path that's 2.5%, 3%, I think you're going to see beta deployed, and beta deployed over
time fairly aggressively, but I don't think you get to the same levels just because the magnitude of the change is
50% to 60% of the way up. And then, you have to account for the other element, which is loans and required
balances for funding.

Christopher M. Gorman A

Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. If you're talking to NCOs, Mike, the three credits then, yeah, we don't expect that to recur. The benefit, to
the extent there is some there, is that those were almost entirely reserved and that was a big portion of the
release as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, one last cleanup question. So, you had already thought that NII would be 20% higher next year, and
then you sold $7 billion of the securities at near highs. So, I assume, you got a nice yield pick-up, so – better lucky
than smarter, maybe it was – maybe you had some great timing there, but – so, why wouldn't that 20% number,
so the increase in the NII in 2025 versus 2024 go higher because of that fortuitous investing of those securities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I'll take lucky or good either. But just to remind you, Mike, the 20% that we shared contemplated the
repositioning. So, what we're talking about is marginal improvement on the reinvestment. We're really happy with
where we did it, and we took advantage of that pick-up in rates. But that's relative to maybe it's a handful of basis
points better, not – that 20% wasn't – had already contemplated the repositioning of that portfolio. So, again, I
think on the...

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
It still in fact contemplates...

Clark H. I. Khayat A

added on top of the 20%.

Good morning and sorry about the technical problems earlier. I just have a couple...

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Not a problem. Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. A couple real quick questions. On the capital markets revenue side, I know you flagged some very
solid pipelines and building pipelines there, and your expectation to hit the high end of the $600 million to $650
million guide. Chris, I know when you've had this type of confidence in the past, you actually called out the
likelihood of a record year the following year as well. I believe you did that last year. Can you maybe provide your
thoughts on 2025 here, just given the progression you're seeing, maybe how we see that playing out in terms of
your capital markets revs as you look at heading into 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Fair question. So, clearly, sort of embedded in our guidance for 2024, if you kind of do the math is another
step-up in the fourth quarter, maybe $180 million or so, if you kind of just back into it. I feel good about the
trajectory. I think, if we continue to have this kind of an environment where rates are stabilizing and people are
able to transact, I'm optimistic about 2025. We'll give more guidance on that, John, when we gather after the end
of the year, but I think you should assume that a lot of these pipelines have pretty long tails. And so, we should go
into 2025 with a fair amount of momentum.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That's helpful. Thanks, Chris. And just two more quick ones. On the loan growth front, I believe, you mentioned
relative stability as you look into 2025, given the trends you're seeing, given consumer likely declining, but
commercial increases. Are you able to give us a better idea of the pace of growth that you think is reasonable and
what type of growth, more specifically on the commercial side, do you think that can help offset consumer
pressure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, we'll provide a little bit more color there, but just maybe broadly think about consumer loans coming down $2
billion to $3 billion in a year just by natural kind of maturity and paydown. Now, that could change based on rate
levels and mortgage markets, but that's kind of a decent rule of thumb there. As it relates to where we would see

some pick-up in commercial, I'll make a couple comments and then Chris can add on to it. But in places where we
have demonstrated strength, and I think mostly like affordable and renewables, which are – tend to be project
transactions, they tend to be construction in nature. So, they build through time, and then we perm them out in
some form.
Those, I think, are places where we're starting – where we've seen affordable, we've been pretty consistent, but
we're seeing pick-up there, I think the opportunity to build that over time, and those loans do take time to
materialize just because they are large projects. They do build from a draw standpoint before they're ready to be
fully drawn and sold. So, those are two places where I just continue to feel confident about our abilities and the
market, but there's some broader based opportunities, I think, as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. The only thing I'd add Clark is, as I mentioned earlier, I think the transactions business will generate loans,
because that's picking up, sort of a wild card that all of us are watching is what's going to happen with our existing
client base in terms of really investing in CapEx and what's going to happen with utilization, and I think that's just
a watch point for all of us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks, Chris. I do have one last one. Sorry about that. On the loan loss reserve, you did on a loans to –
on a reserve ratio basis, you did bleed the reserve modestly this quarter. Can you perhaps provide us a little bit of
thoughts around the potential for incremental releases here as you see credit playing out, given the economic
outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Look, we – so, we view – you're right, 3 basis points I think down on the ACL, so pretty stable. We built it up quite
significantly over the last several quarters. I think, if you did a loan kind of portfolio by portfolio mix, it might dictate
that we'd be – we could even be lower. But right now, we're still looking at – we're being cautious around
migration and where some of the late-cycle pieces of this are taking us. I think, if rates continue to come down,
and as Chris noted, the environment remains constructive, that may give us some opportunity. But right now, we
feel like stability is probably the right place.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I mean, John, there's really three things that drive these. One is your view of the macro and you obviously have a
perspective on that. The next is sort of idiosyncratic, and obviously, if we were aware of idiosyncratic things, we
would be – as we aggressively took on the three loans that we talked about today, we'd be moving on those. And
the third element is the size of the book. So, those are kind of the three elements. And so, if you think about each
of those three, obviously, it begs the question of where should the reserve be and we'll continue to evaluate it.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted to follow up on John's questions on the loans just for the fourth quarter. You didn't change the full year
guidance for the average, which would imply that there's going to be some decent growth in the fourth quarter.
And I was just wondering if you could talk about maybe just what you're expecting for fourth quarter loan trends.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I mean, we took the ending point down a bit. I think that will take us to the overall kind of lower end of
the average guide. Look, I think we're expecting some stability on the loan side at this point, not a huge amount of
growth, I'd say, some modest growth. But whether or not we get that, I don't think really impacts our view on NII in
the quarter. We'd obviously like to start seeing some loan growth. So, at this point, I'd say, it's more stabilizing
than it is really picking up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then, Chris, if I could just ask one big picture question. Obviously, you're getting the second tranche of
the investment from Scotia. The focus would be the securities restructuring along with organic growth. But just
with now that you've built up your capital levels, just can I ask how you think about bank M&A going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, the premise of your question is right. So, think about us raising $2.8 billion and we basically in the
aggregate spend $1.4 billion on the restructuring, then we have an additional $1.5 billion, and on a pro forma
basis, I think you'll see our CET1 at say 12% and you'll see our marked CET1 at say 10%. So, clearly, we'll have
dry powder that we'll be able to – if there's dislocation in the market, we'll be able to take advantage of that. We'll
probably run with a little higher capital just in the near-term until there's finalization in the Basel III endgame, the
liquidity rules, the long-term debt. But I do believe, Peter, that there will be consolidation in our industry. There
certainly hasn't been for all the reasons that you are well aware of. I think, last year, there were three significant
deals completed. My experience with consolidation is, when it happens, it happens kind of in waves, and clearly,
with this additional capital, I think, we'd be well positioned if and when that were to happen. It's not something
we're focused on now, however.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the follow-up. Clark, if possible, wanted to just revisit the expense outlook,
particularly in the fourth quarter. It seems to be generating a lot of traffic this morning. I know you said higher
stock price will impact incentive comp, then I think you said some kind of proactive investments as well. But at a
point I think I might have heard Foundation contribution as well. Are you able to sort of parse if we're going to see
maybe $100 million of total expense lift in the fourth quarter, how much of that is ongoing stuff versus what people
might sort of pull out as transitory? And then, also appreciate that you suggested already not to annualize that,
but just hoping for a little more deep dive in there, if possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. It's a good question. I think the annual – the main point which you picked up on, which was don't annualize
that number. I think the fair point is some our business is variable in nature based on performance. So, hard to
quantify that, but frankly, if we have the revenues that dictate we should be paying compensation on that, we
would take those like any day of the week. So, I think you have to think about some of that expense growth in the
context of the revenue that's driving it.
As Chris said, we're potentially leaning into some unique opportunities in the quarter. Those are going to be, by
their nature, not necessarily recurring. And I don't have a specific number for you, but clearly, it's not appropriate
to take the full amount of that, and I think we just – we got to fine tune a little bit of how much expense rolls into
the run rate quarter, and a lot of that's going to be based on how much revenue we think it's supporting. So, we
just need to do a little bit more work to give you a clean look, but I do think the – again, the appropriate guide at
this point would be mid-single-digits for next year, and we owe you, as I said, more detail when we come back at
the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay. Perfect. Thank you, again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back to Chris Gorman for
any closing comments.
