Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was an incredible year in
many respects, with the Fed's aggressive moves to subdue inflation, a West Coast bank failures, a surprisingly
resilient economy, and several significant proposals from bank regulators. It was important in navigating this
dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense, while continuing to play disciplined offense and
take advantage of opportunities in the market.
Defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management, and I feel really good about how we ended the year.
Our capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals, with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, CET1 adjusted
for AOCI of roughly 9%, and a tangible common equity ratio of 6.7%. Our liquidity position is at an all-time best
with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, pro forma Category I LCR of 117%, and a 156% liquidity coverage of our
uninsured deposits.
Our ACL ratio is at 159%, compared to 130% pro forma day-one CECL, and General Office reserves are at
10.2%. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships,
which deliver stronger relative returns. We are using a Non-Core Strategy to run off loans and free capital for
better opportunities.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
On offense, we have several important initiatives we are driving, such as the Private Bank buildout, the New York
City Metro Initiative, our focus on serving Private Capital and growing our payments business. These are all
tracking well. In particular, we are pleased to see the Private Bank team reached $1.2 billion in deposits soon
after our launch in late October. Our finances over the course of the year came under some pressure, primarily
given higher funding costs. Nonetheless, we delivered a 13.5% underlying ROTCE for the full year, with a 95%
return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see smaller sequential declines in NII than in the prior quarter as the Fed last
hiked in July and the pressure on funding costs has lessened. We saw a modest bounce back in fees, but are
very encouraged by the tone of the markets in 2024 to date. Hopefully, we start to see our big capital markets
pipelines begin to deliver.
We took some meaningful cost actions in Q4 to set the stage for a very modest expense growth in 2024. We only
had the Private Bank for two quarters. So if you normalize for that, we're actually reducing the legacy expense
base by 1.4%. I should reinforce, though, that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives.
Credit outlook continues to track expectations. CRE General Office is being carefully managed. Losses are being
absorbed in net charge-offs. It's relatively predictable, with few surprises so far. Away from that, credit quality is
strong. In Q4, we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio, which is a promising sign. On the capital
front, we did not buy in any stock in Q4 given the charges related to the FDIC special surcharge, as well as
associated with our cost initiatives. We expect to be back in the market in Q1 and for that to continue through
2024.
Turning to our outlook, we expect NII to continue with modest declines through midyear and then start to tick up.
The exciting news on NIM/NII is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and Non-Core run-off over 2025 to
2027, which will power higher EPS and returns. We are poised for strong fee growth led by capital markets. Net
charge-offs will rise modestly, but we are likely to see ACL releases over the course of the year.
Our key priorities for 2024 will be to continue to operate with a strong defense/prudent offense mindset. We have
many exciting things on our technology, our digital, data analytics and AI road map that we need to deliver on. It's
an exciting time for Citizens. We feel we are well positioned for medium-term outperformance.
I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering great effort in 2023.
We know we can count on you, again, in the New Year.
With that, let me turn it over to John.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with some commentary on 2023. We demonstrated
excellent balance sheet strength, while delivering solid financial performance. We were resilient through a
turbulent environment, benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels and strong liquidity based on stable
consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources. This strength allowed us to execute well
against our multi-year strategic initiatives, while opportunistically building out the Private Bank.
On slide 6, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS of $3.88, which included a $0.51 drag from Non-Core
and an $0.11 investment in the Private Bank. Full year ROTCE was 13.5% after incorporating these items.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Before I discuss the details of the fourth quarter results, here are some highlights referencing slides 4, 5 and 7.
On the slides, you can see we generated underlying net income of $426 million for the fourth quarter and EPS of
$0.85. This includes $0.06 for our continued investment in the start-up of the Private Bank and a $0.15 negative
impact from the Non-Core portfolio.
We had a significant increase from the impacts from notable items this quarter included on slide 4. The largest
driver was the FDIC special assessment, followed by elevated TOP and severance related expenses, attributable
to meaningful head count reduction. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 11.8%.
Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTCE of 14.8%. Currently, the Private Bank start-up
investment is dilutive to results, but relatively quickly, this will become increasingly accretive. The Private Bank is
off to a very good start, raising about $1.2 billion of deposits through the end of the year, of which more than 30%
are non-interest-bearing. While our Non-Core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it continues to run off,
further bolstering our overall performance going forward.
We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position, with CET1 at 10.6%, or 9% adjusted for the AOCI
opt-out removal and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.59%, up from 1.55% in third quarter. This includes a robust
10.2% coverage for General Office, up from 9.5% in the prior quarter.
We continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter, achieving our planned liquidity profile. Our pro forma
Category I Bank LCR rose to 117% from 109% in the prior quarter. We also reduced our period-end FHLB
borrowings by $3.3 billion quarter-over-quarter to $3.8 billion, and our period-end LDR-improved linked quarter to
82% from 84%.
Regarding strategic initiatives, as previously mentioned, the Private Bank is off to a great start and TOP continues
to contribute. In addition, New York Metro is tracking well, and we are poised to capitalize on the growing Private
Capital opportunity.
Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail. Turning to slide 8, starting with net interest income.
As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, partially offset by a
2% increase in average interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, the
combined benefit of higher asset yields and Non-Core run-off were more than offset by higher funding costs and
swaps, the net impact of which reduced NIM by 3 basis points to the 3% level. The additional 9 basis point decline
to 2.91% was due to the impact of our liquidity build, which was neutral to NII.
Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased a modest 3 basis points to 51%, as the Fed has paused
and we see continued but slowing deposit migration. We expect this moderating trend to continue until the Fed
eventually cuts rates. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well, with our beta generally in the pack with
peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end
of peers.
Moving to slide 9, fees were up 2% linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record
performance from wealth. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. The improvement in
capital markets reflects increased activity, with the decline in long rates in November, driving a nice pickup in
bond underwriting. Equities improved with the strength in the back half of the quarter, as the environment became
more favorable. M&A advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the
better macro and rates outlook, although several transactions pushed to Q1.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
We see capital markets momentum picking up in Q1 as markets are positive and our deal pipelines are strong.
The wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in AUM growth.
The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees, as high mortgage rates continue to
weigh on lock volumes. The servicing operating P&L improved modestly, while the MSR valuation, net of hedging,
was lower.
On slide 10, we did well on expenses, which were down slightly linked quarter, even while including the impact of
the continued Private Bank start-up investment. Our reported expense of $1.61 billion, increased $319 million,
including notable items totaling $323 million, namely the industry-wide FDIC special assessment of $225 million,
and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into 2024. I'll discuss that in
more detail in a few minutes.
On slide 11, average loans are down 2% and period-end loans are down 3% linked quarter. This was driven by
Non-Core portfolio run-off and a decline in commercial loans, which were partly offset by some modest core
growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan
demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new
lending in this environment. Average commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter, as clients
remained cautious and M&A activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment.
Next, on slides 12 and 13, we continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were broadly stable linked
quarter, with an increase in consumer driven by the Private Bank, offset by lower commercial. The decline in
commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits running off
approximately $3.5 billion of higher cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter.
Absent this BSO effect, deposits would have been up by about 1.5% this quarter.
Our interest-bearing deposit costs are up 19 basis points, which translates to 51% cumulative beta. Our deposit
franchise is highly diversified across product, product mix and channels, with 67% of our deposits in consumer
and about 71% insured or secure. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in
the higher rate environment.
With the Fed holding steady, we saw a continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories, with non-
interest-bearing now representing about 21% of total deposits. This is slightly below pre-pandemic levels, and we
expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here, although this will be dependent on the path of
rates and customer behavior.
Moving on to credit, on slide 14. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter. We were
pleased to see that commercial charge-offs were stable linked quarter, and we also saw a modest decline in
criticized loans as we continue to work through the General Office portfolio. We saw continued normalization in
charge-offs in the retail portfolio along with seasonal impacts.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 15. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.59%, which is a 4
basis point increase from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the denominator effect of lower portfolio balances.
We increased the reserve for the $3.6 billion General Office portfolio to $370 million, which represents a coverage
of 10.2%, up from 9.5% in the third quarter, as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers. We have
already taken $148 million in charge-offs in this portfolio, which is about 4% of loans.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve
coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in
historical downturns. So we feel the current coverage is very strong.
Moving to slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%.
And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio
would be about 9%. Also, our tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.7% at the end of the year. Both our
CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers and you can see on slide 36 in the
Appendix, where we stand currently relative to peers in the third quarter.
We returned a total of $198 million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter. We paused our share
repurchases in the fourth quarter in light of the FDIC special assessment. Having exceeded our target capital
level for year-end, we expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Nevertheless, we plan to maintain strong
capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly
transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size.
On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including
our Private Bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program. First, on slide 17, the buildout of the
Private Bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum. Following our formal launch in the fourth
quarter, our bankers have raised more than $1.2 billion of attractive deposits, with roughly 75% of that from
commercial clients. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York,
Boston, and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California.
We have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies, and we are opportunistically adding
talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Clarfeld wealth management business as the
centerpiece of that effort.
Moving to slide 18, you are all well aware of our efforts in New York Metro. That's going really well and we are
hitting our targets there. And on the commercial side, as I mentioned before, we are starting to see momentum
building in capital markets. This should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital-
backing private equity gets put to work.
Next on slide 19, we continue to be disciplined on expenses. It's important to remember that a key to Citizens'
success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits
back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 8 program,
achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of about $115 million at the end of 2023. And we've launched TOP 9, with a
goal of an exit run rate of about $135 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2024.
The new TOP program is focused on efficiency opportunities and further automation and the use of AI to better
serve our customers. We are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization and save more on third-party
spend as well. Last year, we exited the Auto business, and we also exited the Wholesale Mortgage business in
the fourth quarter.
We are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions. In the fourth quarter, we've reduced
our head count by about 650, or approximately 3.5%. And we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and
are rationalizing some of our corporate and back office facilities. Given all this work, we are targeting to limit our
underlying expense growth in 2024 to roughly 1% to 1.5%, with a net decrease in legacy Citizens' expenses of
1.3% to 1.5%, being offset by investments in the Private Bank.

Playing prudent defense is at the top of our priority list, given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that
began back in March and the uncertain macro outlook. So, we are reworking both sides of the balance sheet
through our balance sheet optimization efforts. Slide 20 provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan
portfolio through our Non-Core strategy and optimization on the commercial side, with a focus on relationship-
based lending and attractive risk-adjusted returns.
On the left side of the page, you'll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining $11 billion Non-Core portfolio,
which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is
expected to decline by about $6.4 billion from where we were at the end of the year to about $4.7 billion at the
end of 2025. And as this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction
in wholesale funding, with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core
portfolio. The capital recaptured through reduction in Non-Core RWA will be primarily reallocated to support
attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the Private Bank. In the broader consumer portfolio, we
are targeting growth in the home equity, card and mortgage, which offer the greatest relationship potential.
Moving to the right side of the page, we are also working on the commercial portfolio, exiting lower return credit-
only relationships and focusing on selective C&I lending with multi-product relationship opportunities. We are
leading more deals in our front-book, improving spreads, while also improving the overall return profile of the
book.
In the Appendix, we have included more information covering the broad contours of our BSO program, including
how we are managing our high quality deposit book, remixing our wholesale funding, managing our securities
portfolio, and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment.
Moving to slide 21, I will take you through our full year 2024 outlook, which contemplates the early January
forward curve and a Fed funds rate of 4.25% by the end of the year. We expect NII to be down 6% to 9%, with
changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline, and average loans down roughly 2% to 3%.
However, we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 5%, with Private Bank growing over the course of the year and
commercial activity picking up in the second half.
On the deposit side, we expect spot growth of 1.2% – I'm sorry, 1% to 2% and well-controlled deposit costs, with
a terminal beta in the low-50s before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in May. We expect our net interest margin
to trough around the middle of the year and average in the 2.8% to 2.85% range for the full year, and we expect
to exit the year around 2.85%.
We've included slide 23, which shows the expected swaps and Non-Core impact through 2027. In 2024, we
expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the Non-Core rundown.
You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the Appendix on slide 38, which demonstrates how the 2024
headwind, which is incorporated in our 2024 NII guide, reverses to a substantial NII tailwind in 2025 and beyond,
as the current forward curve is realized. For example, there is an expected improvement in NII contribution from
swaps in 2025 year-over-year of approximately $371 million, with continued meaningful benefits in 2026 and
2027.
Non-interest income is expected to be up in the 6% to 9% range, depending upon the market environment, led by
a nice rebound in capital markets. We expect expenses to be up about 1% to 1.5%. Excluding the Private Bank,

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
this would be about – this would be down 1.3% to 1.5%. We have provided a walk showing the components of our
2024 expense outlook on slide 22 to provide more context.
NCOs are expected to average about 50 basis points for the year, as we continue to work through the General
Office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail. Given macro trends, our remixing of the balance sheet
through commercial BSO and the Non-Core strategy and expectations for modest portfolio growth, we will see –
we will likely see ACL releases over the course of the year. We plan to resume share repurchases in the first
quarter in the $300 million range with more over the course of the year, depending upon market conditions and
loan growth. Taking that into account, we still expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio of about 10.5%,
which is at the upper end of our target range. Putting it all together, we expect to return to sequential positive
operating leverage in the second half of the year with PPNR troughing in the second quarter 2024.
Moving to slides 24 and 25. As Bruce mentioned, we are well-positioned to deliver attractive returns. As we look
out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieve a 16% to 18% ROTCE. We expect to generate solid
returns from our legacy core business, with a substantial NII tailwind given swap portfolio run-off. We expect to
deliver positive operating leverage with strong expense discipline, and we are well-positioned to grow fees
meaningfully given the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past few years.
We also expect a meaningful contribution from the Private Bank as it matures and a tailwind from the run-off of
the Non-Core portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity. We will continue to operate with a prudent risk
appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program
and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over the medium term, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain within
our target range of 10% to 10.5%, about 50 basis points higher than our prior target range, given continued
uncertainty in the macro environment.
On slide 26, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to
lower day count impact on revenue, as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses.
To wrap up, we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in 2023, as we work
to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term. We delivered
solid results this quarter and we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and funding position that puts us in an
excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise.
We are continuing to optimize the balance sheet and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive
deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Can you guys provide some color on the drivers to that spot loan growth, including some details about the
contribution from the Private Bank and what you're thinking in terms of commercial line utilization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just start off and others can add. But I mean, I think those are the two drivers. As you mentioned, when
we look out into primarily the second half of 2024, we are seeing an expectation that commercial activity will pick
up. Loan utilization is flattening out here, we expect, early in the year and then so that will be part of the driver.
We also have had some BSO activity in late 2023 and early 2024 that we expect to moderate in the second half of
the year as well. So you're going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side.
And then on the consumer side of things, we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the
mortgage space and with HELOC, which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us. But those are the
main drivers. Then, of course, broadly, the Private bank, which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side
of things in late 2023, we're going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in 2024. So those are the big, I
would say, components of seeing that [ph] spot loan growth (00:29:34).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe Brendan, you could talk a little bit about what you expect for Private Bank lending in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. Well, I would start by just a quick comment on Q4 for the Private Bank, obviously, strong deposit
print, and I think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified and led by wealth and
deposits and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationships. So we're really excited
about the print and the start by the team.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Having said that, we do expect lending to pick up steam in 2024. Given the interest rate environment, mortgages
are, obviously, challenged on the retail side. So the lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending,
which has skewed in the private equity and venture space, which will be appetite in the profile of that business.
And it's been critical to start to dislodge personal/private banking relationships from the ecosystem of private
equity and venture. So we're off to a really good start. I suspect, given the forward curves, that the first half of the
year will continue to be led by commercial, principally in private equity and venture lending.
Over time, we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending, home equity
lending, mortgage lending coming in at scale, as the rate environment dictates opportunities there. We also
expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity and venture with
private banking and personal banking. So you'll start to see an asset diversification over time. But the first half of
the year, we would expect that to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Great. Don, anything to add on the commercial side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think if you look back in the fourth quarter, the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were about
50% utilization, 50% BSO, with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there. So people that were carrying
slightly higher balances on the commercial side, a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed
off in the last six weeks of the year, and that's continued into this year.
So, I think the particular area that we're excited about as we get into the back end of 2024 is the private equity
space. I mean, that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years. There's a lots of
conversations going on. We're hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active and
that will drive utilization on our capital call lines, which is at an all-time low right now. So I think that's what the real
driver is.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Just a quick follow-up. Don, it's helpful. But on just the fee income, you talked about up 6% to 9%. You did
mention the pipeline is strong for the capital markets. But just if you could give some color on the puts and takes
on the fee income side?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Yeah. Just kind of the main drivers of that, it's basically a continuation of some of the trends we're seeing in the
fourth quarter of 2023, where capital markets is starting to pick up again. Pipelines are incredibly strong. And I
think the lead driver seems to be M&A advisory. That's picked up in 4Q, not only due to seasonal factors, but just
in terms of a more constructive backdrop. We're also seeing, as you get in out into 2024, pickup in underwriting,
both on the bond side and on the equity side and so – and solid contributions from Global Markets as well, but –
so those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in Q4, continuing in Q1, with excellent pipelines and
playing out over the rest of 2024.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. You might add something on wealth, Brendan, I don't know if you want to – but we expect continued really
strong growth on wealth fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We do. And, yeah, it's been a year of slow and steady progression, continuing to get all-time highs in the wealth
management business. But given the Private Bank investment, 2024 is going to be really important year. We're
out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent. We've made a number of key hires in Q4, both on the leadership
side as well as at the advisor side. And so given the ecosystem of the bankers that we've we hired in the summer,
connected with top-end market wealth managers is critical for us. We're rebranding the platform to Citizens
Private Wealth Management to connect the private banking and wealth side together hand in glove. And so we do
expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time, really connected into the private banking ecosystem.
So we're pleased with the momentum, but there's a lot more to come, and we hope, if we execute well on the
private banking initiative.

And just on mortgage banking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So John hit some highlights on Q4 for mortgage. Yeah. Production was down a bit. Our underlying
servicing business was up modestly. And then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in Q3 and
Q4. I think as we look the outlook going forward, we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage
business. If you rewind the clock back to prior to the Franklin American acquisition, we were under-scale in
mortgage and really, we're trying to diversify the business. We've done that really successfully. In hindsight, it was
an incredibly well-timed acquisition and we performed exceptionally well through the COVID years.
And as we exit that period of time and look forward, our MSR concentration versus peers is really strong. It's a
little bit on the high side. We looked at our business model and said wholesale mortgage, we're one of the only
[ph] lot (00:35:07) lenders in there. The margins were really challenged. And the outlook for rates don't
necessarily suggest a boomlet of refi activity in the medium term. And so wholesale mortgage, being a non-

relationship business, we decided that it was time to move on. And we're committed to correspond and we're
really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending.
So – but despite rates coming down, we do expect the mortgage market to be, call it, a $2 trillion originations
platform in 2024, which is about a normalized mortgage market. So we should see some modest uptick in
originations. And with rates coming back down, the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure.
So I think we feel like we're in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance where we're at Q4 within a range
of normal volatility. And we're going to make sure that we're executing on driving up returns higher and making
sure we're allocating balance sheet to deep relationship-based customers, whether it's in the Private Bank or in
the core retail business, to continue to offer that product to our very best customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, wrapping all that up, in 2024, we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins. So that's another
tailwind as we get into the – into next year in terms of the production business.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you guys elaborate a bit on the expense cuts that you did this quarter in terms of where
they're coming from? And obviously, you're leaning in on the Private Bank but kind of ex that, how do you make
sure you're not cutting too much given these initiatives and the ones that you've had in prior years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start off here. But I think we have been very, very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all
the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies. There's always the playbook where if you kind of
eliminate your bottom X percent of performers and redistribute some of the work that you can kind of run a little
leaner. And so we've gone through that exercise to make sure that we won't be caught short in any areas.
We carved out important areas like risk and audit and some of the control areas. So they were spared kind of
from taking reductions. And then we also carved out the areas that are important [ph] to (00:37:43) investment
activities. And so, the roll-up of all that, Matt, comes to a relatively modest number, 3.5% of total staff count. But I
think we're kind of lean and mean and in good fighting shape as we enter into 2024.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, the deposit growth that you've had from the Private Bank, have you
disclosed what that rate is? I think a third of them are non-interest-bearing. But what's the blended rate? And I
guess, are you using promotions, whether it's rate or other stuff to help grow those? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We never really talked about that. But I mean, I think we should look at is that the – this is accretive to the
low cost profile top of the house. When you look at DDA and operating accounts, it's extremely attractive mix that
we've seen come in early days. So we're extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a very sort
of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side – on the other side of the
balance sheet. So, yeah, I would say the mix is quite good and overall cost, very attractive and accretive to top of
house.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There's a slide 11, Matt, that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits. But DDA and then
checking with interest, which are very low cost, roughly 40%, very little term, and most of that in kind of liquid
savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what we're offering to the core
franchise.

Just a couple of questions on the credit front. Charge-offs came in at around 46 basis points in the fourth quarter.
You expect an average of about 50 basis points overall in 2024. Can you maybe talk to us about where you
expect losses to peak and to hit that 50 bps for the full year? And what gives you confidence that they can remain
there? And then, similarly, on the reserve front, I know you added to reserves in the fourth quarter, but you
implied you could see releases in 2024. What do you need to see to drive the releases? Thanks.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So I'll start, and John can then give some more color. So I think the kind of push that we've seen higher
over the course of 2023, that could continue a little bit higher into 2024. So going from 46 basis points, say, to 50
basis points is kind of twofold for the most part. One is the CRE General Office is – we're watching the maturity
wall [ph] on (00:40:52) top of all these credits very carefully and we're working them out.
And as I said in my opening remarks, a lot of this is fairly predictable. So kind of we can look ahead six months,
nine months. We can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take
charge-offs. And so I think we have good visibility into that. It's a long process on the CRE General Office. I think
we'll have this with us all through 2024 and likely into 2025 as well. But again, the important thing is, I think, we're
well reserved for it and it's baked into that charge-off run rate.
The second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side, which has been extremely slow and
gradual, but they're still slightly better than where we were pre-COVID. And so, that will just gently push up as we
go forward. And so that would be the other driver. I'd say the good news is that, in C&I, we're not really seeing
any kind of hotspots, and so we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad C&I through 2024.
On the question of the ACL is, this year, we've been consistently building each quarter. And if you get to the
scenario where there's likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession, we've put away enough reserves that I
think we will be able to start to draw that down. And so time will tell on that. But you can already see that we've
been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve build from absolute provision over charge-offs. In
this quarter, it was flat. It was $171 million over $171 million. And so even if charge-offs can tick up a little bit, I
think it's likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed charge-offs
reduce as we go through the year.
I don't know, John, if you want to add any color to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Just a little bit. I think that all makes sense. And I'd say that the drivers of where you want to be with your
reserve is, we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon, which is a mild-to-
moderate adverse outcome. So that's built in. We think that we're seeing stabilization in terms of the performance
of the back-book in our loan book. So we see visibility into the charge-off outlook.
And then the build, which is the other – could be the other driver of ACL when you're building loans that what
we're rotating away from and building into, there's actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high
quality origination front-book in the Private Bank and commercial that we're putting on portfolio in 2024, while
other stuff that may be a higher ACL load is running off in the back-book. So those are the things I would just add
to what Bruce said.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Great. All right. Thank you for that. And then, separately, on the capital front, you indicated that you expect to
resume buybacks in the first quarter of 2024. Maybe if you can help us possibly quantify the pace of buybacks,
that's fair to assume. Could you be back at that $200 million quarterly rate, or how should we think about that?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, at this point, we've given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about $300 million. So we probably,
with benefit of 2020 hindsight, could have bought some in the fourth quarter, but water under the bridge, [ph]
we're 10.6% (00:44:51). So we have a little above target capital to kind of play with, if you will, in the first quarter.
And then in the first half of the year, we're not going to have much net loan growth. Non-Core is going to be
running down, and we don't really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the Private Bank and
commercial, as John indicated.
So, I think the buybacks would tend to be more first half-oriented. But a lot can happen over the course of the
year. And so, I'd kind of defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate just to say we'll have a solid print in the first
quarter and likely more in the second quarter and then we'll see how the year plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

John Pancari Q

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...our strong dividend and if we have opportunities to put capital to work, serving clients and driving great – really
strong risk-adjusted returns, that's our preference. And when that moderates a bit, that's when you see us give it
back in the form of buybacks. And so we're in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity
[indiscernible] (00:45:59)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And one last add-on point to your add-on point is, I would say, I'm really happy to be buying my stock at these
levels, because we think it's great value, yeah.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, maybe one question for you, Bruce. As you think about capital deployment, you've been pretty busy last
year in terms the strategic actions. Just wondering where do you see, like as you look at investment opportunities
for the franchise, are you done for now in terms of putting the big pieces in place or how are you thinking about
new things and new investments that we could see either on an organic basis, team lift-outs or just outright M&A?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Good question. I would say, the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives. So we've
mentioned the Private Bank and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big
success. And we've been investing in the New York marketplace. And certainly, to get your brand awareness up
is expensive proposition, but we're doing that, and that is showing very good results. There are certain businesses
like payments that are, I think, going through a lot of change, and that change always presents opportunities. And
so making sure that we're investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain share and grow
that business, those are the things that kind of come top of mind that we're very focused on.
I think, in terms of acquisitions in our fee-based capabilities, we've made significant investments over time in
commercial. And so, our M&A size and scale is at quite a good level. So we could be selective there. Don't see
anything imminent, but there's possibilities that if there's an industry vertical that makes sense, maybe we could
do something there. And then, wealth, we've been looking at trying to buy some things. We bought Clarfeld, which
turned out to be a fantastic acquisition. But I think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the lift-out
route and to bring teams on to the platform. And so we're hard at work on that to try to scale up Citizens Private
Wealth.
So, I would say, the franchise is in good shape. There's a lot of initiatives in place that will kind of, I think, have us
outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers. So, I think we can sit back and be selective in terms of
deploying capital inorganically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That is helpful. And I guess just one follow-up in terms of, for whatever reason, when you look at your NII and see
revenue guide, in particular, just maybe talk to us around expense flex. If some of these things don't play out as
expected, should we anticipate some level of like expense offset, or are you kind of pretty tight given just
everything you've done on the cost side?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, there's always opportunities to look – to flex your expense base down. I think we've been pretty
hard at it here to get to this level. And I'd say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility. But again, if you're
looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with $0.03 to $0.05 or something of
that magnitude, if that puts at jeopardy your kind of trajectory on things like Private Bank, it wouldn't appear to be
a really advisable decision to take. So we will always look at that. You know, you can trust us to do that. But at
this point, we're trying to manage for both near-term delivery, but also with an eye towards the medium term and
really getting that ROTCE back into the kind of targeted range.

Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I think, John, I think you've got five rate cuts built into the guidance. Just maybe a broad thought on sort of where
the balance sheet is geared now. In other words, I guess, more specifically, how would more or fewer cuts impact
the NII outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I would say that we're very close to neutral, one way or the other, really up or down. And – but I'd
say that, I think what's important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter
and it continued this quarter. We expect to continue next quarter. But as our outlook is [ph] until you (00:51:09)
get that first cut, it still doesn't completely go away. So we have an expectation the first cut comes in the second
quarter, and we get down to around 4.25%. I think that's still holding around where – looking out the window today
in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate.
I would say that if there's a slight bias, if the cuts came in a little fewer this year, that would – it would probably –
it'd be okay. But nevertheless, that first cut is key. And a general normalization and an orderly fashion over time is
what we think is very good for our balance sheet. Again, staying around neutral, but maybe a slight benefit if rates
come in a tiny bit higher in 2024.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The other aspect to that, too, is just we've had an inverted curve for a long time. So when you think about the
medium term, presumably, we get back to a point where there is a normal yield curve, which also benefits NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you. And then, also John, for you. So, the liquidity building efforts have introduced some noise into
the margin rate, even if they've been NII neutral. I guess, just looking at the guidance, presumably that's going to
be less of a factor going forward. But just maybe a thought on sort of where we are in that journey?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say, we're basically – we've achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity build, just the headline
there and [ph] as, I think we believe (00:52:39) a very strong kind of position being around 117% of the
requirements for Category I banks, I think that matches our objectives. And therefore, going forward, you will not
see liquidity being a headwind to net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year. It affected us in Q3. It affected
us in Q4. If you actually look at, I think, one of the dialogues on these calls way back, are we going to exit the year
close to 3% underlying? Well, we actually did do that. The underlying performance on our NIM was quite good. It
only dropped 3 basis points, which is showing up well relative to everybody's [ph] opinion (00:53:31) so far.
But that liquidity build, which is neutral to NII, took us down another 9 basis points. So we end up exiting closer to
2.90% than to the 3%. But that liquidity build is kind of done. And so we can just focus on not having that exercise
in that from the conversation and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I mean, I think the – that is the driver, basically, that we are looking at NII being cut. That's 75% of our
revenues. So yeah, the NII is going to bottom in that quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A

Loan growth. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...loan growth starting to kick in. And so even though the swap is incremental, forward starting swaps, then I think
you'd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would
allow us to absorb that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just looking out at the longer-term guidance you gave, just talking about the 3.25%, 3.40%
medium-term NIM range. It seems like that most of that can be gotten from the three buckets that you show just
getting curing from the fourth quarter level. And I see that you put in a 3.25% end of 2025 Fed funds rate. So I'm
just wondering how you expect deposit costs and just beta to traject, and I know there's a lot of moving parts in
there, too, because of the growth that you're expecting as well and mix changes. But just can you – maybe just
start by just talking about, if you're getting to the low-50s on the way up, just how that expects to act and
influences that medium-term NIM range? Thanks.

John F. Woods A

Yeah. It's a big driver. I mean, I think the big puts and takes there, I mean, you've got the swap portfolio, which is
a big tailwind as we've talked about. But if you go over to the deposit side of things, we are looking at deposit

migration stabilizing around mid-2024. After that first cut in May, you see deposit migration stabilizing. And then
as cuts continue, we start flipping to down-beta type of expectation versus the up-beta. And we look at the early-
2000s as being instructive for a lot of this, where that tightening, that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would
imply a 35% to 40% down-beta for the first, call it, 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And so that's a good, I
think, yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle, our down-beta will be less than
the full up-beta. So, our full up-beta is low-50s. But nevertheless, we're going to get big contributions from down-
beta, and that will grow over time getting close to where the up-beta ended up.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Putting all your answers together, John and Bruce, about the
outlook for 2024 and the underlying dynamics of net interest income, it seems to me that if we put together what
you just said to Ken about deposit betas in slide 23, that despite the exit rate of your net interest margin
forecasted to be 2.85% in the fourth quarter, based on everything that you've told us, it seems like you'll see a
three handle in terms of that underlying NIM that Bruce discussed in 2025. Is that a good bridge to thinking about
where you're exiting in 2024 and then that medium-term range that you gave us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, I would say, while we're exiting 2024 at 2.85%, we've indicated that's where the fourth quarter of 2023 is
going to – first quarter of 2024 will be. And so that's headed to the 3.25% to 3.40% range. And so you would see
us crossing that 3% level in 2025 sometime, on the way to 3.25%.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Bruce, you guys have done a great job from when you went public to where you are today in transforming this
company. So I'm curious on your medium-term outlook for ROTCE. On the improvement, you highlight that the
Private Bank, you're targeting at 20% to 24% ROTCE. Can you share with us the mix of how you get there?
Meaning, what percentage of revenue do you think you need to reach from fees versus net interest income? And
then also, what kind of pre-tax margin do you think you'll need to get to get to that 20% to 24% target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe I'll just start off with that, Gerard. It's John. I mean, I think, our fees to total revenues are in the
neighborhood of 25%. I'd say, over the medium term, you're going to see that migrate closer to 30%, and that
would be consistent with a – of the balance sheet optimization efforts, where all of the capital we're putting to work
on the front-book would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and fee-based opportunities
associated with it at a much greater rate than what we're seeing running off in the back-book. And so that's going
to drive that fee percentage up closer to 30%.
And when I think that the returns that we expect from a, call it, the ROTCE, the ROTCE return that you're seeing
in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets that's north of 1%. So you see that getting closer
to 125 basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
John, you're answering at the comprehensive company on that MTO page. I think Gerard is focused more
specifically on the Private Bank mix. But there, I would say, it will build over time, the fee percentage as we kind of
get the wealth cross-sell. But we should, at least, be at kind of where we are today in 75/25. And then I think
there's kind of upside from that over time.
And I do think the spread on the Private Bank assets is very significant today given the high percentage of low
cost deposits in there. We haven't really seen the loans come on in size yet, but, generally, capital call lines tend
to be priced with a nice return. And I think some of the other business lending and HELOCs and things [ph] that
we'll (01:01:29) maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well. So, I think if you look at
kind of mature private banking models, to have a 20% to 25% return on equity is realistic.
I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add to that at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think it's well said. I won't repeat it. I just would reiterate that I think the performance in Q4 is in line with what we
would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time that, obviously, more
loan growth on the come and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale. And recall, our
targets end of 2025 are $11 billion in deposits, $9 billion in loans and $10 billion in AUM. So if we deliver that
profile and kind of the expense composition, the profitability profile we're seeing so far is aligned with that return.

first half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then following up, Bruce, maybe some thoughts on – from your perspective on what we might see
in this Basel III endgame. Obviously, there's a lot of talk about scaling it back and maybe it's going to be a
delayed implementation because of all the changes. There's a big focus, as you know, as we all know, on the
operating risk in the capital markets businesses.
But for the regional banks, it seems like it's more that numerator, including the unrealized bond losses than the
available-for-sale portfolio. But any thoughts from – for Citizens, how you might benefit from a scale back of what
was initially proposed and what will be the final proposal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say that for banks of our size, the things that we've focused the most on have been RWA increases
to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply – the appetite to lend in those areas, because
it would erode the economics. So things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines
attracting capital and small business lending attracting more capital, I think those flaws in the proposal have been
well-chronicled.
And even though they don't result in a meaningful RWA inflation for us, I mean, we're stewards of the US
economy and we'd like to see those things adjusted. That's been for kind of banks our size. I think the kind of
main thing at top of the list, I think the operational risk kind of increases – affect the bigger banks more. But
nonetheless, they seem to have a fairly big thumb on the scale. And so that likely, I think, will have a rethink. And
maybe those come down to some extent, that would benefit everybody, but probably, the big banks more than
banks like ourselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And maybe just to add – just a quick add to that is that even if it had gone – even if the Basel III endgame had
gone through as initially proposed, a very modest impact from a RWA standpoint on us. And as it relates to AOCI,
as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting that likely survives. But in our case, we are – we're at 9% by deducting
the AOCI opt-in and that's an incredibly strong number. So we sort of think about what's going on there is really
behind us and really in the run rate, if you will, when it comes to [ph] that (01:05:14).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that's a good point that John just raised, Gerard, is that, given the strength of our capital position,
both pre- and post-AOCI, we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts, but really not worry about them.
Many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up and getting in position and having to kind of hold back on
capital distribution, which is really not something that we're worried about given the capital strength. So we're
more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catch-up, which is a good position to be in.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Absolutely. In fact, Bruce, you bring up a good point in your guidance on the medium term for the total company,
legacy core ROTCE of 15% to 17%. You guys point out significant share repurchases. Should we interpret that to
be a combined dividend payout and buyback ratio of 100% of earnings, then, once we get the final rules and
we're all set to go? Is that a fair number [ph] to pull (01:06:15) for you guys, because you are well-capitalized?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think if you – hey, Gerard, if you go back to the time of the IPO, and that number has been over 100% and under
100% and all over the place. But if you just looked at like a 10-year average, almost 10 years, it's about 75%. And
so, having enough capital to actually grow business and lend to customers, you have to certainly work that into
the equation. But to the extent, as John stated the priorities, dividend is number one, using capital to support
organic growth principally in the loan book, and then repurchasing shares. I think if we get our returns into that
level, we'll be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders, both through the dividend and through
consistent share repurchase. And we should be viewed as a capital return story.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I think we had a 95% capital return performance in 2023. So, it's in that 75% to 100% range over time.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just a follow-up to the down-beta question on deposits. A few of your peers have talked about how commercial
deposit rates are coming down or would come down quickly, but there's likely to be some more pressure on the
consumer side continuing from here. They've talked about basically consumers still moving towards higher rate
accounts. And given that you do have a big core consumer deposit franchise, I was wondering what you are
seeing right now and what your expectations are on consumer behavior as rates come down?

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Brendan, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. I'll take that. Well, let me start big picture and then give you a little color on Q4 and expectations. So,
yeah, we've been talking for years that the investments we've made in transforming the consumer deposit base
have truly been transformational for our performance. And I think that's what we're seeing here now that our
consumer book is performing at a worst case peer like. But certainly, there are signs that we may be
outperforming peers. When we look at benchmark, our DDA balances, we're almost 300 basis points better than
peer average this year and – or last year rather in 2023. And our net deposit growth was actually a couple of
hundred basis points better than peers as well, while our betas have been modestly better. So if you look at that
equation, better deposit growth, better beta, really grounded with an outperformance in DDA, that's a good place
to be. And I expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in 2024 for our relative
outperformance to sustain and we're seeing those signs already.
Having said that, on an absolute basis, what we saw in Q4 was a slowdown in consumers, deterioration in excess
stimulus. That's still going on a path of normalizing. So we're still seeing that continue. But the pace of
normalization has begun to slow. And I think we should see that sustain in the first half of the year as rates start to
tick down.
On the interest-bearing side, competitive dynamics haven't really shifted yet. It's still fairly aggressive out there on
CDs and money markets, but believe we've got more levers than most with Citizens Access as a platform where
we can contain interest-bearing growth on the higher cost side, not sort of put contagion, so to speak, into the full
retail bank to reprice all of our interest-bearing deposits, gives us a real competitive advantage and we're thinking
about the Private Bank in some ways in a similar way.
So we've got all the tools to compete. We do expect, as the rate curve follows as projected, interest-bearing
deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well. And we're starting to think about mix of balances.
We've got a lot of CDs that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that we'll be looking to have
more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage down-betas
over the course of the year. So all that is to say, I feel pretty good about how we are situated. We're starting to
see good dynamics with the consumer, expect to continue, and I've got a lot of confidence that we'll outperform
peers in whatever environment comes our way.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A

Right.

Manan Gosalia Q

Great. Thank you. And then just to follow up on credit, given the move lower and [ph] long in (01:10:57) rates, can
you talk about anything you're seeing in the non-office CRE portfolio, like maybe in multifamily? How do things
like the debt service coverage ratios look today versus a couple of months ago? And how do you expect that to
trend given where the forward curve is right now?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio, its characteristics, its relatively
small loan sizes, a lot of fixed term loans, good diversification geographically. And so we, I think, felt that loss
content there was going to be quite low. But now, obviously, with rates ticking down, that provides more kind of air
to us in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows. And so we feel that
it's helpful, but we weren't worried all that much previously. So, anyway, that's a...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would just hasten to add that it's very different than General Office. I mean, the capital markets are
still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties and that will just provide further tailwind to
that activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There's a lot of liquidity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There's liquidity there where buyers and sellers are still transacting. So it's a very different night and day
situation compared to General Office. And certainly, rates which won't have much of an impact maybe on the
General Office, will have a very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to
begin with.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
