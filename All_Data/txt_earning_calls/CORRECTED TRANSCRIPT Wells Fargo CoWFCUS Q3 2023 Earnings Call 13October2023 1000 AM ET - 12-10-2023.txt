I will now turn the call over to Charlie.

Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our
priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your
questions.
Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected progress we're making to improve our
financial performance. Revenue, pre-tax provision profit, net income, dilutive earnings per common share and
ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as
higher noninterest income, as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our
businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses.
As expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels and we increased our
allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio.
Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter, as higher rates and a slowing
economy have weakened loan demand and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions.
Average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago, driven by the consumer spending as well
as customers migrating to higher yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-
over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter.
Now, let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control
work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete
our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the dates the work
is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation.
The work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big-bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of
work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are
implementing changes throughout the life of the project and we track effectiveness along the way.
In numerous internal metrics we track, show that the work is clearly improving our control environment. But we will
not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead, even as we are making
progress. But I will repeat what I said in the past. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as
ours continues to grow, and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at
risk of further regulatory actions.
Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that needs to be remediated and these may
result in additional regulatory actions. We also continue to take steps to advance our business strategy, which
includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity
investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a
number of investments to better serve our customers.
As a leader in US middle market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients
with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle market clients will have
greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value
creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions.

Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our
network. But we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise. Last
week we announced we're expanding our branch network in Chicago where we only have seven branches today.
We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app; and in the third quarter we launched Stock Fractions,
giving WellsTrade clients the ability to buy fractions of companies' stocks to help build a diversified portfolio
regardless of stock price.
Just yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the
mobile app, LifeSync is our personized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was
launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync
will be visible to bankers to enhance needs-based conversations.
We also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, and recently added the ability for
customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing
investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile
adoption momentum adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since
first quarter of 2021.
We've also continued to make important hires to bring expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we're looking to
grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice
Chairman of Public Affairs, who is retiring at the end of this year, for all he's accomplished since he joined the
company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company and we benefited from his long experience in
both the public and private sectors. During his time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with
communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our
reputation both locally and nationally.
I'm pleased to have announced that Thomas Nides joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom
will be a close advisor to the senior management team on a range of issues, and he will work alongside our
business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across
the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us, as we continue to move the company ahead.
We continue to invest in our Corporate and Investment Banking business with new co-heads of Equity Capital
Markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also
hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management
segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in Consumer, Small and Business Banking. We also
continued to focus on better serving our communities.
During the third quarter, we published three reports that provided overview of the work we are doing to build a
sustainable inclusive future in the communities we serve, outline our strategic approach to managing risks
associated with climate change and deploying capital to support a transition to a low-carbon economy and
describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050 and for setting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment.
We continue to make progress on our Special Purpose Credit Program, initiative we announced last year to help
drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We
recently expanded our Special Purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers, with Wells Fargo
mortgages to refinance at a lower-than-market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African-
4

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer
engagement.
We also announced that we're offering a $10,000 Homebuyer Access grant that will be applied towards down
payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live in, who are purchasing homes in certain underserved
communities in eight metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers in Wells Fargo branches,
including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower
communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one
coaching.
Looking ahead, the US economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor market and strength
in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without
signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we
remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there's still significant uncertainty ahead.
Regarding capital, the Basel III Endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected. It's a
complicated set of rules, but at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our
RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that
we were hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules
during the 120-day comment period.
Additionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we've come into
this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers.
However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating
actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules.
At this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1, as appropriate, increasing our
dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, finalization of the proposed
rules and economic conditions.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per
diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349
million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior-period tax matters.
Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage
points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the
second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14-basis-point benefit from the sale of certain private equity
investments and lower risk-weighted assets, were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.
During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well
for the anticipated increases related to the Basel III Endgame proposal released in the third quarter. Based on
where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in
required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written, after factoring the growth in RWAs and the
resulting decline in our stress capital buffer, as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
Importantly, this is an early estimate subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the
impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio,
while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized.
Turning to credit quality on slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continued to increase, up 4 basis points
from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly
from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans, as lower losses in our commercial and industrial
portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate.
We had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans
outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to
focus on monitoring and de-risking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures. As we highlighted in the
past, each property situation is different and there remain variables that could determine performance, which is
why we regularly review this portfolio.
As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second
quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries while
our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses, with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up
from the second quarter seasonal lows.
Nonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter, as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual
loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial, as well as modest declines across all consumer
portfolios. The decline in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and pay-downs,
which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The
increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual
loans.
Moving to slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter, primarily for
commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by
lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we
shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter.
However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for Commercial Real
Estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We have not seen significant increases in charge-offs in
our Commercial Real Estate office portfolio yet. However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we
continued to increase the coverage ratio in our CIB, Commercial Real Estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end
of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter.
On slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and
a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other
portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan
yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher
interest rate environment.
Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our Consumer and
Wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding

alternatives. Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and
Investment Banking.
As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter to 136
basis points, with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates.
However, the pace of the increase has slowed and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits
decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29%, but remained above pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to net interest income on slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from year
ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter
was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and the impact of
higher interest rates. Last quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to
approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of
the year.
We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022,
with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline
in net interest income in the fourth quarter is primarily driven by our assumption for additional deposit outflows
and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing,
including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits.
Turning to expenses on slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses
and increased 1% from the second quarter, driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-
related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectation for full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding
operating losses, to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or
approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime
costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves.
We've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in second quarter
and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count, and attrition has
remained low which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through
our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.
Additionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year is finalized in the
fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we had
outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results.
Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 10. Consumer, Small
and Business Banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago, as higher net interest income driven by the impact
of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we
rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we're making in our Chicago branch network, and we're
also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network.
Additionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches creating a fast and easy
experience for customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from year ago.
Home Lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income, driven by
lower originations and servicing income which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We

continue to reduce head count in Home Lending in the third quarter down 37% from a year ago, and we expect
staffing levels will continue to decline.
Credit Card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances partially offset by introductory
promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the
past year and remain above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong up 22% from a
year ago, reflecting the continuing success of our new products and increased marketing.
Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continued to be better than what we were booking historically. While
the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers
that are new to Wells Fargo. Auto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread
compression and lower loan balances. Personal Lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan
balances.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from the year ago and
18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year,
including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. We did
not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter.
The size of our auto portfolios declined for six consecutive quarters and balances were down 9% at the end of the
third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 24% from a year ago reflecting credit-
tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continued to shift towards higher
FICO scores reflecting in credit-tightening actions we've taken over the past year.
Debit card spending increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel,
home improvement and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from the year ago.
All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel which rebounded after declining in the second quarter.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year
ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue
increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy
investments.
Average loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in asset-based
lending and leasing. Average loans were down 1% from the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market
Banking. After increase in the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels
similar to a year ago.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from year ago driven
by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and
higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we
continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets
improve.
Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and
higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets
revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products
and foreign exchange.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
We've had strong trading results for three consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the
investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business. Average loans were down 5% from the
year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand, payoffs and modestly lower line
utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter.
On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by
higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago
driven by lower deposit balances, as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives as
well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared with both the second quarter and a
year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter.
As a reminder, the majority of Wealth and Investment Management advisory assets were priced at the beginning
of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1 which were higher from a year ago.
Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1 which were also higher from a
year ago, but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago
primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.
Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments,
including the investments in funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter
net income. Revenue declined $345 million from the year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the
valuation of our B2B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue.
In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect a continued improvement in our financial performance. During
the first nine months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pre-tax provision profit and diluted earnings
per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from
historical lows and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE
office loans and higher credit card loan balances.
We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our
capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. We will now
take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we will
take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the expenses, Mike. Obviously, improving efficiency has been a big goal
of yours. You made progress even while investing in regulatory. What are the additional opportunities to improve
efficiency from here as you head into 2024? I know you're probably not ready to give a guidance for 2024 yet. But
are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish? And any comments
you can give on that would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Sure. Thanks, John. First up, let's just make sure we keep it all in context, right? We set out a program
almost three years ago now to cut roughly $10 billion. And I think that's all still on track. We've brought head count
down 40,000 from – or closer to 50,000 from the peak back in 2025. So, sort of very good progress to date.
And I think as Charlie and I have both said over the last couple quarters, we still have more to do to make it more
efficient. And I would say, there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point.
Now, some have more opportunity than others. Some require investment in terms of automation and technology.
Some don't.
But I do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very
disciplined approach to every single area of the company saying, what are we going to do to continue to drive
more efficiency there while we make investments as well. And we highlighted some of those that we've been
making on, in the prepared remarks. But I think it's the same mindset we've been bringing to it now for the last few
years, and I think we're going to continue to do that. Where that ultimately ends up, we'll share – for next year,
we'll share with you in January like we always do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Fair enough. And then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter, are you building in
assumptions? You mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions. Are they assuming that things
accelerate from here or are similar to what you've seen this quarter? It seems like a pretty big sequential decline.
Just kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No. Look, I think, as we've talked about over the last – it feels like forever, but certainly the last four, five,
six quarters now, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both deposits and pricing will
shape up, whether it's all the quantitative tightening, all of the – any competitive reactions we may see from
others. And so, I think we continue to think that we're going to see these trends appear at some point.

Now, we've been pleasantly surprised to-date this year that it hasn't progressed as fast as we thought it would.
But at some point, it will. And so, hopefully we'll find ourselves in a position where it doesn't move as maybe fast
as we've modeled in terms of pricing. But we still – all those trends are going to happen and are happening as you
look at shifts between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing. You're seeing deposit costs continue to increase.
And on the consumer side, you see people spending their money. And so, exactly at what pace those things are
all going to keep going is – we certainly modeled it. But we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit
under a bunch of different scenarios, and this is the same.

Operator: The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So wanted to start, Charlie, because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially
evolving. The inflation RWA from Basel III Endgame that you guided to, does bring your CET1 minimum to 8.5.
You alluded, subtly, mind you, to the possibility of managing to a lower target. Since 150 bps management
cushion does feel excessive, what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion
than peers and maybe continue to run at or above 10%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, let me just – I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Mike. I was not trying to give any direction about where we
thought the appropriate buffer would be. We're just trying to be very factual about where we are. And once
everything is finalized, we'll determine what the right buffers are and we'll communicate those. So please, don't try
and read any more into what I said other than just that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And I think, Steve, I know your estimate might be 150 basis points. But I think what we've talked about over
time is that, at least at this point we've been saying, our buffer's probably closer to 100% – 100 basis points over
wherever the right minimum might be. And that may evolve, as Charlie said.
I think as you look at Basel III, the increase in RWAs is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious,
whether it's operational risk plus some of the other factors. But operational risk is certainly going to be one of the
bigger pieces of it. And so, I really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
We're hopeful that there'll be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the
capital requirements to the risk, while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well. And
so, we're going to engage as we go there. But one of the factors that we've talked about now for a while in terms
of how big our buffer should be is, is that we needed the rules to be finalized.
And so, could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past?
Potentially, but I think we have to get there and get these finalized. And then, we'll also take actions once we have
good clarity on what's going to change or not change as we go over the next year. So, I mean, we're probably 9
months to 12 months away from getting a final rule, and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out.

Thanks for the color. And, Mike, for follow-up, just on the trading business, it continues to surprise positively
versus expectations. You cited some of the investments that you've made, the benefits of volatility. But with
revenues running multiples above what we've seen in prior years, and that $1 billion-plus bogey being reached for
three consecutive quarters, was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting $1 billion-plus
as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldn't be
underwriting go forward. Just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be, given
some of the investments you've made scaling of that business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I'll take that. Look, I think, we've – as we said, we've just been methodically investing in the capabilities with
a focus on supporting our core clients more than – with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of
what we do in a way that just doesn't fit who we are. And so, I think that's what you've seen us try to do there in
those businesses, so businesses like FX and rates and just – it's sort of methodically sort of adding people in a
couple slots or improving technology.
And we've certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year. So as you know, that could change
pretty quickly one way or the other. But I think as we look at some of these businesses, what we're focused on is
just adding more clients, more flows, more – incrementally each month and each quarter. And so, whether it ends
up being $1 billion plus or minus per quarter, I think we'll see as we go. But we're pretty pleased with what we've
seen so far. And there isn't a big onetime event that happened in the quarter that drove the results. And so, that's
good to see as well.
And you're also not seeing big growth in market risk RWA as we do this as well. And so, that's part of what we've
been trying to do as well, is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that we're getting paid for the
exposure and the risk we've got there. And so, we're happy to see that it's starting to come together. And we're
under no illusions though that three quarters is like a success, right? We've got to do this over a long period of
time and continue to add capabilities and clients.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, all. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe, Mike, you could spend another moment sort of
discussing RWA mitigation in light of the Fed capital proposal. And I guess, specifically, I was hoping for maybe a
little more color. I know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks, but the sale of the $2 billion in private
equity. And then, maybe if you could also discuss the newer agreement with Centerbridge for direct lending, just
sort of how all these factor into your thinking here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. When you look at mitigation – yeah, I'll just give you some examples of the types of things we're thinking
about. So when you look at security finance transactions, you have collateral haircut floors that get implemented.
And I don't want to get too technical on it, but there's some technical requirements there that just don't seem to
make sense to us. But if they do get implemented as written, we'll adapt and we'll change the way we've – what
collateral we require from clients to do trades or we'll reprice them.
And so, there'll be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that, that it gets very, very technical
for each of the underlying deals. I know others have talked about this, too. We'll have to decide how much tax
equity investing we do in renewables. If the risk weights hold there, just – the math just doesn't make sense from
a return perspective, and so we'll probably have to do less – we'll probably do less of those. And so, there's a
number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios, just don't make sense. And we'll
make the adjustments as we need to.
Now, we're also in a position where we've got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks,
right? Our capital levels today are there with a buffer already. And so, we have the flexibility to handle it however
we think makes sense for each of the underlying businesses. And what we want to make sure we do is like we're
building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time.
So, it's not about necessarily walking away from clients; it's about finding ways to serve them in ways that both
make sense for them and from a return perspective for us. But it's going to be a very, very granular conversation.
Some of it will be repricing. You got 364-day revolvers that will need to be repriced. There's a whole bunch of very
technical things like that that will get done over time once the rules finalize.
Switching to the partnership we have with Centerbridge. Look, we have been getting demand from clients for a
while now in the middle market kind of mid-corporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need,
where it likely wouldn't make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway. And so, instead of telling clients
we can't help them or having them go direct to somebody else, we built the partnership with Centerbridge that
allows us to remain an advisor to a client and help them solve a problem they may have.
And so, that's the way we're thinking about it, and we're excited to work with Centerbridge and that team. And
they're a very high-quality team, have done a lot over time. And I think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to
help us provide solutions for clients. And so, it's early and it'll grow over time hopefully, and hopefully clients will
see it in the same way.

Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, maybe as a follow-up, you might want to revisit – something to revisit the NII
discussion for a bit. Certainly, appreciate all the comments on continued mix shift and deposit pricing pressure.
But I guess, as we get to this level at the end of the year, is the thought that there would still be, on balance,
downward pressure on NII beyond there? Or, as you see it, is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity
that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I mean, we'll see. I think we do need to wait until we get towards the end of the year and into January for us
to give you a real view on 2024. I mean, I think, look, the last number of quarters just show over and over and
over that. There's a lot still to play out here. And to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year, I think would
be a mistake at this point. But look, it's the same drivers we've been talking about for a while, right? It's like,
what's going to happen with deposits, the mix, the pricing. And then to a lesser degree, right now, it's loan growth.
But it still matters over a long period of time as well.

Operator: The next question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit? And then, I guess,
specifically in credit card, thoughts there. I know you've been leaning into it, and it's had real good growth. And I
think it's still only about 5% of your loan book. But wondering your thoughts of, is this really the right time to be
leaning into credit card maybe elsewhere kind of later cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I'll start with credit card and come back to the broader point. So, we started on a journey to transform the
card business back in the fourth quarter of 2019, so right after really Charlie started. And what we've done since
then is really refreshed – almost completely refreshed the product line. We still have a little bit more to do there.
And so, part of what you're seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people
want to buy. And you're seeing – we had really good new account growth in the quarter, probably our best quarter
in quite some time. And so, it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it and that's the key
driver I think of what you're seeing here.
On the credit side on the new originations, the new accounts we're adding are really good relative to the back
book. And when you look at both and even when you dig a little bit deeper there, the majority of them are still
Wells Fargo Bank customers, but we're seeing more and more traction with non-Wells Fargo customers, so first
time customers. And when you look at those first-time to Wells customers, the credit profile is really good. And so,
we feel comfortable with like the risks that's being added there. And we're going to continue to look for pockets of
risk; and if we see them, we'll tighten it down. But in terms of what we're seeing in originations, we feel good
about what we're seeing so far.

Just more broadly on credit, we've said now for probably the last four or five quarters, we've been kind of
incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while, whether it's really across the board in
home lending, auto, card, personal loans, really every single one of them had some credit tightening. And it's
been a bit incremental over the last four or five quarters.
And so, I would still sort of think of that as like taking that last 1% or 2% or 3% of origination out that doesn't make
sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment. It's not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or
the underlying box that we're operating in. It's really sort of modest and incremental. And then, on the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And just to be clear, I mean it's – and it's the very basic stuff. It's just upping the lower FICO boundaries. It's
layered risks. And so, it's just – as you continue to make these changes, we're just continuing to do the same
types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that. It's just kind of the smart tightening.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And then outside of consumer, really the only place that we've meaningfully tightened credit over the last
couple of years or few years is Commercial Real Estate. And other than that, I think there is probably some minor
tinkering, but we haven't really changed the appetite much outside of Commercial Real Estate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just clarification on the severance costs. Can you give us what the absolute
amount was this quarter? I think you give us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter. But what was the
absolute level this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. There wasn't a lot a year ago, so it's not far off of the total. So small difference, but there wasn't a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Michael P. Santomassimo A

attrition rates that we're seeing.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the Commercial Real Estate front, I know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve
and the CIB from 8.8% to 10.8%. Can you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal
drivers for the loan loss reserve increase? Do you think you could have incremental increases here? And maybe
cite some of the office revaluations you've seen as you have [indiscernible] (00:46:34) the underlying collateral
change hands or reappraisals. If you can give us some color there as well. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Sure. The hard part of office right now is that there aren't a lot of trades happening yet, right? There's a few
in certain cities, and they're all a little bit different in their complexion. So, you still have somewhat limited
information and price discovery in a lot of places.
And so, we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be
worth in a bunch of different scenarios. And then, it's feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch
up where we're seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated. So, that's certainly bringing in
different data points as we look at it.
And as we look at the quarter, we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our
best to come up with what we think the different range of loss could look like here. And that's what's embedded in
the results. Hopefully, we end up being conservative. But nonetheless, it's possible that this plays out this way.
And so, we haven't really seen any losses of significance yet, but we will. And it just takes some time for it to play
out for each of these underlying situations, probably longer than any of us would hope. You'd hope that you could
bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life. But it's really looking at all the
data points, the limited sales, the new appraisals are coming through, and then our own analysis for each of the
underlying properties.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. Thanks, Mike. And then, separately but also within Commercial Real Estate, we're getting more
and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply
issues in certain markets. Can you just comment there? Are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to
underlying reserve for that book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, not a lot. I mean, you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in
certain places. But it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time. We're not seeing real systematic
stress in the portfolio at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. And if I can ask just one last one on the head count cuts that you mentioned. You're looking at every

the contracts with the consultants in the risk overhaul area at all? Thanks.

Yeah. And just to be clear like, we're not cutting head count related to that. In fact, it's probably the opposite when
you look over the past bunch of quarters. The only thing which goes up and down is, depending on where we are
with work with outside consultants, that number will go up or down in a given quarter. But we've also said, if we
can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner, we're going to. So as we think about our efficiencies,
that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future.

Operator: The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the revenue side. As a follow-up to Chubak's line of questioning, I think
not only the trading numbers come better this year, but also investment banking. And so, hear you loud and clear
about the cyclicality of the trading business. But I guess, help us get a sense of, if the industry wallet, for example,
returned to 2019 levels, do you think that you're going to have a generally higher share of revenues in Capital
Markets versus 2019?
And sort of the sub-question to that is, as we think about the investments you have already made, what are the
other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside where it's not quite optimized yet in terms of its
revenue production? And obviously, everybody's thinking about you've mentioned card, and also everybody's also
thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Well, let me take a shot at that. Listen, I think the answer is, to your question on share, without getting
overly specific, yes. We think – when you look at where we stand on our growth in our Corporate and Investment
Banking share, whether it's on the trading side or whether it's on the fee-related side, our shares have grown.
And certainly, within the fee-based side of the business, we do hope they continue to grow. That's driven by the
investments that we're making, and investments meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities, and we've
17


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect, and we're going to be tracking
to that.
Just a reminder, certainly, when we brought some of the people on, they bring a lot of clients with them. Some do
transactions in the short term, and we've been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters just as we
brought some people on. But these are relationship-based businesses, and transactions don't occur every single
quarter, so we would expect our share to continue to grow. And as a reminder, without taking any additional risk
overall because we're taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have.
When we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company, we just go business by
business. Absolutely in our Consumer, Small and Business Banking segment, because we've basically been
treading water there, as we stabilize that business going back to the issues that we had there, which was an
incredibly difficult thing to do, and we did. And we've not been on our front foot in that business. We're going to do
it very different way than this company did it historically. But there are opportunities to be on the front foot and
actually grow share on an organic basis.
And so, incredibly excited of that opportunity. Not excited as I said about growing share in mortgage, that's not
where we are after. And we've talked about where we're going there. Auto, it's about returns, not growth. So don't
look for a lot of growth there unless the dynamics change in the business. Mike spoke about card. We're
incredibly energized by the evidence that shows with our brand and our relationships. When you put a great
product out there, we get positive selection and real growth.
And by the way, look at our spend numbers. I mean, you want to see like the impact of what it means, just look at
the spend that we're seeing, which is much higher than the industry levels. Our Wealth business, as you pointed
out, no question. Also, treaded water for a long period of time. We're attracting people and teams. We're rolling
out new products, so we feel really good about the opportunities that are there.
And in the Middle Market segment where it's a little bit more business as usual, because it is such a strong
franchise for us, even there, we look back at our asset-based lending businesses and the things that we acquired
from GE. They ran as stand-alone businesses here for a long period of time, and we didn't bring the entire product
set of Wells Fargo to those customer bases. Under Kyle Hranicky, Kristin Lesher and Mary Katherine DuBose are
diligently working through that and bringing the Investment Banking product to the – the entire Commercial
Banking product.
So, I mean, I could go on. It should be broad based. Most of it, by the way, I'll point out in terms of when we see
opportunities, it is fee-based growth, not because we've dictated that, but just because we focused a lot on NII as
a company historically and we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about that'll play out over a
period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I think that excitement is clear, Charlie. And my second question is, given all of that and taking a step
back, I totally think it's too early, I agree with you, to give anything on 2024 expenses. But more broadly
discussing, do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point? Because on one hand, Mike was
saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized.
On the other, I think you guys mentioned that the head count's not going the other way, and perhaps it's really
some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down. But I'm wondering if you get asked about
18


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
expenses in a framework of flat, but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be [ph] under comm
(00:56:28).
I'm wondering how you think about, as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that
15% ROTCE, let's just put Basel III Endgame aside in terms of the denominator, how do you balance some of the
shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue
momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining, what is that revenue momentum that you
seem to be so excited about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Let me start and, Mike, you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well. So I
think, first of all, we think about it as two separate exercises that we go through. And it's very timely because
we're in the middle of going through the exercise for next year as most other companies are which is, this
company is not efficient, like period, end of story. And I've described this.
Even with all of the reductions that we've made, it's not surprising because, as you peel the onion back, other
things present themselves. And so, just you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that. But
when we sit around as a management team, we feel great about the progress. And there's no clearer way to see
that than in the head count numbers which ultimately drive the expense of the company. And if we stood here and
told you we were going to drive the head count down that much in this period of time, I'm not sure you would've
believed us. And so, when we say we're going to do something, we really do mean it.
And so, when we sit around with the team, there are many more efficiencies to get. And we're diligently working
through those. And then separately from that it's, when we talk about making investments in the place, are we
getting the payoff for it? And so, whether it's the marketing in the card business where we're spending more
money on marketing than we had in the past. And we feel great about, as Mike pointed out, not just the volumes
that we're getting, but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that.
And so, we'll do that with each and every thing. And ultimately, we need to make a decision, as we finalize the
process of the budget, on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out. We're well aware of what
shareholders are looking for. We're well aware that the expense side of this company is an important equation in
what investors look at us, in terms of where – unlocking value. And we hear it and we see it.
And wherever we come out, when we talk to you about our guidance for next year, we will explain why we got to
where we are. It's going to include efficiencies. It's going to include investments. Where that turns out, we'll
explain it. And I think so far, we've been as clear and as transparent as we can be. And if it makes sense, you'll
like it. And if it doesn't, you'll tell us. But so far, we've been able to have alignment there.
But overall, it's a long way of saying, it's not lost on us that we have opportunities both to reduce expenses and to
invest. But making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us.
And we have to prove that there's revenue growth there, supporting investments that we make.

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good morning. Just, Mike, for you. A follow-up on credit. On the C&I side, nonaccrual charge-offs staying
relatively flat, I guess, as we look through. Just talk to us in terms of, when you look at that C&I book, is the
impact of the Fed rate hikes felt by your customers? And how are you seeing that evolve? Is your expectation
right now – you talked about, the economy being resilient, are you seeing any soft spots on the C&I book where
you're seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No. Look, I think, first, you're seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers, which are pretty much in
check, that aren't moving much and down in some cases. So people are building less inventory given where rates
are. They may be making decision on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses.
And so, you're seeing that come through in loan growth, which is sensible from their perspective. I think when you
look across the portfolio, there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or
different idiosyncratic issues. But across the portfolio, the credit quality's still good.

I think they certainly felt it so far, right? I mean, most of them have variable rate loans that they service, right? And
obviously, the longer rates stay high, they'll maybe feel it more. But certainly, I think they've been impacted.

Got it. And just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks. Clearly, big reset lower. When like you
have excess capital, you probably have visibility on the worst case on Basel Endgame. It's very rare that banks
have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lows. You're creating a tangible book. How do you think
about outside of CCAR and SCB in terms of near-term pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to
what we did this quarter?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I mean, we're not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing. We have a process we go
through every quarter to look at all of what's happening. First, it's like how are we going to support clients? What's
demand we're seeing? What kind of risks are out there? In the fourth quarter, we have the FDIC special
assessment potentially coming. And so, each quarter there's going to be a whole range of things that we're going
to go through, and then we'll decide on pacing.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning. Thank you. Mike, can you share with us, you and your peers as well as investors, we've all been
surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higher-yielding deposits is going slower than
expected. Is there any categories within your deposit base, whether it's just your regular consumer deposits or
high-net-worth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits, that are moving more slowly? And I know you
said you expect it to happen. But is there something that says, it could pick up real quickly in the next six months?
Or is it just a gradual increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Gerard, I think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses. I think in the Wealth business, it
moved quite quickly in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were. And that is now moderated. So, it's
good to see that that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple
quarters.
On the Consumer side, the majority of the deposits that we've got sit in accounts with less than $250,000. And so,
to some degree, these are – to a large degree, these are operational accounts for folks. And so, there's some
portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in their accounts to
live and operate every day.
And so, I think what's – so I think we'll see, right? And I think we're all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point
with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there and quantitative tightening happening. And
so, I think we need to be prepared for it to change. Exactly at what pace and over what period of time, we'll see.
But we certainly haven't seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago for sure.

Very good. And then as a follow-up, since you and Charlie have come on board, Wells has really done a very
good job in returning that excess capital. I understand everything that's going on today, and you guys described it
in your comments. Can you share with us, is there a buffer? Whenever the final numbers come out, are you guys
planning to keep a 100-basis-point buffer above that? Or any color there?

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. We haven't decided exactly what the buffer will look like after Basel III is implemented. But so far, what
we've said a number of times is that 100 basis points is about where we've been targeting. Obviously, we've been
running above that for a while. But as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out, we'll
probably talk about that more. But I would think that the 100 basis points, at least for now, is sort of the bottom
end of the range.
