Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Miles, and good afternoon everyone. And as Miles said welcome to Western Alliance's second quarter
earnings call. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the unique benefits of Western Alliance's national
commercial business strategy to position Western Alliance as one of the country's premier growth commercial
banks that can consistently generate leading balance sheet and earnings growth with superior asset quality
across economic cycles.
This quarter, the bank produced record net revenues, PPNR and EPS, while expanding on net interest margin
generating the highest return on tangible common equity in the bank's history and returning asset quality to pre-
pandemic levels.
For the second quarter, Western Alliance earned total net revenues of $506.5 million, net income before merger
and restructuring charges of $236.5 million and adjusted EPS of $2.29, an increase of 20.5% from the prior
quarter. These results benefited from a $14.5 million reversal of credit loss provision, consistent with our excellent
asset quality results. Strong balance sheet growth continued with loans rising $2 billion excluding PPP loans or
29% on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits by $3.5 billion or 37%.
Our deposit and loan pipelines are very active and total assets now stand at $49.1 billion. Net interest income
totaled $370.5 million, up $53.2 million or 16.8% for the quarter, as robust balance sheet growth, rising NIM and

excess liquidity deployment significantly move the earnings needle. Strong loan growth led to a 5.5% or $1.5
billion increase in average loan balances quarter-over-quarter.
Additionally, after closing the AmeriHome acquisition on April 7, we added $4.5 billion in held-for-sale mortgages,
primarily GSE qualified, or 12.4% of our average interest-earning assets, yielding approximately 3.21% as an
alternative to cash or mortgage-backed securities. Optimizing our interest-earning asset mix helped NIM expand
from 3.37% to 3.51% in the second quarter.
Fee income was a record $136 million, representing 27% of total revenue as we began to integrate and optimize
AmeriHome's mortgage banking related activities throughout the rest of Western Alliance. Mortgage banking
related income was $111.2 million in the second quarter, demonstrating our ability to adjust win share as gain on
sale margins fluctuate and maintain earnings. I think it's worth reemphasizing that what most attracted us to
AmeriHome's business model was their low cost and flexible mortgage production and servicing ecosystem. Their
leverages are complementary, corresponded and consumer direct channels to feed and enhance value
throughout Western Alliance's commercial businesses while minimizing risk.
Business-to-business correspondent mortgage lenders have several business levers and the flexibility to sustain
earnings throughout the rate – or throughout rate and economic cycles. Despite the evolving mortgage sector
fundamentals, AmeriHome continues to meet our expectations and contributed $0.39 to EPS in Q2. We have
optimized AmeriHome's balance sheet to Western Alliance capital levels with a servicing portfolio of $57.1 billion
in unpaid balances – well, yeah, UPB, sorry. Expanded the number of correspondent sellers by 57 to 819 and
taken advantage of market dislocations to drive value.
In the second quarter since April 7, when the transaction closed, AmeriHome generated $20.7 billion in loan
production or 25% above levels for the full quarter period a year ago and only down 3.6% from Q1 with 47% from
traditional home purchases. Gain on sale margin was 64 basis points for the quarter, in line with 2019's 63 basis
points. Given the flexibility of AmeriHome's business model, we continue to stand by our full year guidance of
$1.41.
Asset quality continued to improve this quarter as the economic recovery extended in breadth. Total classified
assets declined $43 million in Q2 to 49 basis points of total assets, which is lower than Q1 2020's levels on both a
relative and absolute dollar amount just as the pandemic impact was beginning to be felt. For the quarter, net loan
charge-offs were zero.
Finally, Western Alliance is one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and a
record return on average tangible common equity of 1.86% and 28.1%, respectively, which will continue to
support capital accumulation to strong capital levels. Tangible book value per share modestly declined to $32.86
from $33.02 as goodwill and intangibles doubled to $611 million in Q2 mainly from recognizing the AMH platform
value.
At this time, Dale will take you through the financial performance.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks. Thank you, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated adjusted net income of $236 million or
$229 million adjusted earnings per share, up 22.9% and 20.5% from the prior quarter. This is inclusive of a
reversal credit provisions that Ken mentioned of $14.5 million and excludes pre-tax merger and restructuring
expenses of $15.7 million related to AmeriHome.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Additionally, pre-provision net revenue of $277 million, rose 37% quarter-over-quarter, excluding those same
charges. After the AmeriHome acquisition, total net revenue grew $169.5 million during the quarter to $506.5
million, an increase of over 50% from the prior quarter. Net interest income rose $53 million during the quarter to
$370.5 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year, primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and
deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets. Average earning assets increased $4.1 billion, while lower-
yielding cash proportion held at the Fed fell to 4.4% from 15%.
Non-interest income increased $116.3 million to $136 million from the prior quarter and now represents 27% of
total revenue due to mortgage banking-related income of $111 million from AmeriHome. Within this category, net
loan servicing revenue was in negative $20.8 million as high refinance activity drove accelerated amortization of
servicing rights, but was far exceeded by gain on sale of mortgage loans. Pre-AmeriHome WAL contributed 18%
non-interest income or $24.8 million in the second quarter compared to $19.7 million in the first, supported by $7
million of income from equity investments.
Non-interest expense, excluding merger and restructuring charges, increased $94.5 million mainly due to the
acquisition of AmeriHome, which increased compensation costs as we added approximately 1,000 new members
to the WAL team, as well as new costs related to loan servicing and origination expenses.
Turning now to our net interest drivers, you can begin to see the benefit of AmeriHome to our strategy to expedite
and optimize the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets as we added $4.5 billion in loans held
for sale yielding 3.2% as opposed to cash yielding 10 basis points.
Investment yields improved 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.47% while on a linked quarter basis, loan
yields excluding HFS declined 11 basis points following ongoing mix shift towards residential loans and a slight
reduction in non-commercial real estate loan returns. Interest bearing deposit costs were flat from the prior
quarter at 22 basis points. The total cost of funds increased 8 basis points to 27 based on the – due to the
issuance of $600 million of subordinated debt and the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings. The spot rate for
total deposits which includes non-interest bearing was 11 basis points. We expect funding costs have generally
stabilized at these levels.
As a result, net interest income grew $53.2 million to $370.5 million during the quarter or 24% year-over-year as
average earning assets increased $4.1 billion. Cash as a portion of average interest earning assets fell to 4.4%
from 15% in the quarter which drove expansion by 14 basis points to 351. Additionally excluding the impact of
PPP loans the margin would have increased to 22 basis points. Our efficiency ratio rose to 44.5% from 39% in the
first quarter mainly driven by the addition of AmeriHome employees and increase in incentive compensation
costs.
As mentioned on our first quarter call, we expected the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid-40s as a result of the
acquisition Pre-provision net revenue increased $75 million or 37% from the prior quarter and 35.4% from the
same period last year. This resulted in pre-provision net revenue return on assets of 2.31% for the quarter an
increase of 28 basis points compared to 2.03% in the first quarter.
This continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing
balance sheet growth, capital management actions or meet credit demands. Balance sheet momentum continued
during the quarter as loans held for investment increased to $1.3 billion or 4.6% to $30 billion and deposit growth
of $3.5 billion brought balances to $41.9 billion at quarter end.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
In all, total assets have grown 54% year-over-year as we approach the $50 billion asset level. Borrowings
increased $1.2 billion over the prior quarter to $1.8 billion, primarily due to $600 million subordinated debt
issuance as well as the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings.
Finally tangible book value per share decreased $0.16 over the prior quarter to $32.86, but increased 18% year-
over-year again driven by the AmeriHome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by Q2 earnings
and the issuance of common stock from our ATM of 700,000 for $70 million. Despite heightened competition and
pricing pressure, we continue to generate consistent, strong organic loan growth from our flexible national
commercial business strategy.
Loans held for investments grew $1.3 billion in the quarter or $2 billion excluding PPP payoffs of approximately
$700 million. A majority of growth this quarter was driven by an increase in residential real estate loans of $2
billion which now comprised 17% of total loans as we look to deploy excess liquidity and integrated new flow
arrangements from the recent Galton and AmeriHome transactions. This was supplemented by growth in capital
call lines of $162 million and construction and land loans of $89 million.
Turning to deposits, we continue to see broad-based core deposit growth across business channels. Deposits
grew $3.5 billion or 9.2% in the second quarter, driven by increases in non-interest bearing DDA of $2.6 billion
which now comprised 48% of our deposit base and savings and money market deposits of $534 million. Market
share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter along
with strong performance from regional commercial clients, robust fund raising activity in tech and innovation and
seasonal inflows from the HOA banking relationships.
Our asset quality continued to significantly improve this quarter. Total classified assets fell $43 million in the
second quarter to $238 million to 49 basis points of total assets. While our total classified assets ratio declined 16
basis points to 49 basis points due to continued improvement in COVID impacted clients. Finally, special mention
loans declined $69 million during the quarter to 1.35% of funded loans.
Similarly, quarterly net credit losses were negligible at $100,000 for the quarter or zero basis points of average
loans compared to a $1.4 million net loss in the first quarter. Our loan allowance for credit losses fell $16 million
from the prior quarter to $264 million due to continued improvement in credit trends and macroeconomic forecasts
and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates.
In all, total loan ACL to funded loans declined 9 basis points to 88 basis points or 91 basis points when excluding
PPP loans. For comparison purposes, the loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans was 84 basis points at
year end 2019, before CECL was adopted. Finally, given our industry leading return on equity and assets, we
continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain regulatory capital ratios. Our tangible
common equity to total assets of 7.1% and common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.2% were weighted down this quarter by
the AmeriHome acquisition and strong asset growth.
However, we issued 700,000 shares under our ATM shelf during this quarter and completed a $242 million credit-
linked note transaction that reduced risk weighted assets as we continue to look for ways to optimize our capital
levels to support ongoing growth.
Additionally, we completed $844 million in mortgage servicing rights dispositions and have already completed our
expected Q3 mortgage servicing sales. Capital levels should build from here. Inclusive of our quarterly cash
dividend payment of $0.25 per share, our tangible book value per share declined $0.16 for the quarter to $32.86
compared to an increase of 18% over the past 12 months.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
I'll now hand the call back to Ken for closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. At the midpoint of the year, I thought I would take this opportunity to reflect back upon our
performance. We deployed excess liquidity and turbo charged our net interest income. Year-to-date, non-PPP
loans have grown $3.6 billion and deposits have grown $10 billion or 2.75 times the amount of loan growth,
providing us an opportunity to deploy liquidity and growth and grow net interest income.
AmeriHome's past Q2 guidance and is tracking to full year projections, asset quality improved with substandard
special mention and non-accrual loans tracking downward with nearly no net charge-offs for the quarter. Return
on tangible common equity was 28.1% for the quarter. PPNR, a key metric for the company earnings power was
37.1%, grew 37.1% and we executed several capital raising transactions that Dale just mentioned.
So, for the second half of the year, I think you can expect loan and deposits to continue to grow between $1 billion
and $1.5 billion per quarter. Net interest income to grow quarter-to-quarter with incremental liquidity deployed into
loans and investments to overcome the interest drag of the new sub-debt and credit-linked note issuances. NIM
will continue to see some pressure as competition interest rates and loan mix nudge loan yields downward. PPNR
will follow net interest income and fee income growth and will continue to rise throughout the year.
Asset quality will remain steady although with net charge-offs tracking to prior year's performance or prior
quarter's performance. We continue to believe we will exit the year at a $9 EPS run rate level. And lastly, we will
deploy growth based capital strategy to support above trend balance sheet growth.
And finally, I would be remiss in the outlook section of the presentation if I didn't predict the Suns in 6. At this time,
Dale, Tim Bruckner who is sitting to my left here, our Chief Credit Officer and I are happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Brock, your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Hey, Ken, does that $1.5 billion loan guide include AmeriHome or is that got a standalone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
That's net loan growth for the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We don't really expect loan growth from AmeriHome. I mean AmeriHome, it has their held for sale piece of that,
that can fluctuate some. So I mean we're talking about held for investment loans, core loan growth, that's the $30
billion, that's what the $1.5 billion is attributable to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And shifting to AmeriHome, I think the biggest question is just overall origination volume and gain on
sale. Is this – and obviously the parts of the sector are under pretty heavy pressure. How do you look at things the
remainder of the year for volumes and gain on sale margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So I'll take half the question, I'll give the other half to Dale. First, we don't see any change to the guidance that we
gave which is $1.41. Of course we made $0.39 for this quarter. We do think there is some pressure in the
marketplace on volumes and on margins as you've seen. But, Brock, you gave me an opportunity here to answer
the question in a larger way. And I'd like to frame it the way we think about it here for everyone on the call. So I'm
going to take advantage of your question with a 1 minute answer here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
First, AMH contributed only 17% of our operating EPS. So it's not the majority of our earnings of our company
although today I assume it's going to be the majority of the questions, okay. We believe that you shouldn't
consider evaluate or compare AMH to other standalone mortgage companies and for the following reasons. One,
AMH has many tributaries that feed into the banks' net interest income. And this is acquisition rationale that we
had for making this purchase.

Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
So of course, the held for investment mortgages which absorbed excess liquidity and help us generate constant
loan growth, that's one. Number two, MSR loans. We'll be able to generate MSR loans that will accompany MSR
sales. In addition, we expect custodial deposits not bundled along with MSR sales that will help us fund in the
future investments and loans, again helping our net interest income grow.
We pay down the AMH outstanding credit lines with our excess liquidity. And once again that relates back to net
interest income, lower interest expense. We are going to be able to mine we think our HOA book for consumer
direct mortgage opportunities. We've purchased EBO loans, that's early buyout loans, that produce a positive
carry for us when we buy them but also produce a future gain on sale that's more equivalent to our consumer
direct business, i.e., a much larger gain on sale when we execute against this.
And then also AmeriHome has 800 warehouse lending clients and we haven't even begun yet to scratch the
surface of cross-selling into those warehouse lending clients, which in turn once again back to net interest
income, will generate greater net interest income for us. So, because of the interconnectivity with the bank, we
kind of see AmeriHome as a provider of not only loan growth, but really a provider of incremental net interest
income for us. And the acquisition of AmeriHome was designed to unlock and capture many of the revenue
streams that are generally hidden inside of a mortgage company.
And I hope that kind of gives you a larger perspective on how we think about AmeriHome and how we think it's
going to help enhance our earnings going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Brock, I know we had a conversation during the quarter about – seeing the volatility in this sector and what
that might mean for us. And we view AmeriHome as really a low-cost producer. And that's an enviable place to
be, because that puts them in a position such that when there is a musical chairs game going on, and I think there
is in this space at this time, they have the ability, capacity to expand their win rate and their buy rate. So they
were doing 7% in 2020, that number is about 12% to 13% today. It could go higher still.
And so you saw this pivot. It's like, okay, well, if the margins are under duress, then we can make it up in volume.
And so the gain on sale number was higher than we thought it would be, obviously, in part mitigated by this
acceleration of amortization that we had and the charge we ended up taking in the servicing revenue side. So
we're confident that that gain can continue. And again, just echo Ken's comment, I mean, the real power to
AmeriHome is not just what they can do on their own, but how much better they make the bank perform because
of this go-to class to fill up our liquidity that we have.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Dale, just wanted to follow up on the AmeriHome side, specifically that the mortgage servicing drag that you
mentioned. Can you just think about – give us a way to think about how that line should run going forward and
what the MSR impairment was in the quarter? Apologies if I missed that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I wouldn't – I'm not going to really rephrase it as an impairment that took place. I mean, so these models
are trying to predict human behavior. There's a lot, a lot of things that with the human behavior that aren't
necessarily picked up in these models.
And I think in particular, what you had in the first quarter, second quarter coming in, is you had kind of very
substantial volatility in the 10-year. So everyone thought, oh, gosh, we missed the bottom of the rates. And so that
actually, based on the models, it should see a slowdown in prepayment behavior because rates are higher. But,
no, that's not what happened. You have acceleration of prepayment behavior. And to me, my closest analogy is
it's like last call. It's like, you know what, it's 2:00 AM, you got to get in here, otherwise, you're going to miss out on
the lowest rates in a generation.
But then what happened, wow, we saw the 10-year get up to [ph] 1.90% (00:27:32) and now we're back to in the
[ph] 1.30% (00:27:34) range. And so we're getting now even an echo wave of that. So these prepayment speeds
have come in higher than we thought. That resulted in accelerated amortization. I'm not going to necessarily call
these impairments, but getting to your point a more normalized level, we would be looking for about a $10 million
quarterly positive in that servicing line.
You can't just say, oh, gosh, it's under by $30 million on a run rate basis, though, because of kind of the comment
I just made in terms of the gain on sale number is better probably because the servicing revenue was impaired.
Servicing revenue being impaired means there's a lot of refi business going on. There's a lot more activity
generating in the system. And so the GOS – the gain on sale opportunity is a bit higher. So it's not kind of a one-
for-one deal. But, yeah, in a steady state, we'd look for about a plus $10 million in that. I mean, it's in the revenue.
It's the contra revenue for a reason because it's not supposed to be a contra.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got you. So, I mean, you're standing by the $1.41 and so that implies basically this – the AmeriHome
contribution is running around $0.50 in the back half of 2021, correct?

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. And then just on your comment, Dale, if that capital will build from here, what does that assume,
like, if you guys beat – continue to beat your loan growth guide, will you just continue to use the at-the-market
offering or how should we think about, is that capital build line, is that – does that just assume that loans and
deposits grow $1.5 billion or you just use the ATM to true it up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Perhaps a little bit of both. But I think the balance sheet growth number is going to be higher – could be higher
than $1.5 billion and not even need to touch the ATM because, if you saw this last quarter, we were
overwhelmingly our loan growth was in residential. I don't think it's going to be that high proportionately to the
other categories going forward. But it will be preponderant. And that is a 50% asset class assignment.
And so based on that if you grow – if it was just that, you could grow $3 billion to get to $1.5 billion of risk-
weighted asset increases, which would be the same. So, our earnings this year were $230 million, based on that,
that would support $2.3 billion. [ph] If it was all (00:30:06) 50%, you can do the math on that. So I think we've got
more capacity with just capital generation that we have going on irrespective of ATM, which we could – we will
cap as needed. But right now we don't think that's going to be significant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just last one for me. The borrowings that you assume from AmeriHome, if I'm reading the
margin tables right, it appears there is about $595 million left at period end. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And so that's a lever that you also have to pull to help. I mean I'm assuming you are going to continue to pay that
down to zero.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. It is, some of those, a good chunk of those borrowings have high rates and are not coverable for an
extended period of time. So, don't look for that to drop off to zero as much as we'd like it to.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, just wanted to follow-up sort of around the loan growth guidance commentary. Last quarter you mentioned
getting to a 90% loan to deposit ratio. Maybe by the end of this year or early next, I don't know if that
contemplated another $3.5 billion of deposit growth as you saw this quarter. But just kind of curious how to think
about that 90% loan to deposit ratio number and maybe as that pertains to the held for sale loans, those came in
a bit higher than I was looking for. And then, is there incremental AmeriHome production that you plan to retain
above and beyond the $1 billion to $1.5 billion loan growth guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, so I mean a few things going on there. So yeah, I mean here – we wanted to get to kind of 90-ish or
whatever and we actually faded back a little bit because of the deposit growth was so robust. I don't have a
timeline of exactly kind of when we're going to get there. I do believe that we've got quarters in front of us where
loan growth is going to exceed deposit growth and that'll pull that up. When I talk about loan to deposit ratio, I do
not include the held for sale loans. I think held for sale is a much better comparison to the cash and investment
portfolio.
Those are – the average life of those loans is only a few weeks, and so it has a much more liquidity relative to
those other categories away from loans. So I do think that there – I mean, I like the held for sale portfolio because
basically you get the note rate on those loans predominantly, and yeah – they flip every three weeks. And so, it's
a very sensitive asset at the same time. But we will have to have a situation. To do that, we're going to have loan
growth and AmeriHome is going to be the primary conduit for this kind of well in excess of deposit growth. Right
now, deposit growth can just iterate. It looks – continues to look strong. So I'm not exactly sure when that's going
to be.
But we do have several things going on. One is we have feeds from AmeriHome today that go on our balance
sheet for higher yielding and origination activity as they have. These are things like vacation homes. They're going

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
to be coming out this quarter with a jumbo product that they had years ago, reintroducing that that can come up
on our balance sheet too, because it's a higher yield, low LTV, great credit quality as well as non-qualified
mortgages.
So we're getting these from the Galton relationships. We're getting these from our own warehouse clients. And as
Ken said, we're going to start mining warehouse clients among the 800 clients that AmeriHome has that they buy
from and with that, we can put in our own – our own direct conduits to feed our appetite for high quality, low LTV,
high yielding because they're not [ph] putable (00:34:18) to the GSEs resi mortgages.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit, maybe to the expense side of the equation. What
type of expense flexibility should we think about as the mortgage business sort of ebbs and flows over the next
several quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well we see – I mean there can be some flexibility within this. We think that the AmeriHome pivoted really well
and the volatility that took place in the second quarter in terms of finding ways to increase gain on sale even
though we had increased amortization. We're looking for that to continue. We're looking for the kind of the total
contribution which we mentioned on the previous call, $0.50 in Q3, $0.50 in Q4 plus $0.40 that puts $1.41 and
that's the same run rate that we have for getting to the number that we had for 2022. So I think there's multiple
channels to manage through that process with all the levers that can enumerate it.
And so I'm not too concerned about that. We're looking at kind of the total. I think we are going to stay in the mid-
40s. And I think that's pretty reasonable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Just final follow-up for me. Can you comment on the change in bond yields linked quarter? You guys
had some nice improvement there, I'm just kind of curious are you kind of things you might be buying. You saw
some nice improvement there and just curious you could provide any color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Maybe a couple of things. One of them we do have in our bond portfolio, low income housing bonds. We
think that's a growing sector likely to continue. Those yields are higher than certainly the average in our book. And
in the first quarter, again volatility – same issue comes out, it's a little bit of a different animal. But we had
increased amortization of premium on MBS bonds that we had purchased, that slowed down in the second
quarter. And so we had a less of a debit to hold against that and so that helped to bond yields pickup.

Yes, deposit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Well, warehouse lending grew about $1.7 billion. Our new deposit verticals grew a little over $300 million. HOA
business where the first quarter is very seasonally strong, still had a good quarter. This quarter grew $210 million.
And technology, which is awash in liquidity was up $936 million. So I would take a little exception that we didn't
have a great quarter, I mean, $3.5 billion.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
So yeah, I agree with you, it was a little bit softer this quarter. When we think about warehouse lending, we have a
couple other business lines to get wrapped in there. Our MSR lending and our note financing should offset some
of the weakness in warehouse lending overall or warehouse lending proper. But we think going forward as we
begin to rollout our cross-sell activity, which will be towards the end of the year to be quite honest. We think we'll
be able to gain or hold market share going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just lastly, the reserve came down again in the pace of loan growth, do you think we could have
bottomed on an absolute dollar basis of the reserve going forward? Or do you see [ph] continuously (00:39:10)
down, even though we're still getting growth in those lower costs – credit cost business lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I don't know I can call it bottom. I mean, I appreciate that we are going to hit the bottom on the reserve in dollars
certainly sooner than we are going to hit the bottom on the ratio. I mean negligible charge-offs this past quarter
throughout this recession and admittedly a very odd recession in terms of credit quality behavior primarily driven
by federal intervention. But that would point you that our reserve could still be very substantial. We had 7 basis
points of losses, the average remaining life on our loan book is 2.4 years.
If you said well, I can need only 2.4 years for a duration on 7 basis points, that's a 20 basis point reserve if that
were to be the math. Obviously, we're not getting anywhere near to there. But you could see how even on a dollar
basis it could continue to ebb. Most significantly is that even compared to our balance sheet pre-CECL is we've
been growing in these categories that have had historically zero and prospectively low if not zero anticipated
losses in low LTV residential loans, capital call lines, mortgage warehouse, public finance. And as that proportion
is growing larger and larger, that also tends to push the numbers lower.
I personally don't think that the outlook for the economy is going to improve in the near term is – dramatically is
the forecasted whether it was Moody's, whether it was Blue Chip in the second quarter. So, I don't know if we're at
the bottom or not, but I do think that certainly the preponderance of the reserve releases are behind us.

relative to buying a bond at these levels. I'm interested in kind of where you see that taking away your comfort
range is from that proportional piece of the loan book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so I mean, I think I first want to address this from our interest rate risk profile. So we have a very naturally
asset sensitive balance sheet compared to most. C&I loans are a big piece of what we've got. Even some of the
securities we've been purchasing have a variable rate element to them. And then our funding structure 48% DDA
very low in terms of CDs. And the administered rate categories like money market are client relationships. And I
think they're going to have lower than kind of mean beta of what you'd see.
So we start from a position that we can tolerate higher levels of residential. We've been below the peer group for
a long time which I'm going to paying at about 30% now at 17%, it has moved up significantly obviously. And I
think we're going to go to that 30% number and kind of see where we are. I think we see a lot of opportunity in
front of us in terms of improving yield. These are in low risk credit rates and with the deposit growth, we can kind
of do this. And this can – but I do think it's not going to be as sharply climbing as it certainly did this last quarter.
We are seeing increased breadth in terms of credit demand we believe. And so I think we're going to see a little
more balanced growth prospectively, but yeah, we're going to be moving up to 30%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. It's a great color. In terms of the liquidity, you guys, I think were one of the more aggressive in deploying it.
With cash around 4% to 5%, I mean what's the reasonable level that you need to run proportional to the balance
sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So as of right now, we have $3.4 billion in cash. So we've got money to deploy today. I don't think that
number needs to be very large. And in part, I look to the held for sale portfolio to drive that. That portfolio from
AmeriHome, the large preponderance in there as well has – those clear out in two to three weeks. And so that is a
near cash element that we can use. So I'm comfortable with kind of – with where we are. I think that number could
drop down a bit more to 1% to 2% with liquidity behind it from loans that have already been pledged for delivery to
the GSEs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Chris, I might also – we might also mention, we have an $8 billion credit line with the federal home loan bank that
is unused. We've got a multibillion dollar credit line with the Federal Reserve that is unused. We've got multibillion
dollar credit lines, credit funds lines with other institutions. They're not necessarily committed, but we think that
they're certainly there that are also unused. So we've got well over $10 billion that we could drop on as needed.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then if I could just sneak in a housekeeping. I think when you announced AmeriHome, you talked
about the tax rate maybe going up 100 basis points, so looking for a little guidance on there. And then the card
income was strong this quarter. I want to understand if that's a run rate. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, on the tax rate, I think – I am expecting that number to ebb up a little bit from where we are. That's in 19%, I
think it's – I could see it climbing closer to 20%. The card income, there has been kind of a difference in activity.
Ours is really [ph] a P-card (00:45:27). I don't know that I would expect that to extrapolate from there, but I think
business levels are getting better.

Operator: For the next question, we have Timur Braziler from Wells Fargo. Timur, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just circling back on the expense side, I think you had said that the AmeriHome deal
added 1,000 employees to the organization. I know you mentioned that the efficiency ratio is likely to be
maintained in the mid-40s or at least in the near term. I'm just wondering, as that business is fully integrated and
run kind of the Western Alliance way, is there an opportunity to optimize that business at some point or are the
two different enough where you can't really touch the expense side of the AmeriHome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think, for the company overall, you need to think about the efficiency ratio being just about where it is, 44.5%,
45%. And that's where we're going to probably run the company. That will allow us to continue to invest in new
products and services, look to bring on new business teams. Maybe you look to develop organically new business
silos and also as we continue to grow at the pace that we're growing. So we're a $50 billion asset-based company
today. We need to also ensure that we put the right investment into the technology and onto the risk management
side of the business.
So when we think about our numbers, when we think about the guidance leaving this year at a $9 EPS run rate,
we don't have it moving off of 45%. That allows us to grow EPS earnings the way we think we need to grow and
also invest at the same time.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last one on AmeriHome originations, and you said the win rate now is 12%
to 13%, up from 7%. I think historically, previously you had mentioned that that number could go as high as 20%.
And it doesn't really sound like the non-QM component is really ramping up yet. So, as that ramps up, is that
going to go through the production and increase kind of the gain on sale volume? Is more of that going to be
portfolioed in the near term? And then kind of corollary to that, if you can just talk about where the resi yields that
were put on the book today are and where those can go once you start bringing down some of the non-QM
paper?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I mean, the primary goal of increasing or broadening what they're buying is to give the bank another
channel of growth in residential with, again, low LTV, better-yielding assets. So, AmeriHome, for the most part
now, has generated product that we like the business. But we'd like it going to the GSEs because the yields aren't
necessarily high enough for what we think the best kind of risk-adjusted returns would be. And so – but as they
add that in, we'll be able to pick up even more from AmeriHome to kind of put on our balance sheet. I think that
number is going to be around 3% what we can do kind of going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, this is what we get paid for. There is a lot of interconnectivity between AmeriHome and on the banking
side. If we have strong loan demand on the banking side, we will not hold on to as much on the residential
mortgage side, and AmeriHome will have a higher gain on sale. If there is any soft demand or more excess
liquidity than what we anticipated, we'll take loans from AmeriHome and we'll keep them on our balance sheet.
And the gain on sale will be less for AmeriHome, but you'll see a higher flowing net interest income for the bank.
And so that's what we balance out every day here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then so as you start bringing on more non-QM paper, I guess, how fast should we expect to see the
win rates start to elevate? I mean, they're going to stay at the 12%, 13% level for now and the mix shift is not
going to change or do you see the non-QM channel being additive to what's currently being produced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I'm hesitant to give you a forecast going forward what the win rate is because you've got to add a few other
factors in there. What's the margin? What's happening with – overall with the 10-year. But what I'll say is and what
we learned when we were doing the due diligence for AmeriHome is that they have the ability to expand the win
rate in order to keep the gain on sale income high enough to achieve what we want to achieve in terms of our
EPS guidance. And so that's going to be balanced between margin and between the win rate. And as we said, it
was – they're at 12%. They've been as high as about 17%. So we've got room there to move that around.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Ken, one of your quotes in the release is you began to unlock value from AmeriHome, I'm just curious what's
next. Is it the things you referenced like mining the warehouse in HOA or is there something else that's more near
term and right in front of us when you say you're just beginning to unlock value?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks, Jon. It's really everything I mentioned as a little bit of a prelude on the earnings call here. So we've
got a list of things that we're just going down and executing upon. Certainly, the easiest one was let's unlock the
value by paying down their outstanding credit lines done. As we're selling MSRs, let's see if we can give loan
commitments to the buyers which we've done this quarter. Let's see if we can hold on to deposits, which we've
done this quarter, but it's not a one and done thing of course, we're going to continue to work on that as we go
forward.
A little further down is the cross-sell into the warehouse lending lines, that's going to take a little bit longer, as you
can expect we were focused on legal day 1 and legal day 90. But the warehouse lending cross-sell will happen
towards the end of the year. We've got the AmeriHome folks working on the jumbo mortgage program. We have
been working on the non-QM program.
So – and those are just some of the things I can – I reference. So we've got a lot of things going on here. What
we're trying to do is find the value that we can unlock at AmeriHome which translates over into our net interest
income which just gives us greater value and in terms of valuation on the banking side. And that's how we've
always thought about the deal, Jon.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, actually the first place where we saw one of the bigger opportunities where we said, oh my god, we weren't
thinking about this, it was on the EBO side. That's the early buyout of loans from Ginnie Mae. You're able to buy
them at par and then turn around and sell them at very close to consumer direct margins spreads which is in that
500 basis point range.
The reason why AmeriHome was active, but not overly active was that they had a negative carry to that because
their cost of funds was probably all in around LIBOR 200 basis points. Well we took 10 basis point money and we
put it against a large purchase of EBO loans and now we're able to carry that the EBO loans in a positive carry
until we're ready to sell the loans down the road.
So I think that one really surprised us at how quickly that opportunity appeared and frankly it wasn't really
discussed much during the due diligence period, we were doing more of the normal blocking and tackling
conversations during due diligence.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Two more questions here. I understand why you're breaking out the profitability now, but is this something
you plan to do or you want to do in the future. Is breaking out the profitability or do we expect this to eventually be
very much integrated in the consumer piece of the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, good question. For this year, we're going to continue to kind of give you the guidance of the $1.41 because
it's a new business line, but we don't breakout any of the other business lines. As I said...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
...this is a – 17% of our total net income. So as we start giving you the – you can see we're doing it now. We're
giving you the guidance that we're existing the year at $9, that's the number we're focused on for the whole
company exiting at $9. This year we're talking to a little bit more about the $1.41 because we want to make sure
the comfort level is there that you know that we're executing upon that acquisition, upon that trade, if you will. But
longer term, we're just going to talk about our total EPS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, the mortgage, it's integrated, the more murky and difficult it is to try to distill it all. I mean if we're cross-
selling into their warehouse clients now and then we're getting direct sales to our mortgage portfolio holdings.
What does AmeriHome get allocated for that? We're not into that game. We're more interested in moving the
whole ball rather than trying to see who gets how many pieces in each side of the play.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. It's interesting because you hit on a hotspot here for us as we were thinking about this not too long ago. If
we take more mortgages from AmeriHome and we keep it on the balance sheet, of course, we've just lowered
AmeriHome's gain on sale. So this is the murkiness that Dale talks about. Is that good or bad? Well, I kind of think
it's kind of good that we're keeping it on our balance sheet. We're getting that net interest income and it's going to
stay out there for an extended period of time. Others could say well, gee, I would have liked that game to happen
immediately because I want that immediate recognition. So we try to balance this stuff. And that's why we think
it's much better to look at the overall total EPS number than it is just to look at a segment of the EPS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. That's good. I was going to ask that but I thought it was too deep for this call but – just in terms of the
allocations. But just one more for you Dale, not everyone that hold your stock as a mortgage expert and this is
probably annoying and a simple question. But how would you think about the main inputs into that that gain on
loan origination and sale line that $132 million, just big picture what should we be thinking about when we model
that line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so, I mean AmeriHome has been a large producer in this space. I think that that their activity level can
continue at what they've been running. That's their core business. We think that's certainly an opportunity. We
think they can expand that as we've talked about in terms of some of these other business lines. We think there is
maybe a cross-sell into our HOA business and things like this.
But again that's going to get kind of overwhelmed by the benefit we get. So, I mean AmeriHome's numbers, they
had $15 million of net interest income in the quarter from mostly hoping their held for sale loans. The other $38
million was core Western Alliance on net interest income, and that was in part because of the liquidity
deployment. So I am looking for AmeriHome to continue to deliver as they have and but again these cross-sells I
think are really where the key is in terms of driving higher EPS.

Okay. Thanks for everything. I think Suns in 7, you have to win at home, but it has to be a little dramatic. So, that's
my call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, we have like 3,000 Suns championship T-shirts on order. So, we're already heavily vested into that. If not
we'll be selling them very cheaply to anyone who wants some.

Operator: For the next question, we have Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Gary, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. [ph] Get away from (00:58:40) mortgage for a second, just want kind of ask about the
credit-linked notes for a moment, obviously as part of that transaction you freed up a good amount of risk-based
capital and some extra capacity for lending. I just wonder if you would draw a direct line to that capacity as it
relates to the cross-sell opportunities into AMH's warehouse clients are increasing the warehouse business or
would you think of it more holistically is this creating additional capacity for wherever those higher risk weighted
assets come from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah I think it's more holistic in terms of what that is. I mean again we're focused on generating strong risk
adjusted returns. The warehouse space is one that not just us, but I think the industry's experience from a credit
perspective has been very strong. The credit-linked note does strengthen the – does strengthen the credit quality
of the bank and provides more insulation to it. We have somebody who's now on a first loss position, not us, if
there is any losses within that portfolio.
So we do get a relief on the – on like you mentioned the risk weighted assets. I think it's warranted because
somebody else away from us an investor has first loss for anything that happens there. So in that sense, we're a
stronger credit profile. But what we look at is, gosh now RWA is lower, we can continue to grow.
From a shareholder perspective, it's much cheaper to do the credit-linked note than it is to issue shares on the
ATM, that's obviously a substitute alternative to get there. And it reinforces the value of that business line because
we can have a direct method to support the capital needs from there that is significantly less expensive than the
returns that we get from our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thank you. And then just to ask about the $9 run rate that you've talked about the last couple of quarters exiting
this year. Can you give us a sense of what that contemplates from a provision line item because obviously in a
given quarter, that could have some volatility to it? So just any thoughts on what that contemplates or if you
wanted to kind of equate that $9 run rate to a PPNR per share kind of run rate, as any additional detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well it includes a normalized provision, it does not include releases or underfunding or – nor does it include the
reverse of another kind of global challenge like we had in 2020. So – but what it does look like in terms of basis
points, I don't have a number for you, but I think if you look at the composition of our loan growth and where it
comes from, what would it take to support that kind of going forward, we don't perceive of substantial credit losses
coming at any time in the future, but we'd cover charge-offs. So we'd cover charge-offs, and we'd cover growth in
22

a relatively low risk growth profile as we're putting on the books in 2021 and I think we're going to be looking at in
2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I would echo that, I mean I'd look backwards and look what our last year's charge-offs were and maybe use
that as a guide as what the provision would be. But to be very clear, we don't anticipate large releases to generate
that $9 EPS run rate. That's not included in our logic.

Operator: For the next question, we have David Chiaverini from Wedbush Security (sic) [Wedbush Securities].
David your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi thanks. I had a follow-up on deposits, you mentioned about how the mortgage warehouse deposits were up
very strongly at $1.7 billion. I was curious is there any seasonality in the mortgage warehouse deposits that could
be a headwind as we look out to the third quarter and fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
There is some seasonality. I'm going to say fourth quarter and maybe primarily driven by California, California
taxes, property taxes are due. And so as you know, those warehouse deposits are overwhelmingly funds held
from escrow funds from servicers so – which people escrow their insurance payments and they escrow their tax
payments. But as you get one particular state that is skews heavily for their overall. I think they are due in
November. I'm not a California resident. So you're going to see a dip whereby the servicer is writing a check
drawn on us to the state or to the relevant counties they are coming in. So yeah, there is a piece with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then shifting to the resi mortgage portfolio that you're keeping, just want to clarify that what
you are keeping historically and continues to be jumbo and non-QM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, it does. I mean so again, the trade that we're making is we're willing to give up liquidity for yield and strong
asset quality. So, we're going to compromise in any Q, but if we can get – if we can give up some liquidity to get a
better return, we'll do that. So what I mean by that is say you have a non-qualified mortgage something that isn't
23

salable to the GSEs. It's going to trade at a lower price a higher yield. Something that is jumbo is going to trade at
a lower price higher yield. So we have – these are about 65% loan to value loans.
Debt to income is in the mid-30s. The FICO scores are 760, so we think it's pretty good quality stuff. But because
it's not saleable, it trades at a lower price, and we're like, oh gosh, we can how handle that, we want to put it on
our balance sheet kind of going forward. Just because it's not liquid to the GSEs, it doesn't mean it's not liquid to
us. So for example, all of these loans we can pledge on our federal home loan bank line, and they give us
advances on them. And it wouldn't be difficult at all even if you wanted to securitize these loans and sell them to
private investors.
