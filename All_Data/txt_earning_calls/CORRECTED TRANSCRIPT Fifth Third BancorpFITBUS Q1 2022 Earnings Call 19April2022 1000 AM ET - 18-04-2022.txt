Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our
financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can
be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP
measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking
statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking
statements after the date of this call.
This morning, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; President Tim Spence; CFO Jamie
Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg, Tim and Jamie, we will
open the call up for questions.
Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $494
million or $0.68 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.02 impact from the Visa total return swap
and the mark-to-market impact of our AvidXchange Holdings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter
earnings were $0.70 per share.
During the quarter, we generated strong loan growth, including average C&I growth of 8%, excluding PPP. We
grew core deposits once again, with strength in consumer transaction deposits of 4%, reflecting our success
generating quality household growth, which increased 3% on a year-over-year basis.
We also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash and grew our securities
portfolio by approximately $5 billion on an average basis. As a result of our interest earning asset growth, net
interest income increased 1% sequentially, excluding PPP.
We had yet another quarter of benign credit quality, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and
underwriting. This resulted in near record low charge-offs of just 12 basis points. In addition to our muted credit
losses, NPAs remained stable, and our commercial criticized assets continued to improve.
As many of you saw last week, I announced my plan to retire as CEO and transition to Executive Chairman,
effective July 5. As part of our thorough succession planning process, I'm excited and proud to announce the

board has unanimously appointed Tim Spence to succeed me as our next CEO. I believe this is the right time for
a transition, given Fifth Third's tremendous financial health and performance.
Shareholders who have followed Fifth Third for a while know that when I became CEO, I made a commitment that
we would generate strong financial results and perform well through the various business cycles, when we
formalized our plans with the Project NorthStar. We articulated several key strategic priorities to generate strong
and sustainable long-term financial results, including optimizing our balance sheet, differentiating our customer
experience, growing and diversifying our fee revenues, building on our legacy of digital innovation and
maintaining expense discipline.
I am very proud of what we achieved. We transformed our approach to credit risk management, centralizing credit
underwriting with geographic, sector, product level concentration limits, we exited commercial relationships that
had a skewed risk return profile totaling $7 billion, focusing on high-quality relationships with a more diversified
and resilient businesses. We deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure, down more than 6% since
2015. We remain cautious with respect to our CRE portfolio with the lowest CRE as a percentage of capital
among peers. We maintained our expense discipline, taking actions when necessary, including exiting non-core
businesses, which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance.
We invested heavily in our treasury management systems, shifting our focus to building managed service
platforms. As a result, we now have the highest TM fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments and we
are the fastest growing among our peers. We made significant investments in technology to improve our
resiliency and better serve our customers. We built a consumer business that has consistently added households
far in excess of our peers and the US average while also taking our customers' satisfaction scores from below
peer medium in 2015 to top quartile today.
We grew market share organically in the Southeast and West Coast and established a leading position in Chicago
through the strategic acquisition of MB Financial. We also invested in strategic non-bank acquisitions like Provide,
Dividend, Coker Capital, H2C, Franklin Street and more to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities. We
structured our securities portfolio to generate stable predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend our
earnings advantage versus peers, and we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders, including
customers, employees and communities.
From day one, my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle while generating
consistent and quality earnings quarter after quarter, year after year. While some of these decisions impacted
near-term profitability at the time, all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past seven
years to improve Fifth Third and set us up for a long term outperformance through various business cycles.
Furthermore, we expect our intentionally asset-sensitive balance sheet to perform extremely well relative to peers
in this rate environment.
While the revenue benefits of higher rates are obvious, we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risks in
the overall US economy if the Fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to curb inflation, combined with the
existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages. However, because of our actions and positioning, Fifth
Third is as strong as ever and well positioned for long-term outperformance.
I would just like to say that being the CEO of Fifth Third has been an honor of a lifetime. I am grateful for the
support of the Board and all of our employees, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. Fifth Third is
in great shape, and Tim is well prepared to lead Fifth Third into the future. Tim is an outstanding and visionary

leader. He's been an integral part of Fifth Third's leadership team since 2015, helping develop strategies and
vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology.
Before I hand it over to Tim, this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call, I can honestly say I have enjoyed
almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the analyst and investor
community. I want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me throughout my tenure. I also want
to thank our entire leadership team. I have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team,
which I believe is the best in the industry. What we have accomplished together has been nothing short of
remarkable. Thank you. I know that under Tim's leadership, you will continue to do great things, inspire others and
improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities.
With that, let me turn it over to Tim.

Timothy N. Spence
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning to you all. Thank you, Greg, for the kind words. I'm honored to serve as Fifth Third's next CEO and
to follow in the footsteps of an incredible leader like you. I could not be more excited about Fifth Third's future.
Given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance, you should expect
continuity in our strategic focus areas and in how we run the bank. We will maintain our operational focus,
expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the
future.
We will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats, consistent
with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years, including our deliberate multi-year reduction
in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic; the rollout of our award-winning Momentum Banking
product suite, which is unparalleled among peers; our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management
services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic; partnerships and
acquisitions of fintech platforms like Provide and Dividend Finance that create national scale and a best-in-class
customer experience; and our focus on financing renewable energy well before ESG became a mainstream term.
More broadly, we will remain mindful of the long-term structural shifts taking place, such as the evolving
geopolitical environment, population aging, government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create
winners and losers over the next decade. No one knows for sure what the world will look like 10 years from now,
but as prudent risk managers, we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks as well as positioning the
bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise.
We will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders. To
that end, yesterday, we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to $20 an hour across our footprint
and that concurrently, we will provide a mid-year wage increase to employees in our first four job bands. We are
taking these actions despite having best-in-class employee retention according to leading research because we
recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our front-line employees
who are the face of Fifth Third. In total, more than 40% of our workforce will benefit from these increases,
including 95% of our retail branch and operations employees. It is simply the right thing to do.
In the short term, this will result in roughly $18 million in incremental annualized expenses. However, as we have
seen with our two previous wage increases, we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower
turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
As Greg mentioned, our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong. From a capital deployment
perspective, we will continue to favor organic growth, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities such as Provide
and Dividend Finance, paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases. Practically speaking, given our
robust loan growth, we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022.
On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to say thank you to our employees. I'm very proud that in
addition to producing solid financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives
of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that I do
in being part of an organization that was just named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere,
one of just five banks globally. Fifth Third is a great company because we have great people who live our core
values every day.
With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook.

James C. Leonard
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were solid despite the market
volatility during the quarter. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories,
deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits. Expenses were once again
well-controlled, but fees underperformed our January expectations due to the market environment.
Improvements in credit quality resulted in an ACL ratio of 180 basis points compared to 185 basis points last
quarter, while an increase in loan balances resulted in a net $11 million increase to our credit reserves. Combined
with another quarter of muted net charge-offs, we had a $45 million total provision for credit losses.
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion was stable sequentially.
Reported results were impacted by lower day count, lower PPP income, including a slowdown in forgiveness that
resulted in $10 million less in expected PPP-related NII and the expected decline in residential mortgage
balances from previous Ginnie Mae purchases. These detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment
of excess liquidity into securities, strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates. Excluding PPP, NII
increased 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Total reported non-interest income decreased 9% compared to the year ago quarter or 7% on an adjusted basis.
Similar to peers, our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue, primarily due to transaction delays
as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, partially offset
by improving MSR asset decay.
We generated solid year-over-year fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management,
where we produced net AUM inflows again this quarter. Consumer deposit fees were stable as our success
generating household growth offset the continued decline in punitive consumer fees as part of our Momentum
Banking offering.
Non-interest expenses increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting continued discipline
throughout the company. Compensation expenses were well-controlled, with the year-over-year increase
reflecting the previously announced broad-based restricted equity awards, which will support the continuation of
our strong employee retention.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
We also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms. These items were partially offset
by lower card and processing expense due to 2021's contract renegotiations. Adjusted expenses increased 2%
sequentially, driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits
expense. Our expenses this quarter included a mark-to-market benefit associated with non-qualified deferred
compensation plans of $12 million with a corresponding offset in securities losses.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Average total
consumer portfolio loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations, combined
with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan
balances, primarily from GreenSky balance runoff.
Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting
growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 6%, with C&I loans up 8%. Commercial
loan production remained strong and in line with our original expectations. Production was strongest in core
middle market, which was well diversified geographically, which increased over 60% year-over-year. Our
production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic
expansion as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter.
With muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital markets slowdown, period-end
commercial loans, excluding PPP, increased 5% sequentially, and 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Over
half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with the utilization rate increasing 2% to
35.5%. Given the market opportunities in the first quarter, we began deploying excess cash to protect against the
rising risk of an economic downturn. During the first quarter, we grew our securities portfolio approximately $13
billion. On an average basis, securities increased $5 billion or 13% sequentially.
As we have said over the past two years, our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow
the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention. The past
90 days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait and our actions this quarter and beyond will
ensure our strong through-the-cycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term.
Our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable
cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increased from 59% to 64% at
quarter end. Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash, decreased $6
billion, reflecting the growth in loans and securities, partially offset by continued core deposit growth. Compared to
the year-ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction
deposits increased 11%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We once again added
households in every market compared to last year, led by our key Southeast markets.
Moving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong, with NPAs at 47
basis points and net charge-offs at 12 basis points. We continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and
higher rates may cause stress. As Greg also mentioned, we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored
leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason, which is now below $3 billion in outstandings, while also significantly
improving the quality of the portfolio.
Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending
our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.7%. We maintained our scenario weights of 60% to
the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Our ACL build this quarter reflected strong loan growth
and a worsening downside economic scenario, partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan
7

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
portfolio, including a reduction in borrowers in prolonged distress. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside
scenario, the ACL would be $1.1 billion higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the
reserve would be $236 million lower.
While our base case expectations point to continued economic growth, there are several key risks factored into
our downside scenario, including escalating geopolitical tensions, which could exacerbate existing inflationary
pressures and further strain supply chains, pressures from the Fed's quantitative tightening or additional COVID
variants, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best
estimate of the economic environment.
Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, above our stated target of 9%. The decline in capital
was primarily due to strong RWA growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities
purchases, combined with an 8 basis point impact from the CECL capital transition rule. We expect to close the
acquisition of Dividend Finance in the second quarter, which will deploy approximately 30 basis points of capital.
Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 1% during the quarter and 5% compared to the
year ago quarter.
Moving to our current outlook, which includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance. We expect full year
average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021, including the expected headwinds from PPP
and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan
growth of around 10%, reflecting strong pipelines, sales force additions, the Dividend and Provide acquisitions
and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. This should result in commercial
loan growth of 9% to 10%, or 15% to 16%, excluding PPP.
We now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our first quarter decision to lower
auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital. We now expect around $8 billion in auto and
specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth in indirect consumer secured
balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of
Dividend Finance, partially offset by a 20% decline in GreenSky loans.
On a sequential basis, we expect second quarter average total loan growth of 2% to 3% comprised of 3% to 4%
commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances. We expect 5% to 6% average C&I growth in the
second quarter, excluding PPP. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately $10 billion
in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with
the assumption that we add $2 billion more in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through
early April. We also assume $1 billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter.
Given our outlook for earning asset growth, combined with the implied forward curve as of April 1, we now expect
full year NII to increase approximately 13% to 14%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts
from the runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which result in a $220 million headwind this year. Excluding
those portfolios, NII growth would exceed 18%.
Our current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in 2022, compared to 2021 with
continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the mid-single digits, offset by the expected runoff of non-
operational commercial deposits. We expect deposit betas of around 15% on the first 125 basis points of Fed rate
hikes, the 25 basis points we saw in March, combined with another 50 basis points in both May and June.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
While we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base, the rapid and aggressive policy response by the Fed
to curb inflation, including the potential for 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to March 2023 and aggressive Fed
balance sheet reductions, we expect deposit betas of approximately 25% over the first 200 basis points this cycle
compared to the mid-30s last cycle. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the
timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities
growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas.
For the second quarter, we expect NII to be up 11% to 13% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact
of securities purchases and the benefits of our asset-sensitive balance sheet. We expect adjusted non-interest
income to be stable to down 1% in 2022, compared to our prior expectations of up 3% to 5%. This change is
primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook. The single biggest line contributing to the change is deposit
service charges, which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment.
The rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue, which we now expect to be down 10%
or so in 2022 compared to 2021.
We continue to expect strong but slightly lower than January expectations in commercial banking fees and private
equity income in 2022, provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur. It is
worth noting that even with the decline in expected fee income, primarily due to the interest rate environment, we
expect total revenue to now be approximately $275 million more than our January guidance.
We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter or down
around 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be stable on a
standalone basis or up 1% to 2%, including the impact of Dividend Finance compared to 2021, which is an
improvement from our previous guidance of up 2% to 3%.
We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both
technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we add 25 new branches, primarily in our high-
growth Southeast markets. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that Tim
mentioned.
We expect these investments in our people, platforms, and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our
process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in
leasing expense given our disposition of LaSalle business solutions, which was completed in April, and our
continued overall expense discipline throughout the company.
We expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around 3% to 4% compared to the first
quarter, which is up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend
Finance or stable on a standalone basis. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected
to significantly exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in nearly 3.5 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio.
Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent
acquisitions, expense discipline, and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue
headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2022 net
charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis points range.
In summary, we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment.
We are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued through-the-cycle
outperformance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful 2022.

Yes. Jamie, appreciate all the thoughts on sort of liquidity deployment. I guess now that you've deployed sort of a
majority of the target, roughly $10 billion or so in excess liquidity and the rest will be deployed through the
remainder of the year, is there, in your mind, sort of an opportunity to kind of redefine what your excess liquidity
looks like? In other words, deposits aren't really coming out of the system at large the way one might have

thought earlier. Is there a point at which you say, hey, those are going to stick around and they're sort of a use or
will they just be absorbed with loan growth, etcetera? Just maybe any thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's a good question, and thanks for asking, Scott. I probably should have included it in my prepared remarks that
I've recalibrated our excess liquidity given the first quarter's activity to where we're sitting on about $15 billion of
excess cash here in April. I still like the one-third, one-third, one-third approach where perhaps a-third of it runs off
in the commercial deposit book as the Fed starts to move in 50 basis point increments, and then a-third in
additional security purchases, so $5 billion more during the course of this year, and then, obviously, the rest in
loan growth, especially with dividend coming on board where we expect continued nice loan growth throughout
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then you gave some thoughts on sort of the puts and takes in the expense outlook. I guess it
was nice to see that you can absorb that minimum wage increase and still improve the expense guidance. Are
there any areas where you guys explicitly dialed back things outside of compensation increase? Or, I guess, sort
of maybe just a little more thought on the puts and takes as you see them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. The puts and takes this quarter relative to the January guide really is the interplay of the rate environment
between fees and NII, whereas expenses – the main driver of the improved expense base on a standalone basis
is really the fulfillment costs and related compensation related to the lower fees, but the rest of the franchise and
our approach to managing expenses during the year really hasn't changed from when we started the year. We
continue to focus on technology investments and supporting our marketing efforts, and so the marketing spend is
actually a little bit higher as we look out at the year, given the strong growth we've had in consumer household
acquisitions and the Momentum Banking product. Obviously, the minimum wage adjustment was a little bit of an
uptick in expenses, but again, offset by some of the savings from the lower fee guide.
So, overall, I think the approach remains the same, which is, continue to invest in the business and continue to let
that strong momentum show up in the rest of the balance sheet activities.

wondering, sort of, why you decided now would be a good time to step aside. And, Tim, maybe just as a follow-up
to that, what are you most excited about as you look forward outside of macro in terms of the growth prospects for

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Erika, this is Greg. Thanks for the question. First off, I think it's really a perfect time for me to be stepping down as
CEO. The bank is in fantastic shape. I became CEO in 2015. The objectives we put in place to be good through
the cycle, make the changes that we need to for outperformance through the cycle, I feel really good about. So
position of the bank, our position for the future, the success we've had, it's a great time to step aside. Second
thing is Tim's readiness. Tim's been with the bank six-plus years. It's been a succession, I think, a well thought out
succession plan. Tim is absolutely ready. The time is now for him to step up, given the performance of the bank.
And the third thing is my personal aspiration to retire at age 60, which I turned 60 in January. And that's always
been an aspiration of mine to be able to do that. And there's a lot of things I want to focus on, a lot less travel on
the personal side, personal investments, and 60 was kind of my timeline also. But that would not have worked if
Tim wasn't ready, the bank wasn't positioned as well as it was, so it really came together to be the right time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And Erika, as it pertains to your question for me, I mean, I'm excited about a lot. I think we are in as good a
shape as Fifth Third has been at any point since I have been around the company, including the several years
that I spent outside the bank as a consultant to the bank and to Greg, and I think we have assembled a really
outstanding bench of leadership talent, right? We talk a lot about experience being a team sport here, so you
have deeply experienced folks from inside the company, you have folks who have joined from outside the bank
who brought in fresh perspectives and have really helped us to think about how we shape the business going
forward.
And if you think about the long-term objective we set for ourselves, which is to outperform through the cycle, I
think all the pieces parts are in place. We have a great culture of expense discipline, we've inculcated a credit
discipline that will support through the cycle performance. We have been investing continuously. I think
sometimes maybe we haven't gotten enough credit for it because we have essentially been harvesting expenses
in some areas and redeploying them in growth, and the byproduct of that is we have a really excellent footprint
and a nice balance between the Southeast and the Midwest.
And we're seeing the bloom coming from many of the investments we've made in digital capabilities, I think, in
particular, with the focus on product innovation, right? Whether that is Momentum Banking and the differentiation
that, that has provided and supported, has provided to our household growth goals, or the managed services,
which, as Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks, it helped to really drive the right balance in fees to total
revenue. And then I think last, but certainly not least, the benefits we're going to continue to see from the
acquisitions of Provide and Dividend in terms of providing sustainable loan growth with really attractive ROAs. So
there's a lot to feel good about here.

Got it. And the second question is for Jamie. Jamie, AFS has become a bad word this quarter. And I'm wondering,
you've always had a very distinct investment policy. If you could explain to the generalists that are listening to this
call, that have been distressed about the CET1 erosion that they've seen at the big banks where it's been
relevant, and then the AOCI at other regional banks, kind of the impact to tangible book, what you bought in the
quarter to $10 billion and the difference between duration risk for CMBS and RMBS. And also, if you could
translate into generalist language what bullet and locked out structures mean.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think I could take the next hour of this call if I go through those, but just tells you how good a question it is. Jump
in if I don't touch on all aspects of it. But I guess I would start with saying – and maybe I'm fighting a losing battle
on this one, but I do struggle with the concept of fair valuing one line item of the balance sheet, but not the rest of
it, or not evaluating HTM in combination with AFS, because philosophically, for me, as a Category 4 bank, our
election to put a security into AFS or HTM doesn't change the economics or the risk of the investment.
And I understand for the largest banks, there is value in minimizing the risk of the regulatory capital volatility. But
for us, well below $700 billion in assets, we believe the benefits of maintaining the flexibility to manage the
portfolio as the environment unfolds or our outlook changes creates significant value. And you've seen that over
the last eight years where we've had the number one performing investment portfolio yield in the industry.
So I struggle with the concept of would our company be worth more, if I place the securities into the roach motel
of HTM or if I maintained my flexibility and my optionality and put it in AFS. But I understand that's how the
valuations work. Our goal is always to optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and
not make decisions that optimize an accounting outcome over economic value. So that's why we continue to put
all of the securities in AFS because we like the optionality.
In terms of what we're buying, the second part of your question, we do like the bullet and locked out cash flow
structure so that there's a minimal extension risk in that security relative to RMBS. Probably the best example for
the generalist on that would be, our duration was 4.8 years at the end of the year and it moved to 5.4 years at the
end of this quarter. All of that duration extension was because of the securities that we purchased. We averaged
2.5% yield in 6.5-year duration on what we purchased.
So all of our duration extension was intentional, and we prefer to add duration when we want to add it as opposed
to the market forcing that duration extension upon us. And that's really the value of the bullet and locked out cash
flow, sacrifice a little bit of yield in a base environment, but I protect the volatility on uprates or down rates, and
that's really the philosophy of managing the investment portfolio.

Is that how we should think about this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I looked at it, Mike as I add $30 million to $35 million of excess cash. I bought $13 million of additional
leverage in the quarter. We got about $15 million left net of loan growth for second quarter purchases and
additional cash deployment as the year progresses. And I think to Scott's question early on, there's an opportunity
that perhaps that other $5 billion of runoff in deposits doesn't occur is offset by growth in other areas. But for now,
that's how we see the year playing out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then to the other question for the CEO change, Greg, you gave a summary of what you've accomplished over
the last seven, eight years, anything that you – say, if you had more time you'd like to have achieved. And then,
Tim, more like who is Tim Spence, right? What is your background? Maybe, Greg, why did the board select Tim?
What are the unique characteristics for Tim to be the steward of Fifth Third's shareholders capital for the next
several years forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Absolutely, Mike. First off, we accomplished the objectives that I set out for – that we talked about and we put
Project NorthStar in place. Would I like to have done it more faster? Yes, probably. But once again, the ability of
the organization to absorb the amount of change that we're bringing forth was important also. So I think we did it
the right way. It's not a whole lot I would have changed or done differently. So I'm very proud of what we've
accomplished. As Jamie said and Tim said, it's a team sport, and we've got a great organization. We've worked
harder for the greater organization and a great team around Tim.
Why Tim right now? Absolutely the right person. Tim has a strong technology background. He's been instrumental
in a lot of acquisitions and the investments that we've made in the space. He has great, great abilities to look
ahead, understand and assess the challenges that we're going to be faced with, not one year, two years, but five
years down the road. So when you think about what the bank needs going forward, strong technology expertise,
but also being a visionary and being able to see down the road what the challenges might be that we're faced
with. And also execution, Tim is fantastic on the execution side. You give me the greatest visionary, the greatest
strategist, but if you can't execute, you're not going to be successful. Tim has demonstrated over the years,
especially as President, he can execute extremely, extremely well.
Once again, if that wasn't the case, we wouldn't be making this transition at this time. But he is absolutely ready.
He's the right person for the reasons I just said. I couldn't be more excited. I'm a large shareholder. I'm going to
be a large shareholder. To have Tim at the helm going forward – and I'm excited about starting the next phase of
my life, which is retirement, something I worked hard to achieve at an early age. And I think it's just a great, great
time for both of us.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Couple of questions. First, on the C&I, I noticed in the deck that ex-PPP, you were up 8% Q-Q. And I just
wanted to see if you could unpack the drivers a little bit. One of the reasons is inventory builds going up, how
much longer can that last? I've got a colleague internally who is telling me that inventories are about peaking and
I'm wondering if you agree with that or not, and maybe give some sense of what you're seeing in your customers'
desire for CapEx and what the runway is on that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Sure, Betsy. This is Tim. Thanks for the question. So, look, you have to think about our C&I business as
being the corporate banking business and the middle market business. So I think very clearly, the corporate
banking side of the business, the rising utilization there is at least in part a byproduct of the capital markets having
been in flux. And ideally we anticipate that as the markets open up and the folks that we bank who are issuers on
a regular basis go back into them that you'll see more fee income and then in turn a little bit less utilization. But
there is no question of inventory build there.
In the core middle market, I think there is still room to run on inventory build, but there is no question that the
catalyst for us in terms of our own growth has been now the focus on CapEx, in particular, investments that are
going to drive labor productivity, or at a minimum, a reduction in labor requirements. And then in addition to that,
we have benefited now and are continuing to benefit from what was a record pace of adding new quality
relationships last year, which has carried over into the first quarter,
Jamie and Greg and I were laughing before the call, it's really it's the four Cs for us, it's Cincinnati, Chicago, the
Carolinas and California, plus Tennessee, and we couldn't figure out how to get a C out of that one. But that drove
the outperformance in C&I production in the first quarter.

Yeah. There you go. Tenne-C. Exactly. There it goes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then maybe you could help me understand how you're thinking about deposits and deposit movement from
here. You've got the Fed QE, but then you've got your high-quality book. And so, how should we be thinking
about deposit growth and what the loan-to-deposit ratio should look like as we progress over the next year or so?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. We certainly expect the loan-to-deposit ratio to what I'll say, improve, get higher. We finished the quarter at
69%. And really, the interaction between the loan-to-deposit ratio and the deposit betas is obviously highly
correlated and as we entered the last tightening cycle at Fifth Third, we were in the mid-90s. So we don't expect
to get that high in this – over the next couple of years. But we certainly would like to manage the company in the
80s from a loan-to-deposit ratio, but it will take a little bit of time to get there.
I think from a deposit activity standpoint, we expect continued strong consumer deposit growth. And then, we're
forecasting, and perhaps it's conservative, a runoff in the non-operational deposits within the commercial book is
– we're just not going to chase rate-sensitive, non-relationship deposit balances. But with that said, I really like the
balance sheet that we've put together over the last seven years where we've really improved the primacy within
the consumer book as well as the granularity through the household growth, along with the improvements in the
operational deposits through our strong treasury management business. I know we've talked about at different
conferences over the course of the year, the strength of our TM business, but that ultimately will pay off as rates
start to rise and we can perhaps manage to a lower beta in the next 200 basis points than what we saw with the
start of the 2015 hikes.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey thanks. Good morning. Jamie, just following up on the securities portfolio purchases, now that you've both
moved more in and also rates have moved higher, I wonder if you could just level set us relative to your
comments last quarter about where you think the securities book yields go over the course of the year, looks like
you're in the mid-2.80-ish just type of now. Can you just give us kind of an updated level set on how that trajects
given the better front book yields that you've been able to see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So we expect the investment yields to be in the 2.75% area in the second quarter as well as for the full
year, which is up obviously from the guide we had in January in the 2.60% to 2.70% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Perfect. Great. And then second, just a question on deepening on the expense side. So the expense guide got a
little better for the full year even with the incremental minimum wage. Could you just kind of give us some
granularity on what was the rest of the delta? Was it incentive comp related to fees? Was it just incremental
efficiencies that you've been able to find? Just details there would be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's predominantly the fulfillment costs within mortgage and incentives in the other businesses that were impacted
by the lower fee outlook, and then partially offset by the higher marketing expenses and the minimum wage
increase impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

open
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I guess, one question just around – as we think about capital deployment, future M&A, just
talk to us around how – and maybe Tim, if you want to jump in, on how you think about adding scale? So you're
obviously organically growing in the Southeast, talk to us about like bank M&A, is there any appetite for that? And
then how does that fit in when you think about technology? And I know Tim you spent a lot of time on payment
tech strategy, so some perspective on how you see Fifth Third's position on the tech stack? And what are the one
or two big sort of areas that you're looking to invest as we think about the next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Okay. A lot of questions. This is Greg. Let me get started here. First off, when we think about deploying capital,
we have not changed how we think about it. Number one is organic growth. That's extremely important to us,
whether the expansion in the Southeast, on the West Coast, investing in our people, technology, products,
services. Job one is organic growth, building a quality franchise for the future to perform well.
Second, we look at non-bank M&A transactions. So opportunities like Provide, Dividend Finance, H2C, Coker,
Franklin, will be examples of non-bank opportunities that really add to our products and our service capabilities.
That's extremely in our reach, extremely important to us. We're always looking for those type of opportunities that
make us a better bank and that's number two. Number three, we want, obviously, we want to continue to pay a
strong dividend. Number four, with excess cash will be share repurchases.
Lower in our priorities would be M&A. Now, why is M&A, bank M&A, lower in the priority list for us? Quite frankly,
there's not a lot of opportunities out there. And we don't believe M&A is a strategy unto itself. We think M&A is a
strategy which will support our strategic direction. When you look at some of the transactions that have been done
recently, we would not participate – did not participate in those type of transactions. So once again, if there was
an opportunity from a bank M&A perspective, they have to fit into our strategic objectives, such as being larger
and more relevant in the Southeast and attractive markets. There's just not a lot of those opportunities that exist
today, that's why it's lower in our priority list.
It doesn't mean that when something did emerge that fits into our strategic direction, makes us more relevant in
the Southeast and the right markets that we're looking for, is a good cultural fit, that we wouldn't consider it. We'll
absolutely consider it. It's just lower on our priority list because there's not a lot of those opportunities out there
that really fit what we're strategically trying to accomplish and we think are actionable. So that's why it's lower in
the list for us. But, once again, if something emerged, we will obviously assess that for long-term shareholder
value, we will consider it.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Yeah. And for what it's worth, I concur with all that. I think we've said for a long time that we don't believe that
scale is an end in and of itself. And that certainly will be consistent in terms of our point of view on how we
proceed. As it pertains to your questions about technology, you can think about the investments that we have
been making in basically three areas. One is just the core infrastructure, right? We've talked a lot about data
centers. We've talked a lot about the cloud data strategy. We talked a lot about information security and
otherwise. I think we feel very good about where we're at on that front.
We are making good progress. I can't remember the cricket analogy, so I'm going to have to go with middle
innings, but we're taking the platform modernization front. Okay. And I think feel very good about the migration
away from legacy mainframe platforms and on the platforms that allow us to spend a lot more of our money on
new application development as opposed to maintenance and service.
And then I think the thing that's probably been less – that has been underemphasized in our industry in general,
but which is a big point of focus for ours, is we are believers that the more fundamental disruption associated with
the Internet in all sectors is the way that it informs product and product innovation. So that is the area where I
think we will continue to look to differentiate. We have to be good at all of the other items that are hygiene factors,
but it's the opportunities to leverage technology to change the nature of the value proposition that we have for our
customers, the way that we did with Momentum Banking when we launched it a year ago, and as we continue to
hone and refine and add feature functionality to that platform, the things that the folks at Provide have done over
time that they actually been able to accelerate the amount of innovation that they brought to market. We launched
five or six new products within the first six months that they were onboard and they had gotten two or three out in
the prior few years beforehand. And then the managed services, which are obviously a critical platform for us and
which provide really stable and high-margin fee income.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Good morning. Can you guys talk about how C&I spreads are trending? I know a few quarters ago, you were
talking about pressure, but we've seen obviously widening spreads in capital markets, which isn't a perfect
indicator, but certainly better to widen than narrow. And on the flip side, as rates go up, there's obviously more
spread to potential play with as you think about competitive forces. So maybe what you're seeing now and how
you think they'll trend in the next few quarters? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Matt, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. The C&I spreads are definitely stabilized during the course of the
first quarter, such that the C&I yields ex-PPP were only down 4 basis points as opposed to some of the double-
digit types of declines you saw in other quarters. So we feel good about stabilization of loan yields. And in fact, for
the balance sheet, hitting an inflection point in the second quarter for pretty much every asset class that yields
and spreads should be improving as we go forward from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Then as we think about, I guess, specifically like on the spreads, like yields would go up obviously because
rates are going up. But then a lot of banks are – or all banks are trying to grow kind of the core C&I, which has
been a strength of Fifth Third for years. So how do you think some of the spreads trend in the next few quarters
between the puts and takes of – again, capital markets you've seen some spread widening, but competitive forces
from the banks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think C&I spreads in the second quarter, stable, flat and then improvement perhaps as we get to the back
end of the second quarter heading into the second half of the year, given some of the disruption in the capital
markets and the spread widening from the geopolitical tensions. That's how we have it modeled going forward.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Greg and Tim, congratulations on the new roles for both of you. Jamie, I always appreciate your color
commentary about the balance sheet and the asset liability sensitivity as well as the expectations you have for the
full year as well as the second quarter. And the world has changed dramatically in this first quarter as evidenced
by your assumptions on the Fed funds rate and the powerful impact that has had on net interest income. Can you
share with us, if we're here a year from now – now, granted Greg will be drinking a piña colada in the Caribbean,
we know that. But for you and I – what should we really focus in on a year from now that could be as startling? It's
just breathtaking how it's changed. And it's not just for you folks, of course, it's to everybody. But I'm just taken
aback at how strong everyone's net interest income growth is now because of the rate environment change. And
I'm wondering, a year from now, what could it be like that could make us stay up late at night worrying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think a year from now, and really, the value that we see from our actions this quarter is just how well
positioned our balance sheet is to perform well through the cycle, both from an NII perspective and a credit
perspective. And I think perhaps there was some concern, would we have waited too long and missed the
opportunity? And I think the good news from today's release is that we are well positioned and well protected to
the possibility of a recession in 2023 or 2024. Not that that's our base case, but certainly something that we're
mindful of, and we pride ourselves, and really under Greg's leadership over the last seven years, of being good
risk managers, and that's how we approach things, so that should a downturn occur, we're well positioned to be a
strong performer. But should we continue to see good economic growth that this is a company that's positioned to
do well with generating high returns, high PPNR growth, and really do well through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Gerard, if I were to add one thing, I think Jamie referenced credit. We've come out of a period here where the
dynamic around rates has, I think, really obscured the importance of funding quality. And just given the way that
reporting gets done, it's probably hard to tell from the outside looking in how good the funding base is. And that
doesn't just extend to banks. It's to non-banks as well, right?
So as the Fed tightens, I think there's going to be more differentiation than maybe the market fully appreciates as
it relates to the stability and the quality of your funding base. And the banks who have done the things that we've
tried to do in terms of growing primary relationships and with a focus on core operational deposits should be much
better positioned to weather an environment where liquidity maybe is, there's a premium attached to it, unlike the
environment that we really have come out of over the course of the past handful of years.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you for the color. And the prime relationships that you've developed with your customers and
the low-cost funding that comes along with that is obviously very beneficial. At what point – or is there a point that
you folks may look for some term funding if rates were to really go higher 12 months from now, just like they've
done in these last three or four months, does it make sense at some point to start looking at some term funding?

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the deposit beta topic, I just wanted to see if you could perhaps discuss any of the risks or
concerns that investors have that betas for the industry could surprise higher than many of the banks are
expecting. I know you guys are expecting a lower beta perhaps in the 25% range versus you experienced in the
previous cycle. Can you just talk about the concerns there that competition could be much more intense this time
around given the various players in the space that could perhaps influence deposit betas to be higher than
expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. John, thanks for the question. There are a lot of competing factors on where the betas shake out. We think
the overwhelming factor for the industry is the amount of liquidity is signified by the loan-to-deposit ratio and the
industry being 20% better than they were at the end of 2015, heading into the last cycle. But you're certainly right,
the level of competition ultimately dictates the deposit betas. We just think the industry is so much better
positioned now that the level of that competition should be less.
So from an industry perspective, we think that should win out. But then, if we're wrong, then let's talk about it on
an idiosyncratic basis for Fifth Third, what we have been able to accomplish with the primacy and operational
deposits, and the treasury management business has translated for us what we believe should be a lower beta on
the first 200 at the 35% last time, 25% this time. But with that said, 90 days ago, we were modeling a 20% beta on
those first 200. So we have raised our own expectations a bit. Hopefully, we will do better than that. But on the
possibility that we would not, a 25% beta is what we've settled in, in our outlook in the up 200.
When you break it down by customer segment, obviously, the wealth and asset management area is a highly
price-sensitive portfolio. Whereas, for us, the improvement won't be as much in that portfolio as it is in the
commercial business because of the treasury management. And then in the retail book, the value exchange with
the free services that you receive in Momentum Banking, we believe should result in a little bit lower beta this time
around, so that we're not competing on rate for the retail customer, but rather the value exchange with those other
services, including things like less punitive fees, the NSF elimination and all of the other structural changes we
made to our product lineup should result in a better beta this cycle. But if by chance we're wrong, I think we're
well-positioned to be able to compete well regardless of how that plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks Jamie. That's helpful. And then a similar question actually on the credit side, I know you're
not flagging anything too concerning on the credit front, and that's very similar to the message that we've gotten
out of the banks this earnings season. And – but I know you saw a bit of a tick up in your 30 to 89 days past dues,
and a couple of other banks have seen it as well. What areas of credit are you watching most closely? What
22


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
areas do you think will move first? And are there any signs of faster than expected normalization at all within your
consumer portfolio, for example?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, it's Richard. Let me start with the last one. From a consumer standpoint, we're actually not seeing
signs of acceleration. If you think about where the excess liquidity went certainly to the top – 70% of that went to
the top 20% of income households. That liquidity has been sticking around for our customer base. And again,
we're prime and super prime. And activity really has – we really haven't seen a shift in activity with respect to
behavior changes in terms of excess liquidity running off faster than we expected. In fact, it's running off a little
slower than we expected as people continue to strike the right balance across their lifestyles.
From a delinquency standpoint, we're at such a low level, and the delinquency change for us was really in
commercial. We're at such a low level, but it just takes one or two to slip over the quarter to change the
percentages. So we're really not seeing any trends in terms of that would be alarming. That points us to an
acceleration of the normalization across credit, whether it's consumer or commercial. I think areas we're watching,
clearly, we continue to watch the leverage space, particularly enterprise value lending. That's an area that we've
been very disciplined on, and we're happy with the portfolio, but that's a place where we continue to exercise
discipline.
There's a handful of segments in CRE, office is one that we're watching long-term, just given the structural
changes in that space. But we focus on quality, Class A properties, gateway cities. It's all very good stuff. And
then there's – then we're watching consumer products and manufacturing and senior living and a couple more
places where – that we're watching is places where the ability to pass through cost increase may be a little
harder. We haven't seen evidence of that, at least at this point most people have been able to pass cost increases
through, but that's where we're watching.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor (sic) [Terry] McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I'll take that. Good morning. Jamie, maybe a question for you, could you just remind us what the mix is within
commercial banking revenue? It was down 21% but better than some of the others who maybe, call it, capital
markets or investment banking? And then maybe what are pipelines like today? And do you have any near-term
thoughts on that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. The disruption in the first quarter definitely impacted the debt capital markets groups with the loan
syndications and the corporate bond fees. For us, within the commercial banking, it's a pretty good split between
FRM products where we're helping customers with hedging, call that a third of the business, a little bit more than
23


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
that amount in investment banking revenue, and then the remainder within some of the lending fee categories that
then aggregate to the total.
So, what we've seen is that FRM has done better than we originally expected, but that investment banking
category within corporate bond and loan syndication and bridge fees performed worse than expectations. So,
that's the mix there. The guide for the year includes some assumption that markets stabilize and reopen. And
should that not happen, then we would just have more of the interplay between NII and fees so that at the end of
the day, we still feel good about the revenue generation of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just as a follow-up, the average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% versus 7% to 8% in January, is
that all layering in Dividend Finance? Or ex that deal, you see a stronger yield within commercial lending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So, Dividend Finance will show up in other consumer loans, unlike Provide that did show up in C&I. So
you'll see Provide's benefit is in the C&I guide and Dividend Finance is in the other consumer loans category.

line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, I wanted to ask about the Fed balance sheet and if it contracts. Does that make a
difference to your rate outlook and/or kind of how you perceive the back row picture?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
We do expect contraction with our outlook of the Fed balance sheet as they potentially begin to sell down in June,
announce it in May. I guess, ultimately, the variable to our outlook would be, if they were to move significantly
faster than perhaps you have a little bit more deposit outflow or higher deposit betas than what's expected, but it
24

would have to be pretty quick and significant action on their part to implement the quantitative tightening more so
than what we've got baked in. So, I think ultimately, it will play out, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. But you're not expecting the opposite where they don't contract at all, that's not part of the equation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Correct. Yes.

Operator: Your next question again comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, since Greg, you defined Tim, starting with the word tech or technology, maybe just dig into a little bit
more, Tim, your vision, or what does the bank of the future look like in terms of technology? Greg, you certainly
have taken Fifth Third away, but there's still a lot more to go, I'm sure. So, I'll give you column A or column B.
Column A would be more on-premise proprietary in-house, don't rely too much on third parties and you can
control your destiny. And that column A is where certain banks are where they want to protect a lot of their
customer data and information, safety and security.
Column B would be zero ops, 100% public cloud, maybe 10, 15, 20 fintech partners in the type of LEGO
approach where you piece those together really making use of having kind of break down the borders around the
bank. So column A or column B? Or maybe I'm framing this wrong and you can give another answer, but how do
you foresee the tech bank of the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Tim is going to answer door C here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
No. Look, Mike, I think it's a mix of both. The nice thing about our sector is there really is a very active technology
vendor community, and it gives you a lot of choices about how you want to run the business.
I don't think we're ever going to be all in bucket A or bucket B. We're big believers that where there is an industry
utility that drives very limited customer differentiation and where there's a benefit to shared scale, it makes sense
to ride on the rails that are available, and where there's an opportunity to differentiate and/or an aspect of the
business that's deeply proprietary, that it's got to be managed and maintained in-house.
25


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
So I think you're going to see us take a best of blend approach as it relates to those two areas, but with a heavy
focus on owning the tech platforms and the products which are customer-facing and probably comparatively a
lighter emphasis on that as it relates to the back office, where you're talking about a scaled utility that's processing
credits and debits as opposed to something that's more strategic or proprietary to the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That was clear. But any more concrete metrics that you can give us. Not everyone discloses this, but the
number of apps that you have and how much you'd like to reduce that, or the number of vendors you have and
where you'd like that to go, or the percent that you're in the public cloud and where you'd like to take that, or the
number of data centers where the end state is what you desire? Just anything concrete, those of us on the
outside could maybe ask you again in a couple of years to track your progress.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Mike, this is Greg. I don't have concrete numbers for you. But when you think about things like data centers,
it's two. Obviously, we want to be down to two data centers, and we're approaching that pretty quickly here.
Obviously, we want to make sure we have a hot sight and you get latency on how fast things can travel to us,
because we have to be mindful of that. But that's going to be the case.
When you think about our core apps to run the business, something less than we have today. I'm not sure how
substantial it will be at the end of the day, but something less than we have today. Customer-facing apps, as you
think about that, where we can build off of common platforms and expand off common platforms, very different
than the past, use an open source, cloud-based computing, that technology enables us to do things a little bit
differently, we have less applications. So less applications on the customer facing side of the house, somewhat
less applications on the back end as we consolidate some of our platforms and vendors, and definitely less
vendors. And in data centers, we're going to two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, the metric that I think I'm really – the metrics where I'm really chiefly focused on have to do with
resiliency of our environment. We have talked a lot about that. And then they have to do with the mix of spend
and the sort of continued focus on driving a heavier share of our overall spend to new application development
and products and out of legacy maintenance costs, right?
Those, I think, are the things coupled then with what you can see publicly in terms of the way that customers
evaluate our digital channels in terms of the differentiation that you can see in the quality, in the products and the
services are going to be the things that you should hold us accountable to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Last one. So, run the bank, change the bank, spend for technology, where has it been, where is it today and
where might that go to then?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Just had a follow-up, and I apologize if you guys addressed this in your opening remarks. But Tim,
you mentioned the four Cs of your markets plus Tennessee, can you share with us where you're seeing the best
commercial loan growth within the portfolio? Are they coming from – what parts of the four Cs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. As in which industry sectors, Gerard, or where geographically within the markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
More geographic, Tim. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Sure. So Betsy, did correct me, it is the five Cs, if you count the SEE at the end of Tennessee as one. And I
got an angry text message from our Head of Indiana who pointed out that they had a pretty good quarter as well.
So, yeah, look, I think geographically, we have the benefit of having a really strong presence in midsized metro
areas. And if you look at both demographics and economic activity, that's where the majority of growth is coming
from across the US right now. It isn't necessarily the mega cities, and it's certainly not the rural areas, it's the
Charlottes, the Raleighs, the Cincinnatis, the Indianapolises, the Columbuses, the Inland Empire in California is a
point of example there as well, where you're seeing a lot of the activity, and that is very consistent with what you
would see inside our book of business as well.
So the Cincinnati-Columbus corridor, I think, has been a very strong and resilient corridor that should be even
better as Intel lands here and we get the downstream component suppliers and logistics companies and software
engineering companies and otherwise that make their way into the space. Indianapolis and Columbus, I think, are
the two bright stars in terms of economic growth in the Midwest. And obviously, what we are getting out of the
upstate and Charlotte and Raleigh has been really outstanding, along with Middle Tennessee and Nashville as
opposed to other parts of the state that are growing at a less robust pace.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And as a follow-up, Tim, in the commercial lending areas, how important are the treasury management products
to complement the actual loan growth. Obviously, we know lending standards can easily drive loan growth if you
lower them, but can you share with us that color as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No, I mean, they're extremely important, and they have been a big catalyst for the success we've had in
growing our quality relationship count, Gerard. So a third, 30% to 35% of our new relationships have been led by
TM in terms of the initial product sale, which certainly is anomalous to what I had experienced prior to our having
had the success that we've had as it relates to managed services.
And if you look at the available industry research, the folks that do benchmarking on this front, Fifth Third is
always in the very top of the top quartile in terms of TM penetration in the middle market and to our middle market
lending relationships, which I think you can kind of evaluate just by looking at the growth of commercial deposit
fees over time and commercial deposits as a percentage of commercial, total loan commitments, both of which
Fifth Third is best-in-class relative to its investor peer group. So, it's important strategically in terms of how we go
to market and the results are bearing out in terms of the financial performance.
