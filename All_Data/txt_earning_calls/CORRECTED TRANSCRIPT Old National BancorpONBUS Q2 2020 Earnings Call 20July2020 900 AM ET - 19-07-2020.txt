Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning. I hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy. We are
pleased with our second quarter results and the ongoing implementation of The ONB Way strategic initiatives
including our recent announcement regarding our technology partnership with Infosys. We have begun our
transition to a return to the workplace including reopening our lobbies and bringing our team members back to the

office. But admittedly, we are slowing down our transition as the number of positive cases are increasing across
our footprint. Our lobbies remain open, and we are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team
members, clients, and communities. I would also like to thank our team members for their hard work and
dedication to serving our clients and communities in this challenging environment.
Starting with slide 3, our second quarter net income was $51.7 million, including $3.7 million in after-tax ONB Way
charges. Adjusted net income was higher at $55.1 million which includes $22.5 million in provision for expected
credit losses and $2.1 million in provision for unfunded commitments. These provisions are consistent with the
most recent Moody's economic forecast. Brendon will fill you in on all the details.
End of period total loans increased by $1.3 billion, primarily due to PPP loan funding and commercial real estate
growth. Our commercial production excluding PPP loan production was $658 million slightly higher than the first
quarter. Line utilization dropped to 26% due to line payoffs and an increase in new unused lines of credit.
Corer deposit growth of $1.9 billion funded by PPP proceeds and higher savings rates were a bright spot. Net
interest income was higher from PPP income which offset the impact of lower interest rates. Mortgage and capital
markets revenue continue to be exceptionally strong and offset COVID-related lower deposit service charge and
interchange income.
We continue to achieve lower expenses as we execute on The ONB Way initiatives. Our adjusted efficiency ratio
for the quarter was under 54%. Year-over-year operating leverage improved by almost 600 basis points.
Our credit quality metrics improved during the quarter, but we expect that losses will ultimately materialize once
the stimulus and deferral programs run their course. We still don't completely appreciate the depth of the crisis,
but we believe our historically strong underwriting practices, diverse and greater loan portfolios, and Midwest
footprint should help us weather the impact better than most.
We continue to share with our Board of Directors multiple economic forecast and various stress tests. As a result,
we don't anticipate any other capital actions and we expect to maintain our current dividend. We're still open for
business and we're extending new credit. We manage for the long term. Our balance sheet and capital markets –
our balance sheet capital markets are strong. Our markets are diverse, and our experienced team will help us
manage through this challenging time. I'm confident that we will emerge even stronger on the other side.
Moving to slide 4, I want to update you on our recently announced technology partnership with Infosys. As a part
of The ONB Way, we hired outside experts to help us examine our current technology infrastructure, investments,
and talent. The technology investments required for financial services are only accelerating, and we recognize the
need for a strong partner to help us maximize the benefits from those increased investments. This multiyear
technology partnership will fund those accelerated investments in technology infrastructure, improve our training
and development opportunities, and increase our innovation.
We are confident that over time, this partnership will significantly enhance our client experiences and provide
even greater scale to grow our bank efficiently and effectively. Not only is Infosys a leading global information
technology company, they are also making a $245 million investment in the State of Indiana with plans to hire
3,000 workers, and they are building their US training center in Indianapolis.
I'll now turn the call over to Daryl.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2020
Daryl D. Moore
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Jim. I will begin my portion of this morning's presentation on the top half of slide 5 where we lay out for
you our exposure to what we believe to be the most vulnerable segments of our commercial portfolio. With regard
to the particular industries noted, you can see that none of the six identified vulnerable segments exceeds 2.3% of
total loans, and the total exposure of all of these identified segments are just 7% of total loans. We believe that a
critical factor in determining the staying power of our borrowers in this very challenging economic environment is
not only the level of capital each of these borrowers brought into this downturn, but also the ability to raise
additional capital, if needed.
In that regard, to the extent that they are forgiven PPP loans represent outside equity contributions to our
borrowers. And especially with respect to these vulnerable industries, we imagine that these capital injections are
going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the current crisis. If we're correct in our
assessment of the criticality of having access of outside capital sources, it's interesting to note that we approved
over $203 million in PPP loans to borrowers in these six vulnerable industry segments which represent just shy of
25% of the total pre-PPP loan outstandings of these industries.
We continue to work through the portfolio to rate our borrowers on their pre-COVID strength in areas of liquidity,
capital, the ability to service debt obligations and loan structure as a baseline for understanding to what extent the
current pandemic could impact those borrowers. As we began to receive interim financial results from our
borrowers, we will use that information to further inform our understanding of the underlying strengths or
weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions as appropriate.
With respect to the retail side of the loan portfolio, the chart at the bottom of slide 5 provide some information
around retail product exposures and a proxy of credit quality based upon average FICO scores. Delinquencies
and losses in these portfolios as a whole are performing better than they did through the first half of last year, but
we are very guarded in our view of those trends given the level of payment deferrals granted and the fact that we
have had a moratorium on most repossessions for four months.
Moving to slide 6, we provide more information on deferrals showing that we have booked deferrals on 14% of our
commercial book and roughly 3% on each of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios equating to an
11% deferral rate on the entire portfolio. First time deferral requests have slowed to a trickle, and we are just now
beginning to consider requests for the extensions of any first round 90-day deferrals. To the extent [audio gap]
(00:07:48) requesting deferral period extensions, we have had the – or we will have the opportunity to spend a bit
more time analyzing extension requests than we did on the front end and we'll use the baseline information on
liquidity, capital, debt serviceability, and loan structure that I mentioned earlier to ensure that we use this window
of opportunity to strengthen credits where we can in consideration of any further concessions.
Moving to the bottom half of slide 6. We're pleased to report that we have extended in excess of $1.5 billion in
Paycheck Protection Program loans to over 9,200 borrowers. As you can see from the chart, almost 80% of the
loans extended were to entities or individuals whose PPP loan size fell in $150,000 or less category, affirming our
position as a large bank with a community focus. There has been a team of individuals that have spent significant
hours in building up the forgiveness process for these loans which we will be ready to be utilized by our clients
once the SBA is open to receiving those requests.
On slide 7, we provide an overview of credit quality measures. 30-plus-day delinquencies at 17 basis points fell to
levels not seen for at least 20 years in this organization. As I mentioned earlier, it is critically important to keep in
mind that borrower assistance in the form of PPP loans, payment deferrals, and SBA loan payment supplements

have certainly helped to damper any increase in delinquencies we might have seen absent this assistance. It is
yet to be seen what impact any wind-down of these programs might have on delinquency rates going forward.
Net charge-offs in the quarter fell to more historically normal levels. Net charge-offs in the period were slightly
more than $0.5 million or 2 basis points of average loans. Nonperforming loans fell 12 basis points in the quarter,
in small part due to a slight decline in nonperforming balances, but mostly as a result of increased loan balances
associated with the Paycheck Protection Program.
In the final section of this slide 7, we look at the historical relationship of net charge-offs to nonperforming loans.
While on a somewhat increasing trend due to higher fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2020 losses, you can
see the significant difference between Old National and our peers when it comes to this particular metric.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Daryl. Before turning to the quarterly financials, we would like to provide an overview of our allowance
for credit losses. Our seasonal model assumptions were again derived from the Moody's baseline forecast, which
is now projecting high or prolonged unemployment and a sharper initial decline in GDP compared to our first
quarter assumption. It's updated economic outlook is the primary driver of the $22 million reserve increase this
quarter. Our current ACL to loan ratio including PPP loan stands at 94 basis points.
Excluding PPP loans, our allowance to loan ratio would be 105 basis points. I would also like to remind you that
we continue to carry $62 million in unamortized credit marks from our acquired portfolio in addition to the
allowance held on these loans. While these marks will not directly offset charge-offs, any remaining mark will
accrete through margin upon resolution. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs have been an effective mitigants
to credit losses in the near term. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path of the virus,
future government actions, and the long-term health of the economy. All of which could impact future reserve
needs. That said, our reserve levels reflect the current economic outlook and is our best estimate of the credit
losses in the portfolio today.
Turning to the quarter on slide 9. Our GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 and our adjusted earnings per share
was $0.33. Adjusted earnings per share excludes $4.9 million in ONB Way related charges.
Moving to slide 10, we are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue which was 7.6%
higher year-over-year and 19% higher over prior quarter. This improvement was driven by increased fee income
led by our mortgage and capital markets businesses, as well as the reduction in adjusted operating expenses
resulting from good execution of our ONB Way initiative. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we
improved operating leverage by 576 basis points year-over-year.
Slide 11 shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning assets mix. End of period loans increased $1.3 billion
quarter-over-quarter due to $1.5 billion in PPP loans. Commercial real estate loans grew at a 9% annualized rate
while C&I loans excluding PPP were down $201 million due to decreases in revolving line utilization. Commercial
activity continue to be strong with total production excluding PPP of $658 million and an end-of-period pipeline
totaling $2.7 billion. Loan yields excluding PPP were 3.96% for the quarter, reflecting the full impact of the decline
in short-term rates coupled with lower new business rates which average 3.09%. The investment portfolio yield
was down 8 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.63% with new purchases yielding 1.56%.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2020
Moving to slide 12. Both period-end and average deposits increased during the quarter as a significant amount of
PPP loan funds were deposited and remained on the book at quarter end. Deposits also benefited from a broad
increase in savings rates, as well as seasonal increases in public funds. Our total cost of deposits declined from
34 basis points in the first quarter to a low 17 basis points in Q2. While we continue to look for opportunities to
reduce funding costs, most of our planned rate actions are now complete. Time deposit cost fell 24 basis points to
1.1% and we expect this trend to continue for several quarters as the majority of our CD book re-prices within the
next 12 months. Overall, we are pleased with the results of our deposit pricing strategy as a result of a meaningful
reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base.
Next on slide 13, you will see the detailed changes in our second quarter net interest income and corresponding
margin. Net interest margin declined 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and was generally in line with our
expectations. PPP loans contributed approximately $7 million to net interest income but have a negative 5 basis
point impact on net interest margin. Excluding the impact of both PPP loans and accretion, net interest margin
was 3.07% compared to 3.16% in Q1.
The reduction in core earning asset yields which were down 22 basis points was only partially offset by a 13 basis
point reduction in funding costs. This trend in our margin will likely continue as our earning assets reprice in this
lower long-term rate environment.
Slide 14 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Our second quarter adjusted noninterest income was $58
million and represent a $6 million increase over prior quarter. The primary driver of this improvement came from
our mortgage business. Mortgage revenue was $17 million in Q2, which represents a $6 million increase over
prior quarter and a $10 million increase over Q2 2019. Mortgage production was a record $656 million with 34%
coming from the purchase category.
The pipeline also remains a strong $567 million heading into the third quarter. Please note we did take an
$800,000 impairment charge to our MSR portfolio in Q2 that is netted against our mortgage revenue. The capital
markets line of business remains a bright spot as interest rate swaps continue to be very attractive to clients. Our
wealth business benefited from seasonal tax prep fees this quarter. The lower equity market values did have a
modest negative impact on both investment and trust revenues.
As expected, bank fees were down $3 million compared to prior quarter, driven by a significant decrease in
overdraft [ph] percent-ness (00:15:30). Interchange income also came under pressure in Q2, but it's rebounded
nicely from its mid-quarter low point as spending patterns slowly return to normal with our local economies
reopened.
Next slide 15 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which reflects our ongoing focus on expense
management. ONB Way charges were $4.9 million this quarter, which is slightly better than the $6 million we
projected.
Adjusting for these ONB Way charges and tax credit amortization, noninterest expense was down $7 million
quarter-over-quarter. Our ONB Way expense initiatives have resulted in a 16% year-over-year reduction in
branches and 11% year-over-year reduction in FTEs. Also worth noting is that our second quarter noninterest
expenses included an increase in our allowance for unfunded commitments of $2.1 million. Our adjusted
efficiency ratio for the quarter was a low 53.8% and represents a 552 basis point improvement over Q1.
As I wrap up my discussion on the quarter, here are some key takeaways. We are pleased with our overall
performance that the fundamentals of our core business were strong. Commercial production was solid. Our fee

businesses continue to perform well, particularly our mortgage and capital market clients, and we delivered on the
promised expense savings we outlined in our ONB Way strategic plan.
Slide 16 include thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. We ended a quarter with a healthy $2.7 billion
commercial pipeline, but economic uncertainty may impact pull-through rates and mute loan growth in the near
term.
The impact on our net interest margin to the short end of the curve is now largely behind us, but historically low
long-term rates will continue to put pressure on asset yields, as our loan and investment portfolio is repriced at
lower coupons. Funding costs will move marginally lower, as borrowings and CDs reprice at maturity, but we do
not expect this will be sufficient to offset declines in asset yields.
PPP loans will also impact our margin going forward. These loans carry a 1% coupon and an average fee of
approximately 3% and will continue to be accretive through margin on a level yield over their two-year terms. As
loans are forgiven, any remaining fee will be accretive to income immediately. The timing of loan forgiveness is
still uncertain, but we don't expect significant payoffs to begin until late this year.
Several fee items will also likely come under pressure from the economic slowdown. Our wealth management and
investment businesses have seen a decline in the valuation of our assets under management that will impact
revenue in the near term. Overdraft fees were down sharply in the quarter and may take some time to recover to
pre-crisis levels. The mortgage market has proven more resilient than we expected, but will still be subject to the
typical seasonal declines in the back half of the year. We are slightly ahead of our planned 2020 ONB Way
expense initiative and have now realized a large portion of the savings promised this year. The Infosys
partnership is expected to generate approximately $5 million in onetime charges associated with upgrading our IT
infrastructure and will be recognized over the next several quarters.
We would also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook. We accreted an additional
30 basis points of CET1 capital, ending the quarter at a healthy 11.7%. I would also reiterate that based on
current capital levels and our outlook on earnings, we believe we will continue to outearn our dividend. We've also
recently updated our stress test model and under the CCAR severely adverse scenario, we remain well
capitalized at the lowest point in the nine-quarter horizon. Our liquidity position also remains very strong. With our
low loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%, strong cash and unencumbered security position, and various sources of
liquidity, we have plenty of flexibility to respond to future funding needs.
Lastly, we have provided some guidance on our full-year 2020 tax rate, which is expected to be approximately
20.5% on an FTE basis and 16% on a GAAP basis. As we previously reported, project delays caused by COVID-
19 have impacted the timing of our other historic tax credit projects that we anticipated will be completed this year.
Those projects have recently restarted, and barring additional delays, the projects could be placed in service by
year-end. If these projects are completed in Q4, we will take the full tax credit amortization and corresponding tax
benefit in that quarter.
With that, we're happy to answer any questions that you may have, and we do have the full team here including
Jim Sandgren.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A

What a shock. Good morning, Scott.

Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well and appreciate you taking the question. Just wanted to ask
one question on the reserve. I mean, the credit numbers are excellent, of course, and you guys have such a solid
history. But the only area where Old National looks light is just on the reserve-to-loan ratio. I feel like I know you
guys well enough to understand the nuance. But just any thought you might have had to perhaps, say, ramping
up the qualitative reserve just given the uncertainty in the outlook, or sort of what were the factors that got you to
this as the appropriate level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure. So, obviously, Scott, we build our models based on historical results, and we run the Moody's baseline
forecast through and trust that the models are accurate and appropriate given the economic outlook. I will say that
we also did add some additional qualitative reserve to the model this year, but we feel really, really comfortable
with where our reserve levels stand given the economic forecast that Moody's provided.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
And, Scott, it's hard to know exactly what the right answer is in this kind of environment. And we think we provided
an appropriate amount given our history of our portfolio and our granular – the granular nature of the portfolio, the
diverse nature of the portfolio. So, the board and management are very comfortable with where our reserve
stands today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. I appreciate that color. And then, Brendon, just maybe – I think since none of us has really gone
through a credit cycle with sort of credit marks the way they are, you got a $62 million credit mark. To what extent
is that indeed available to absorb loss? I think you touched on it in your prep remarks, but just any additional color
you could add would be great.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2020
Yeah. The accounting won't allow you to specifically offset a charge-off, but that – but those credit marks are on
the books and will increase through earnings and available to help fund provisions in the event we need it as we
go forward. And if a loan is resolved – if a loan is charged off, we will accrete that credit mark straight to earnings
in that period, although the geography will be different.

Good morning, Chris.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Brendon, if I could start with you on the PPP program. Just looking for a couple
of numbers and then a couple of outlook questions. I think you said in your prepared remarks 3% average fee.
What's the total fees that are yet to be realized aside from the 1%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, it's just shy of $44 million left to be accreted, taking about [ph] $3 million of that $47 million (00:23:06)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And the average balances of the PPP loans in the quarter, do you have that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
The average balances, I don't have that – oh, average for the balance for the entire portfolio, $1.1 billion. Sorry, I
thought [indiscernible] (00:23:19)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, if I think of the – roughly, I think you said $6 million in the quarter of total revenues from the PPP. Most
of that would be the 1%. What do you – I guess, how do we think about the cadence of that $44 million?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2020
Yeah. The $6.6 million that we took in the quarter was roughly split between fees and coupon. And we'd love to
get as much of this into 2020 as we can. We're – Jim Sandgren has a process to be proactive with the borrowers.
I think they're anxious to get this behind them as well. But until the SBA gives us a way to submit these we're all a
little uncertain. Obviously, there's been extension to the time to allocate eligible expenses, and so we're not sure.
But our best thought is that this is more a fourth quarter and beyond income event.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then last question on the PPP, the deposits that are associated with it. Can you just speak to the
trajectory of the stickiness of those deposits? Do we need to assume as the loans run into kind of one for one, or
how are you viewing those, the surge in deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris. This is Jim. It's hard to say, but I would assume certainly in the quarter that you'll start to see some
of those balances run down as they're being used for the reason they've been provided. So hard to say one to
one, but I would think we'd start seeing those balances reduce in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then my last one. I'll jump out. Brendon, you talked about the margin just for long and being just the
environment being not great for the group. If I take the core, core margin I think it was around 9 basis points of
compression. Do we assume a lesser degree of pressure because we've now felt the short end or is it – are you
messaging that we should see similar pressure in the back half of the year [ph] for quarter? (00:25:18)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. I think in the near term next several – next couple of quarters I think a similar trend downward is probably
appropriate but then we'll begin to flatten from there. But the longer this curve exits I think we'll continue to see
some pressure for some time going forward. And, Chris, maybe just one other point to your prior question. The
buildup in deposits associated with PPP which is roughly half of the $1.9 billion increase came from PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Maybe start with a question on slide 5. The vulnerable industries, as you guys describe them, changed from the
first quarter to the second quarter, a few kind of came out and a few new ones were put in like CRE, kind of senior
housing, could you just talk about over the last three months how you've looked at those loan portfolios and why
you made the decision to, say, remove transportation and add senior housing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Terry, this is Daryl. The transportation segment, we put that on because right out of the box, there seemed
to be a lot of talk about transportation. As we went back and looked at our portfolio, most of that transportation
exposure is in hauling either short-term hauling or low hauling within individual regions. So, we just didn't see
much deterioration there.
As we pull that out, we also looked at our senior housing portfolio which, up before the COVID crisis had shown
just a little bit of weakness. And so we thought if you think about that particular industry, it's difficult to bring new
clients into the assisted living just because of the COVID. And there's been lots of different protocols. They were
struggling with finding employees before the crisis. It's just difficult, increased costs associated with this industry.
So we thought, you know what, we just really need to be keeping our eyes on that. And so we thought it was more
appropriate to swap those two out just to give you a better picture of where our vulnerabilities might be going
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Terry, I tell you the entire leadership team goes through these portfolios credit by credit looking at the current
disposition, any potential future downgrades. And so we're spending a awful lot of time focusing on it and feel
good as we can today about those credits. But we do spend an awful lot of time making sure that we're managing
this portfolio appropriately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow up, maybe – I mean we're seeing weakness in service charges, interchange
revenue just across the industry. Any way you could put some numbers behind maybe when and how much it
bottomed out with the recovery through kind of the second quarter as it progressed, and what your thoughts are
now that there's been some kind of taking some steps back on the opening and some closures in some of your
core markets and what that could mean to this fee line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hey, Terry. This is Brendon. I can help you with the service charges. So overdraft really drove most of our service
charge decline, and we have not seen any meaningful rebound. It's been down and has basically remained down.
And that's approximately $2 million for that shortfall we felt in Q1 to Q2. Don't expect that to change.
As far as interchange income, it's probably a $0.25 million, $0.5 million worth of headwind in Q2. But that has
rebounded really back to fairly normal levels. So, I don't think that will be a concern going forward for us.

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think the service charges obviously are being impacted by the stimulus programs and the extended benefits.
And to the extent that those continue on into the future, you will probably still see that line item under pressure.
But to the extent that those start winding down, I think you'd probably see a return to normal.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Daryl, maybe a question for you on slide 6. You talked about the second round of deferral
discussions just starting to occur. Give us an idea of what you're thinking in terms of what this slide might look like
a quarter from now? I know you said that the activity has slowed pretty dramatically, but talk a little bit about what
you're seeing in terms of the flow coming in for a second round?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Jon, a great question. If you kind of recall our last call, we basically split about 50/50 on deferrals greater
than 90 days, and deferrals less than 90 days. We've got about half of the deferrals that are coming back in, and it
is a little slower than I had thought maybe on the front end, although I don't know that I would extend kind of that
thinking to the fact that maybe a lot of those 90 days don't ask for extensions. So it's yet to be seen there.
I think new extension or new deferral requests, if based upon the last 30 or 60 days, I just don't think we're going
to see significantly higher requests. So I don't know that you're going to see higher percentages of these portfolios
than what we have now, if that answers your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Jon, I would also add, as we've gone through these, we've seen many of these early requests were planning for
the worst case scenario, the worst case in terms of rent collection, whether it'd be commercial or individual rents,
and we are – if we go through these loans one by one, we're hearing pretty positive things about their ability. So
I'm hopeful that as we go through these renewals or as these mature that we'll go back to a normal cadence with
our borrowers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then another challenging question I guess as well, but Scott kind of alluded to it earlier. In terms of the
reserves and provision outlook, are you saying that your reserves today reflect some of the individual stresses
that you're seeing in the portfolio as well, or is it just more of using the Moody's overlay and making some modest
adjustments to that, so it's more of a macro approach? That makes sense, is it macro or loan by loan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, certainly, we're using the Moody's as the macroeconomic factor overlay, but we use all of our individual asset
quality ratings, LTVs, all the individual borrower characteristics which generally, the migration patterns have been
very strong even through this crisis. So, we are using granular loan portfolio data in our assumptions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, a chance the provision backs off a bit if a lot of those Moody's numbers, if we are in the ballpark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
If the Moody's scenario plays out, I don't think we'll see a meaningful reduction in the reserve but it should prove
up the reserve is adequate for the losses in our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then, I guess one more in a positive way, the pipeline hanging in there. Curious on the dynamics and the
drivers that we're all obviously focused on credit, but just curious on the new business pipeline as that one kind of
piqued my...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. Yeah, Jon. This is Jim. I'll take that one. Really encouraged by the size of the pipeline but maybe more
encouraged by the category. So the accepted category which traditionally, we get 90% to 95% of those loans
across the finish line. That stays stable quarter-over-quarter, where we did see some growth in the pipeline was in
the proposal stage.
So anecdotal feedback from our borrowers through our commercial RMs is that folks have a little bit more clarity.
They're optimistic for the second half of the year. Our pull through rates were down a little bit in certainly in the
second quarter, so we'll see if projects continue but people are talking about acquisitions, still talking about some
growth. So, we'll see. We're very encouraged about what could happen in the third quarter but we'll have to just
wait and see how things play out. But pretty well split between commercial real estate and C&I, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Jon, I also add. All three segment leaders have been really focused in on what can they do to help our clients and
what can we do to continue to grow each one of those businesses. So while the second quarter, early parts of the
second quarter, we're probably distracted with PPP production and things like that. We're really focusing in on

kind of coming back and working hard, making sure we're serving our clients and looking for opportunities to grow
each one of those segments.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. As it relates to the PPP, the duration of those loans, are you
amortizing the fees assuming you don't get forgiveness over two years or do you have some that are in the five-
year category?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We are amortizing these all over the two years.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then the, just the overall deposit trends, if I can get a little bit more color there.
Obviously, the PPP may be a little bit of a headwind. The public funds may be a little bit of a headwind here in the
third quarter. Can you grow deposits in the third quarter, maybe just talk about broader trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
I think the trends will be fairly stable with what you've seen in the past. So we just saw increased savings rate
across every category, every product type, business, personal and public in the quarter, and I think Jim alluded
these comments earlier as stimulus payments sort of draw down and PPP funds get kind of forgiven and
redeployed. We'll start to see that come down, and then we'll probably return back to normal deposit trend growth.
