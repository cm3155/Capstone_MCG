Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and your loved ones are well. We began the year
with a very strong quarter, achieving net income of $263 million. Before I discuss the highlights for the first
quarter, I am pleased to report that early this month, we announced a series of planned capital actions that we
intend to execute this year. These actions include a 12.5% increase in the company's quarterly common stock
dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to $350 million.
These actions evidenced the strength of our capital position, which allows us to return capital to our shareholders
while we continue to invest in our franchise and serve the needs of our customers.
Please turn to slide 3. Our quarterly net income of $263 million was $86 million higher than the fourth quarter.
These results were $228 million higher than the same quarter last year. Both quarters were impacted albeit in
opposite direction due to changes in economic forecast due to the pandemic and its impact [ph] under season
(02:37).
First quarter results were primarily driven by $82 million benefit in the provision for credit losses as well as higher
revenues. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher PPP related fees and increase in our
investment portfolio and lower deposit costs.
Our non-interest income increased due to higher mortgage banking income driven by higher MSR valuation.
Credit quality trends were positive in the quarter with lower NPLs, lower NPL inflows, and lower net charge-offs.
Our results reflect the ongoing rebound in economic activity experienced over the past few quarters in large part
due to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus, as well as our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk
management.
Please turn to slide 4 for an update on PPP and other operational matters. With respect to the PPP program, we
have funded 42,000 loans totaling $1.9 billion in both rounds. In round two, we have originated nearly 13,000
loans for $478 million. Of the loans originated in round one, close to $650 million or 46% have been forgiven as of
the end of the first quarter.
In Puerto Rico, as of March 31, we had funded 62% of all PP loans that have been originated on the island in both
programs. We have seen an acceleration in the adoption of digital channels. Active users on Mi Banco platform in
Puerto Rico have grown by 17% since March 2020. We captured 69% of deposits in the first quarter through
digital channels.
While slightly lower than the 71% observed in the fourth quarter, it was considerably higher than the 56%
registered in the first quarter of last year. We believe that these trends may adjust downward somewhat as the
economy continues to reopen, but we expect them to remain higher at pre-pandemic levels. Finally, our customer
base in Puerto Rico continues to grow, increasing by 12,000 in the first quarter to reach more than 1.9 million
unique customers.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macroeconomic environment in Puerto Rico. In the first quarter,
business trends and customer activity continue to improve, building upon the momentum seen in the second half
of 2020 as many of the restrictions that were in place were gradually loosened.
Vaccinations in Puerto Rico have progressed along a similar trajectory as in the mainland. While the number of
the cases on the island has increased in recent weeks, COVID-related hospitalizations remain below national
levels. Employment levels have improved but are still lower compared to last year. Total nonfarm employment has
increased by 2% since December 2020 but remains 4% below the March 2020 level.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
New auto sales have remained robust with sales of 32,000 units in the first quarter. This is the second highest
quarterly level only exceeded by the prior quarter's record level. Cement sales increased by 68% in the first
quarter as compared to the year-ago period which is the highest level since at least 2016.
The tourist and hospitality sector continued to improve. With much of the world travel limited, Puerto Rico has
become a popular destination for mainland residents during the pandemic. Airport traffic is improving at a rapid
pace. While [ph] USA (06:21) arrivals were down 20% from the year-ago period, arrivals during the month of
March were 40% higher than the previous year.
Hotel demand has also picked up significantly. The current hotel booking rate for the remainder of 2021 is above
the booking level at the same time in 2019, which was a record year for tourism in Puerto Rico.
Within Popular's clientele, credit and debit card sales in dollars increased by 39% compared to last year's first
quarter and has been higher than pre-pandemic levels. Auto loan originations at BPPR increased by 15%
compared to the year-ago period. Similarly, we have continued to see strength in the housing market.
While the dollar volume mortgage originations at BPPR decreased by 15% compared to last quarter, it has
increased 127% versus the first quarter of 2020. All in all, we are extremely pleased with our results for the first
quarter and encouraged by the economic outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financials.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix to the slide. Today's earnings press release details various things from the fourth quarter.
Net interest income for the first quarter was $479 million, an increase of $7 million from Q4, driven mainly by PPP
loan activity. Q1 net interest income increased by $9 million to $154 million. This was primarily driven by higher
mortgage banking income by $7.6 million due to a positive quarter-over-quarter variance in MSR valuation of $9.2
million, plus $3.5 million higher net earnings from portfolio investments held under the equity method. The
provision for the first quarter decreased by $103 million to a benefit of $82 million. Lidio will expand later.
Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter, down slightly from Q4. The fourth quarter included $23
million in expenses related to branch closure actions at Popular Bank as well as the reclassification out of the
expense category of $10 million for unfunded loan commitments which moved to the provision for credit losses.
Excluding these two items, the net increase in expenses in the first quarter would have been $12.8 million.
The adjusted variances for the fourth quarter included a $17 million increase in personnel cost due to higher
commission, incentives, and other employee compensation expenses that are tied to the financial performance of
the corporation, which were partially offset by lower professional fees by $4.1 million on lower advisory costs
which tend to ramp up as the year progresses and business promotion expenses that were down $3.9 million due
to lower seasonal advertising expenses.
For 2021, we continue to expect average quarterly expenses to be between $375 million and $380 million.
Continued outperformance as a result of improved credit and business sentiment could lead to higher expenses
later in the year especially in incentives, commissions and bonuses.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 20% in the fourth quarter. For 2021, we expect the
effective tax rate to be between 20% and 24%. This is higher than the range indicated last quarter as we now
anticipate generating a higher proportion of taxable income this year.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest income for the quarter was $479 million, an increase of $7.5 million from Q4.
NII on a taxable equivalent basis was $430 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. The primary drivers
of the increase in taxable equivalent NII were higher interest income from commercial loans by $9 million, mostly
driven by an increase in PPP interest income and fees of $11.6 million and lower deposit cost primarily at Popular
Bank. These items were partially offset by two fewer days in the quarter, which reduced NII by roughly $8 million.
Deposits grew by $1.9 billion in the quarter. This increase was mostly seen in BPPR's commercial and retail
segments. NIM improved by three basis points to 3.07% in Q1. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin
was 3.39%, an increase of 4 basis points. The higher margin is mostly due to higher PPP related fees and lower
deposit cost.
Total loan yields increased by 15 basis points in Q1 as a result of higher PPP related income of $23.1 million
compared to $11.5 million in the fourth quarter. Due to the accelerated recognition of fee income upon
forgiveness, these loans yielded approximately 7.21% in this quarter compared to 3.22% last quarter. The
remaining unamortized portion of PPP fees is approximately $50 million, of which 70% correspond to the second
round.
At this time, we believe that most of the first round PPP loans will be forgiven during the second and third quarter
of this year. and a majority of the second round PPP loans by the middle of next year. We expect margins to be
stable the rest of 2021. The ultimate result will depend on our asset mix, round two PPP originations, and the
speed at which these SBA guaranteed loans are forgiven.
As of the end of the first quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $15 billion, in line with last quarter.
These balances do not include the most recent CARES Act federal stimulus of $1,400 per person which were
received in early April. The government of Puerto Rico is quickly disbursing this benefit to residents in the island.
In the first half of the year, additional federal stimulus and tax revenues will increase public deposit balances
which depending on the amount and timing will be an important factor in the corporation's net interest margin. We
continue to expect early deposit balances to come down over time, driven by the restructuring of the public sector
debt and the eventual restart of current debt service.
Our ending loan balances decreased by $269 million in the quarter. The PPP portfolio accounted for $80 million of
the decrease. PPP loans issued in the first round dropped by $558 million, while second round disbursement
were $478 million. We continue to see strong demand and net portfolio growth in auto loans and leases, while all
of our auto loan portfolios are either flat or have decreased since the fourth quarter.
We expect loan balances will continue to be impacted by PPP forgiveness as well as limited demand resulting
from unprecedented levels of client liquidity. As such, we do not expect overall loan growth to materialize until
next year when demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace forgiveness of PPP loans.
Please turn to slide 8. Our capital levels remained strong relative to mainland peers and well-capitalized
regulatory requirements. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q1 was 17.2% or 90 basis points from Q4. As Ignacio
mentioned at the start of this call, our announced 2021 capital plan includes two actions. First, an increase of

Popular's quarterly common dividend of 12.5% or $0.05 to $0.45 per share. We expect our board to declare the
dividend in Q2 for payment in the third quarter.
Secondly, we will execute the common stock repurchase program of up to $350 million. While our recent buyback
programs have been executed via ASRs, the mechanism for the implementation of this buyback is still under
consideration. We will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital during the remainder of 2021 and
in future periods. However, we do not expect further dividend increases or common stock repurchases this year.
The filing and execution of our capital plan for 2021 was delayed by one quarter. We now plan to return to our
normal capital planning schedule, hopefully resulting in an announcement of Popular's 2022 capital action no later
than our January 2022 webcast.
Tangible book value decreased by $1.65 per share to $61.42. This decrease was driven by lower community with
realized gains in investments, partially offset by our quarterly net income. Our return on tangible equity was 21.4%
in the first quarter.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer Corporate Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. During the first quarter of the year, the corporation exhibited improved
credit quality metrics and lower credit cost, driven by the improving economic environment as a result of the
unprecedented amount of government stimulus in response to the pandemic. Notwithstanding our positive results,
given the uncertainty and the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, we continue to monitor the impact of
COVID on our entire loan portfolio. Please turn to slide number 9 to discuss credit metrics.
Non-performing assets decreased by $50 million to $774 million this quarter, mainly driven by an NPL decrease of
$40 million, coupled with OREO decrease of $11 million. The NPL decrease was mainly in Puerto Rico driven by
lower mortgage NPLs of $24 million, reflecting improved post-moratorium payment activity.
Construction NPLs decreased by $7 million, mostly due to a previously reserved loan that was partially charged-
off. At the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the
prior quarter. Please turn to slide number 10 to discuss NPL inflows.
Compared to the fourth quarter, NPL inflows excluding consumer loans decreased by $30 million driven by a
decrease of $36 million in Puerto Rico mainly due to lower mortgage NPL inflows by $32 million. In the US, NPL
inflows increased by $6 million mostly related to a construction loan that reached 90 days during its renewal
process but was current at the end of the quarter.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-off amounted to $21 million or annualized 29 basis points of average
loans held in portfolio compared to $42 million or 58 basis points in the prior quarter.
In Puerto Rico, net charge-off decreased by $22 million primarily driven by lower commercial by $19 million as the
prior quarter included impairment charge-off from previously reserved loans.
Consumer decreased by $13 million mainly due to recoveries of $8 million related to the sale during the quarter of
previously fully charge-off loans. The decreases were partially offset by higher construction net charge-off by $7

million related to the reserve loan that was partially charged off during the quarter. In the US, net charge-offs were
flat quarter-over-quarter.
The corporation's allowance for credit losses decreased by $96 million to $801 million driven mainly by the
improved economic outlook and improved credit quality as discussed further in the following slide.
The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased to 2.75% from 3.05% in the prior
quarter. Excluding payment protection program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans, this ratio is 3.10%. The
ratio of the allowance for credit losses to NPLs held in portfolio was 115% compared to 122% in the fourth quarter
of last year.
Please turn to slide number 12 to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses.
During the quarter, the allowance for credit losses decreased by $96 million when compared to the previous
quarter. Variances were driven by changes to the economic outlook, qualitative reserves, as well as portfolio
credit quality and mix. Our ACL framework utilizes probability weights of different scenarios to our estimation
process. We combine Moody's Analytics S1 baseline and S3 scenarios.
While a strong recovery is evident, we remain cautious of adverse outcomes given uncertainties around the
impact of new virus strains and the Puerto Rico government's ability to utilize the available federal assistance. As
a result, we'll continue to assign to the baseline scenario with the highest probability, followed by the more
pessimistic S3 scenario.
Our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with unemployment rate and GDP being the
largest drivers. The current baseline scenario shows improvement in both 2021 GDP growth and unemployment
rate when compared to the previous estimates. The forecasted GDP growth for 2021 is now 4.9% for the US and
3.4% for Puerto Rico while the forecasted unemployment rate average for 2021 is now 6.1% for the US and 8%
for Puerto Rico.
The change in the macroeconomic scenario caused ACL to decrease by $64 million. During the quarter, we
added $16 million in qualitative research related to our commercial real estate exposure in the US. Total portfolio
changes caused ACL to decrease by $26 million. Portfolio changes include fluctuations in credit quality and
volume mix.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the first quarter, aided by
payment deferrals and government stimulus. We will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to
pandemic-related risks and changes in the economic outlook.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. Our colleagues continue to achieve impressive results under very
challenging circumstances. Popular started off 2021 with positive momentum, driven by strong earnings,
improved credit quality, record deposit levels, continued customer growth and planned capital actions.
We are optimistic about the economic environment and our opportunities for the remainder of the year. In addition
to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to COVID, Puerto Rico still has a significant amount of
hurricane recovery funds that are yet to be disbursed and which we expect will now start flowing at a faster pace.

Their combined impact should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and
we are well positioned to benefit from such activity.
The pace of vaccination is also encouraging. As the data has demonstrated, massive vaccination is the key to
controlling the virus. I am proud of how we have been collaborating with local health authorities and community
organizations by lending our facilities and personnel to help accelerate vaccination efforts in Puerto Rico.
I am particularly happy to report that more than 80% of our employees in Puerto Rico have now received at least
one dose of the vaccine. We still have more work to do in our other markets, and we are committed to
encouraging and facilitating vaccination opportunities for all of our colleagues.
Our team is focused on supporting our customers and our communities through the transition to a post-COVID
reality. We're in a strong position to contribute to that recovery and leverage the opportunities that lie ahead. We
are now ready to answer your questions.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for the question. I guess starting off as the big picture on Puerto Rican GDP, I believe that baseline
number is looking for 3.4%. If you could just talk and kind of put that in context, when was the last time we saw a
number like that for Puerto Rico?

That's kind of what I figured. I guess, given your market share and continued momentum in growing customers,
could be gearing to this recovery be greater than what you project where you really don't sound like we should
expect material loan growth overpower the PPP runoff until next year. Could it be sooner than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I mean, hopefully, it will be sooner. Maybe we could see something at the end of year but it takes time for this
money to come to the economy. And when we expect the pace of the funds to flow, that is because I think the
government of Puerto Rico with the federal government have agreed on procedures for much of this money. But
that doesn't mean that doesn't take time to work out.
For example, most of these projects require some kind of a bidding process. And now you'll see the government
start the bidding process and whatnot. So, we believe it's going to take time for that money to flow. And again
there is such a large amount of liquidity in the system still that both consumers and businesses have a lot of
liquidity.
So while maybe we'll be surprised but we do have the runoff coming from PPP. We still have the Western portfolio
also running off a bit. So we're trying to be prudent in what we're projecting. But in general we do believe there will
be loan growth eventually, just hard to predict when we will start to see it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
It's more an issue of timing than whether it's coming, Brock. We feel that it is in the past in terms of the short term
the liquidity and the paying off the PPP probably outweighed what we [indiscernible] (27:10).

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Ignacio, could you share with us maybe an update on the Puerto Rican debt restructuring? I think there was a
proposal maybe made in the beginning of March of this year on the public debt, the $35 billion or so, and then
also the public pensions. And then in addition to that, any updates on what's going on with PREPA and the
restructuring of that debt?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Okay. The public debt is moving along. I mean, the – I was going to say the arbitration but it's really a mediation.
The mediation has been going forward. And it looks like they're getting pretty close to an agreement that a
significant amount of creditors could sign on to. I think that the fiscal board has put a goal of trying to get this done
in 2021, which would be optimistic. But that said, I think they've made significant progress.
The pension is very much tied into that deal because obviously the restructuring plan currently, at least the
rumors we've heard and the different elements of it will require some reduction in pensions albeit a small one. So I
think that's being negotiated now.
I think that's probably the most important sticking point in how do you resolve that and can the government, given
that its revenues have done better than expected and the economy doing better than expected, can the
government perhaps make some of that up in another way. So we'll see. I'm relatively optimistic that they're
getting close to a deal. I wouldn't predict it will happen this year because it's just so complicated. But they're
making progress.
On the PREPA restructuring, I don't know where that is right now. I think the most pressing issue right now is the
fiscal – I'm sorry, the court has deployed a motion to approve the payments to LUMA under the contract. They
had approved some initial payments for the transition phase, but LUMA is supposed to take over the distribution
and transmission starting June 1.
And those payments have to be approved in the bankruptcy proceeding and they are filing the motions from both
sides of the government and the board asking that those payments be approved, and one of the electrical workers
union opposing it. I hope that gives you some color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. No, very good. No, thank you. Now, can we now take it to the next step? Let's assume at some point it is
restructured, the public debt and they resolve the public pension issue as well. Can you guys walk us through how
you think the deposits that are now sitting in there – I think, Carlos, you said they are about $15 billion – how do
you see those working their way down once the approvals are all in place, they start debt service again? Have
you given that any thought?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, we do not know, Gerard, the exact execution plan for the restructuring. But of the things we have seen imply
that there would be an upfront one-time payment of something in the magnitude of $7 billion.
Now, a good chunk of that payment will probably be funded from the accounts the government has in Popular.
Not necessarily all, they have accounts in other banks as well, but it's a high probability that a good chunk of it will
come from us.

So if that were to happen, then we'll see other deposits go down by some amount, by $6 billion, $7 billion and
whatever that is. That outflow of deposits will not have a liquidity effect in Popular, because as you know, all
deposits need to be fully collateralized.
So, we get our collateral back and we said that we will replay whatever we want to do. So, it's not a liquidity event.
But, in this interest rate environment, it's also not a material net interest income event because a lot of those
funds are in cash or cash equivalents earning very little.
But it is a material event on our balance sheet because our balance sheet is a little outsized right now because of
the bank built this deposit. And when this deposit leaves, the balance sheet will start looking closer to a normal
course of business – balance sheet. Obviously, the departure of this significant amount of liquidity would also
have an effect on our NIM.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just finally on capital, as you know, the Federal Reserve came out and were going to go to
the stress capital buffer construct for our largest banks on the mainland here starting in the third quarter.
And as part of that construct, as we all know, there's not going to be the need for the preapproval of these banks
for their share repurchase plans and dividend increases. When you look at your relationships with the fed, and I
know you're not part of obviously the DFAS process that the big banks go through, do you think you will be
relieved of any preapproval process on your capital action plans going forward in 2022? Or do you think you'll still
need the preapprovals that you've gotten in the past, assuming you've had to have them in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes, I think what we've done with the Fed is we've established a good relationship and technically they don't
approve – they do not object, I think is the word I would – we've been careful to say I think in our releases. So, I
think we are going to continue that process. It's worked for us. We share with them our capital plan. We tell them
what we're thinking and generally they've become much better at responding much faster than in the past. So, I
think it's worked for us. I think we'll stick to that process.

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes. I guess just following up on the debt restructuring, beyond just the deposits going out, how do you expect
that to kind of flow through to the island in terms of either new business development or new business? And how
would that impact Popular?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I personally believe it's going to be a positive. I mean, a lot of good things can happen if we can get the
restructures. It's one more stripe off the tiger I guess. First of all, it will show the world that Puerto Rico has – is
moving forward. We had a lot of negative headlines in the past. I think we're going to start seeing more positive
headlines. That will be one.
Obviously, it'll be easier for Puerto Rico to predict its future and build out its budget priorities now with how much
you can count. So, I think it's just a big positive psychological, but it's also a big positive from a planning and
priority – strategic priorities and political consent. We'll now know how much money we can count on. So, I think
it's going to be a big positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then with the loan growth or I guess loans expected to be kind of flat this year, what is the balance of
your current PPP loans? And excluding the PPP, would you have at least modest growth expected for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
The balance is about $670 million I think in the first – the PPP1 and $478 million in PPP2. And so, whether we
see some growth ex that will depend on when they get forgiven, right. Because if it evolves on the second phase,
wait until the beginning of next year, then what's going to be leaving the rest of this year is somewhat $600 million
change. But a lot of PPP – remember the second phase of PPP was designed to have a lot smaller loans and that
is what it has in it.
And the smaller loans actually can take advantage of this more simplified forgiveness process. So it's not
impossible that we might see the forgiveness or the second phase accelerate. As I mentioned at this point in time,
we think it's going to be the first half next year. But if the clients get their things on roll, it could be earlier. So it will
depend on this whole chunk of $500 million that we don't know exactly what the time it's going to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
And we are seeing strong – as we've mentioned several times, strong growth in areas like auto loans. So
definitely that's a portfolio that's growing. I think we can expect more momentum in the mainland. Also, I think
South Florida is basically back to normal. And we believe that New York will come back faster than most people
expect. So those are areas that we're looking at also closely.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Good morning Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First off, just a couple of questions around some modeling stuff. As I look at NII, Carlos, maybe you can talk about
some of the levers that you have or that you've been doing to see NII actually increase this year, even if we don't
get any change in rates or anything like that. For example, I think you put on some securities or purchased some
securities in the first quarter. What was the timing of those purchases or the rates et cetera?
And then as I look at your sort of debt, it seems to me like there's over $1 billion of higher cost in debt including
some trust preferred that's out there. Are there some opportunities out there to retire some of that debt that could
actually help NII over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes. You are right, Alex, in that we did some movement of cash into the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter,
as you recall. We did some more of that also in the first quarter. In the first quarter, it was largely the latter part of
the quarter. So while you see the balances going up, a lot of the impact in net income of that movement will
actually happen in the second quarter.
But you want to reduce the first quarter to its core. The core is just PPP. PPP is what made the difference
between margins stay inside from maybe even going down a little bit versus going up. So, that will continue to be
true in the second quarter. And then as you know, the other big, big elephant in the room for us is asset mix. If we
– depending on the level and magnitude of influx of deposits, that will have a big say in our margin as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And if we just boil it down, take out PPP, right, because that's obviously getting volatile and take out cash and
maybe just ignore the NIM and just look at NII, for those securities purchases, what was the – there's $1.2 billion if
I'm not mistaken – what was kind of the blended yield on that that could potentially help a little bit in the second
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I don't remember exactly. I think it was probably certainly under 1%. That's probably the range in which it was,
Alex. But don't remember that. So that fees goes up from [ph] 10 basis points (39:49) to something probably
under 1%. I do remember that those are mostly treasuries, they are tax free from our point of view.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
But the other piece of the puzzle is of course all the run-offs that we're having from the investment portfolio is
higher yielding stuff that keeps running up. So 1% is better than 10 basis points. But you know if you have stuff
running off at this time, was it 2.5%, it still weighs on the NIM – on NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then what about the trust preferreds or other higher costing debt? Is there an opportunity to retire that
at some point in 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
We will continue to look at opportunities to manage our capital for the remainder of the year. I mean, I think our
statement stands for itself.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then as I – just circling back to the loan growth question, obviously it's a pretty tough current as when
we get this year. But as you kind of line up some of the things that are going to be happening over the next year
or so, as in bankruptcy, rebuilding the power grid, rebuilding the housing stock, resurgence in tourism, the end of
the expanded unemployment benefits, maybe putting some people back into the workforce, it seems like loan
growth as we look into 2022, it might not just trickle back on but just really explode out of the gates.
Is there anything with that thinking that is flawed, and what are you guys doing to prepare for a potential just huge
ramp-up in loan growth next year, if you think that's possible?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think we have the resources, and talking about the human and technical resources to handle that. The loan sizes
in Puerto Rico have grown over the years. So, we're expecting that a lot of that will be in larger loans. And that's
something that's a bit more efficient to handle. We're looking at the different industries that have potential for
growth. We're talking closely to our clients. We are seeing a lot of renewed interest from mainland investors
coming to Puerto Rico looking for opportunities. And we're getting good referrals from people that know us.
So, we are not just waiting for people to come into our office. We're trying to predict what's going to happen in the
future. We're talking to people asking what they expect their needs are going to be. So, really, I think we're ready.
We just need to see it materialize. And as I said in my remarks, we're in a good position to take advantage of the
opportunities that we really see are coming.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
