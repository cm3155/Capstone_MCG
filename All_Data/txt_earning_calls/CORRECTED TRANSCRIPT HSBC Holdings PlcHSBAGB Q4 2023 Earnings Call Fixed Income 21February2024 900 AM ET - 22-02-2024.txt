MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Faisal Yousaf
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm Fas Yousaf, Treasurer, and I'm joined by Greg Case, Head of
Debts, Investor Relations; and Mark Phin, Head of Equity Investor Relations. I'll keep my opening remarks
relatively brief as I'm sure you've had a chance to go through the results over the course of the day. There is also
a comprehensive debt for fixed income investors available on our website and we'll flash up a few selected slides
as I talk. Once I finished, we'll go straight to Q&A.
So, today we announced a good set of underlying fourth quarter results and record full year profit before tax of
$30.3 billion. 2023 reported revenue was $66.1 billion, driven by supportive interest rates and underlying business
growth. The return on average tangible equity for 2023 was 14.6%. We returned $19 billion to shareholders and
we've announced a further up to $2 billion buyback to be completed ahead of 1Q results. We continue to target
mid-teens RoTE for 2024.
During the year, we acquired what was SVB UK, which has enabled us to build our global innovation banking
proposition. We also completed the sale of our French retail business on the 1st of January this year, and
following approval from the Canadian government the sale of our Canadian business is on track to complete in
Q1. We are mindful of where we are in the interest rate cycle, as such we have been and will continue to be
focused on lowering our earnings sensitivity through hedging, driving growth in non-interest income and, of
course, cost discipline.
Moving to the quarterly view briefly, in the fourth quarter, revenue was $13 billion. Our underlying profit before tax
was impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items and $0.5 billion related to hyperinflation in Argentina. The notable
items largely consisted of the re-recognition of an impairment related to the sale of our French retail business and
the impairment of our stake in Bank of Communications or BoCom.
Turning to credit quality, for the full year, the ECL charge was $3.4 billion or 33 basis points. As we look out to
2024, we expect our cost of risk to be at around 40 basis points given the ongoing macro uncertainty. For

Q4 2023 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 21-Feb-2024
Mainland China CRE, the full year ECL charge on the portfolio was $1 billion, in line with the full year plausible
downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main focus with respect to this portfolio remains the
mainland China CRE portfolio booked in Hong Kong, which has reduced by $3.1 billion in 2023 overall and now
sits at $6.3 billion gross, with provisions of $1.8 billion against it.
Turning to structural hedging, our Banking NII sensitivity to a 100 basis point down-shock is $3.4 billion. This has
reduced by just over 50% since June 2022, with more than a third of this due to structural interest rate hedging.
Our structural hedge size and duration has increased during the year. The hedge has a weighted average life of
2.8 years and subject to market conditions we expect to increase the notional and duration further in 2024. As
part of our structural hedging activity, we took $1 billion of Treasury disposal losses in 2023 for risk management
purposes. The replacement hedge is a longer duration with a higher yield.
Now, moving on to balance sheet and issuance. Firstly, a few words on our capital position. CET1 ratio remained
strong at 14.8%, up 0.6 percentage points in 2023 and broadly stable in the fourth quarter. At the end of the
quarter, we were $31 billion or 3.6 percentage points above our MDA level, which was 11.2%. During the year, we
generated one percentage point of capital through earnings after making shareholder distributions of 0.9
percentage points. The group remains highly capital generative. The impairments of BoCom had no significant
impact on our CET1 ratio and we expect the sale of our Canadian business to add 1.2 percentage points to the
ratio on completion in the first quarter of this year.
CET1 planned operating range remains 14% to 14.5%. I'd expect our CET1 ratio to remain above this range for
the next few quarters given the disposal of Canada. Our MREL ratio was 31.6% of RWAs, 4.9 percentage points
above our requirement and we expect to maintain a prudent buffer. The group retained strong levels of liquidity
with a well-diversified deposit base. We have a total deposit base of $1.6 trillion and our loan to deposit ratio is
58%. We hold $0.8 trillion in high quality liquid assets and the group LCR rose 4 percentage points to 136% in the
year. I would highlight here that the consolidated LCR is calculated using conservative assumptions and major
subsidiaries [ph] all operate (00:06:31) LCRs that are significantly higher than the consolidated level.
Finally, moving onto issuance and starting with Holdco senior, this year's plan is lower than our usual run rate with
negative net issuance likely. We see gross issuance of less than $10 billion against maturities and calls of around
$12 billion. We would expect to be closer to previous year's issuance levels in 2025 and beyond. I'd also note that
last year we reduced our reliance on the US dollar market with around 60% of our senior HoldCo being in US
dollars, compared to around 80% historically.
For Tier 2, we expect to issue $2 billion to $3 billion gross in 2024 against $2 billion of maturities. This will broadly
be half of the amount we issued in 2023. With respect to AT1, we have modest needs this year, particularly given
anticipated [ph] extra (00:07:41) CET1 position. At this stage, we plan to issue around $2 billion of gross AT1, but
we'll keep this under evaluation over the course of the year. We have just over $2 billion of AT1 with available call
options in 2024.
So in summary, a good year with record profitability, mid-teens return on tangible equity and $19 billion of returns
to shareholders. Our capital position is strong with good capital generation through earnings. We maintain prudent
funding and liquidity positions and we have modest issuance needs in 2024. We're confident about the future,
having built a business model that provides balanced growth, good returns with improved stability. On that note,
let's open the call up for Q&A. Greg?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Fas. So, if you'd like to signal for question, please use the raise your hand function in Zoom and then
we'll ask you to unmute your line. I'm afraid, as I did note in my emails, we won't be able to take calls from people
who've dialed in by the phones. So, if you'd like to ask a question, please do email me directly and I'll happily read
that out.
So in the meantime, while we wait for people to signal for questions, we have a first question submitted from Tom
Jenkins at Jefferies. And Tom asks when are you going to address your legacy Tier 1, specifically the £5,844s
and the $10,176s?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thank you, Tom. So, probably there are three different dimensions I'd like to cover here. I guess, to start
with, as we've said before, we're in active dialogue with our regulators on our legacy stack. And I would say there
is a good understanding on both sides. As you know, the Bank of England expect firms to take what they describe
as appropriate and proportionate steps to reduce legacy instruments. And that's very much in line with our own
strategy. We have made some progress over the past couple of years, so two or three years, I would say,
reducing the balance by over $6 billion. There's a slide in the deck that gives a bit more detail on that. But
nevertheless, we still have around $9 billion remaining. And this is something that I'm very focused on trying to
address.
To talk a little bit about the way we think about prioritizing this, this legacy stack, the various factors we take into
account and I guess in no particular order, one of the first things we'd look at is assessing the complexity and the
options to resolve legacy instruments. We'd obviously look at the economics and the size of the issuance and
think about pursuing fair treatment for bondholders and shareholders alike. And obviously, the regulatory
guidance comes into that. And that's what's really influenced the priority order that we look at this stuff in.
So, that's kind of a general view on our approach. But specifically, I guess, Tom, to your question, I can't share at
this point any specifics about instruments and what we intend to do. But I think it's reasonable to assume that in
the case that you describe, some of the problems are likely to be down to complexity involved, maybe the legal
conditions, timing and costs. And as I said earlier, we're really looking at reasonable and proportionate steps
where we can. On the [indiscernible] (00:11:23) specifically, we've not taken action yet. And as you know, it's
been over two years since the conditions allowed us to. So, you could probably assume that it's just not conducive
at this point to take those actions. Hopefully, that addresses your question.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 21-Feb-2024
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions. First on capital generation and I'm going kind of
back and forth between presentations, but it looks like you generate about 1% CET1 or did in the past year. 25
basis points per quarter or so, it's a little lumpy, but do you think that's the right run rate there, number one.
Number two, with respect to putting that into dividends and buybacks, it seems like you used about half your
generated capital to do that. Is that a good metric to look at?
And then on the UK ring fenced bank ROTE for the year over 28%. Could you talk about the performance there?
You've had an abundance of deposits there that you've deployed both in mortgages and now it appears more
penetration for large corporates. Could you talk about some of the wins that you've had there and how you see
the business going forward, how you're going to maintain margins and how you see asset quality development?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thanks, Rob. Quite a few questions there, I'll try to address them. So, first of all, on the capital generation
piece, yes, as you said, I think I quoted in my prepared notes that we see 1% capital generation, but that was
after dividends and buybacks. And so, the capital generation is in excess of that year-on-year at the moment
given where we are. So, I think that's worth bearing in mind. You're right though, in terms of your math, on the 25
basis points, it is 25 basis points per quarter at $2 billion buyback. So, we did $7 billion of buyback in 2023 and
we just announced a further $2 billion for this quarter.
So overall, on the capital generation and our capability to retain that kind of flow of dividend payout ratio and
buybacks, we're pretty confident at this stage given where we are in the rate cycle. And obviously we'll monitor
that fairly closely. And I'm not giving any guidance just for clarity in terms of future buybacks, but we will think that
through as we go along. And we've got, obviously, the Canada sale coming up hopefully to complete at the end of
Q1, which will bolster our cash position.
On the ring fenced bank comment and question. Yeah, look, we've had a very healthy return on tangible equity,
as you point out. We are seeing competitive pricing pressure in deposits in the UK generally. I think there are
probably a few factors that drive that. The upcoming TF SME refinancing in the market, it might be one of those
factors. Cost of living and Q2 pressures might be others as well. I think my own view is that you see some of the
smaller players that don't have access necessarily to the capital markets as wanting to be particularly competitive
on pricing. There are, obviously, as we know, also economic uncertainties which have been well discussed and
we need to see how that all plays out. But from our perspective, the economy has been very resilient indeed and
we continue to see strong performance. Then obviously, we're not being complacent. Our view is that, as rates
start to come down and decline, that should trigger [ph] for our (00:15:51) small lending and get the balance sheet
moving a little bit more.
Overall, just to give you perhaps a little bit more color on the UK deposit picture and [ph] perhaps broaden out
(00:16:02), because I think it'll be of interest to others as well and talk a bit about the Hong Kong. Deposits, we've
seen in the UK come down year-on-year by about $22 billion. That's reflective of the broader industry trends that I
talked about and the pressures on customers. We've seen in that WPB balances come down by about $14 billion,
in CMB come down by about $8 billion.
So, that covers the UK bank. But more broadly, if we look at the overall group, we've seen a positive uptick in
Hong Kong deposits. That's pretty much as the Asia in totality is about $22 billion up on the year. And a third of
that is due to the deposit campaign that we pursued in the fourth quarter. So overall, that's what's – that's some

color to the overall movement that we've seen in our deposit base at the group level. And you can see overall
deposits for the year are up. That does take into account some of the [ph] SVB asset (00:17:19) acquisition as
well. Hopefully, that addresses both of your questions.

No problem. Thank you, Rob. Have a good day.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Rob. So, we've got a question submitted in from Panos Toskas at NatWest. And so, first this asks, can
we have a clarification around your IBOR expo securities, you say on the slides that we do not intend to use
LIBOR as a means to extract value from holders of our MREL and regulatory capital. What does this mean
specifically? And does it refer to all currencies and across cost of capital stack?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thank you, Panos. Thank you for the question. So, probably a few factors to talk through here. Look, our
overarching principle really that we're working towards is that we want to work together with investors to reach a
solution that's mutually agreeable and in line, of course, with regulatory requirements. Now, obviously, that may
not be possible in all cases, but our approach is to try to not leave investors with legacy LIBOR risk without first
offering them some kind of market standard reach out.
We've made some pleasing progress, and what I would describe as pleasing progress on remediation over a few
years now, as I think you will know, Panos, that we undertook successful consents on our sterling English law
securities in 2021, I think it was. And we also redeemed some of our saving bonds in 2022 and we made
announcements in 2023 detailing alterations that we would make for US securities following the LIBOR Act and
ARRC fallbacks.
But onto the particular statement that we added to our slides in terms of not extracting value, really what we're
trying to do is clarify that we don't view relying on the 81 fallbacks as a credible path to mitigation if it involves the
transfer of value from bondholders to us. That's not our intent here. So, we want to, as I said a minute ago, offer
some form of the mediation exercise. Now, obviously, if holders choose not to take up that offer, which they are
obviously free to continue to do so under the existing terms, our view given the current rate dynamics, it's
probably not economically beneficial for them to do so, but obviously that's a choice. So, that's really what we
were trying to get across in that statement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Fas. And so, the next question we've got comes from Paul Fenner. So, a number of questions, Paul. So,
I might simplify this a little bit. Apologies. So firstly, in terms of AT1, given your messaging and the capital levels,
is it just as likely that you do no issuance this year or will you do [ph] the two (00:20:44)? And also furthermore on

issuance, how do you think about currencies for this year excluding US dollars, how will you think about euros, I
guess, specifically?
And finally on the loan to deposit ratio, it's incredibly low now at 58%. What's the right level? And is there a
strategy around this at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the question. So on AT1, actually let me take a step back for a minute just to talk
about the overall 2024, 2024 issuance. So, as I said in my prepared notes, on the senior HoldCo, we're expecting
a pretty modest year and that is driven by averages borrowing demand, but also what will be elevated cash
position that we expect following the sale of Canada. On AT1, what we've typically looking to do, we did a little bit
of pre-financing of our redemptions in 2023.
So, we did $2 billion of the $4 billion in 2023. And now, we're largely looking back and looking to move to a
position where we fully replace any redeemed AT1. So, this year is probably a little bit different. And given the
excess CET1 position, I expect to continue to look at the utility of any new issue and that's why we've guided to
approximately $2 billion. We'll look at that call and we'll look at whether what else we've got in our CET1 position
at the time.
On currencies, so as I also said earlier, that we've somewhat reduced our reliance last year on US dollar, but US
dollar is really very important to us. It's over. It's around about half, perhaps a bit over in terms of our RWAs, that's
US dollar and US dollar linked instruments. That said, we will look to diversify where levels are attractive. We
have our ring fenced bank, which is almost exclusively a sterling balance sheet. Now, I'm aware of the heightened
spread levels in that market and thought for about how we'd access the market given it's fairly small. But we will
obviously look at sterling, euro, which was, I think specifically your question will be another area we think very
carefully about. Sing would be a third and perhaps a few other currencies. So, that's probably all I can offer at this
point in time.
And then finally, I think there was a comment about a loan-to-deposit ratio. And yeah, it is very healthy and we
continue to look at that. We have a healthy liquidity position as well in a number of our legal entities, as you will
have seen in the slide deck. There's nothing I can share at this point in time in terms of changing that or target.
We don't have a particular target. We are expecting loan demand to pick up later on in the year. And we'll see
how that plays out, really.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks Fas. So, we've had another submitted question from Dan David at Autonomous. And so, Dan asks, I think
three questions here. Firstly, on leverage, can you comment on the increase in Q4 in the European Resolution
Group? Is this a sign of a longer term trend or shorter term? On legacy, do you have a target for the reduction in
the amount outstanding in 2024? And specifically regarding the make-whole bonds, that would be the Tier-1s,
would a 50 basis point cut in central bank rates push the economics in your favor to take action?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. I'll deal with the legacy one. Perhaps, Greg, I'll ask you to talk a bit about the leverage question. So, on
legacy, in terms of whether we have a target outstanding? No, not explicitly. As I said earlier, we maintain

continuous dialogue with the regulator, and we are looking at options now. But there's no target that I can share
with you at this stage. And on the 50-basis points reduction, it really depends on which securities one is looking
at. In some cases it could be beneficial. In others, not so much. Greg?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, sure. So Dan, I don't think there's one specific thing I would point towards on the increase in leverage in the
European business. I think there is a few moving pieces. So, of course, that the European Resolution Group
houses are a non-ring fenced bank, which is a global booking center for our markets business. So, that will
naturally flex up and down as we see opportunities. And I wouldn't say [ph] and necessarily call out (00:25:56) a
longer term trend there at this stage. The other one to bear in mind, though, is there is a bit of noise here.
So, you'll recall that the European Unions required us to consolidate all of our European Union businesses into –
underneath one subsidiary as the IPU. That requirement came in at the end of the year. We made a few transfers
from outside of the European resolution group into the European resolution group, which increased its notional
assets at the same time. So, there's a few pieces there, but nothing, nothing I'd add specifically call out is driving
it.
Moving on, so we have an anonymous question come in. So, Fas, would you mind walking us through the why we
have a lower level of issuance this year and how confident you are in this negative net issuance for HoldCo
Senior specifically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Yes, sure. Okay. Perhaps I'll start with just talking a little bit about what we did in 2023. So, we had, I was pretty
happy with where we ended up in 2023, actually. We had [ph] an over issuance (00:27:10) plan for senior HoldCo
of $17 billion to $19 billion, which we communicated at the beginning of the year. We landed at about $19 billion.
So, the lower end of the range. And as I said earlier, about 60% of that was US, 30% or so was Euro and the
West sterling and other currencies.
For Tier 2, we have a issuance plan of $4 billion to $5 billion that we communicated at the beginning of 2023,
ended up at around $5 billion, and then for AT1 it was $2 billion and $2 billion. So, happy in 2023 and as the
questionnaire has widely observed, it is more modest this year. And really, we have a pretty good degree of
confidence actually in the plans that we have. There are uncertainties, nevertheless, in terms of if loan demand
picks up, that might prompt us to change. Obviously, it's somewhat contingent on us concluding some of our
disposals this year as well, Canada in particular. But really on the Senior HoldCo, what we're saying is up to $10
billion in terms of the plan this year and that as you will have had compares to 2017.
Now, I'm expecting us to – sorry, and that makes us a net negative [ph] issuer (00:28:40) then in the Senior
HoldCo. I'm expecting us to return to more 2023 levels in 2025. So, this year is probably somewhat unusual in our
thinking. So, that's on Senior HoldCo, which I think was a question. But actually just for completeness, I
mentioned a little bit about Tier 2 and AT1. Tier 2 likely to be $2 billion to $3 billion this year. And that's probably
the runway on a go forward basis. And then AT1, as I said earlier, it's probably like-for-like in terms of as we call,
we'll look to replace and we don't necessarily need to pre-fund in order to replace, but we will probably go along
those kind of lines.

Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Fas. So, we've had another question come in but just to flag it, if you do want to ask a question over the
line, please do raise your hand and we'll open you up. So, this comes in from Lee Street at Citi. Lee asks, you
highlight the $6.3 billion of Mainland China exposure, but the bank also has a lot of other real estate exposure to
Hong Kong and China. Please, can you give us some color on what is happening generically with those
exposures and why they are seen differently?
And secondly, Lee also asks, the [ph] MREL (00:30:06) buffer is, is $42 billion. Why is that buffer so high and
what level could you realistically envisage reducing that number down to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thanks, Lee. I was expecting you actually to call in, so thank you for the question anyway. So, there is a
slide in our deck, I think is around 35 in the fixed income that, page 35 says probably in the appendices, which
breaks our commercial real estate exposure year-on-year. And I think the things I'd call out are that on a full-year
basis, we've reduced the overall CRE exposure by around 13% from memory. So, it's now about $83.5 billion
around the world. The kind of areas that I would perhaps zoom in on and focus on is Hong Kong. And we have
reduced those numbers from $50 billion down to $42 billion, so around 15% reduction. And when you drill into that
detail, if – one of the reasons we look at this differently is that is not necessarily residential mortgages, as you
would see in the China CRE space, It could be office or other types of commercial, real estate, retail, et cetera.
The office exposure that we have was around 8% down in 2023 and is down, I think, around 26% versus our
peak, which is around about 2018. So, we've reduced that exposure somewhat and we remain comfortable with it.
Actually, there's nothing I would call out in terms of a worry there at this point. Also in the US, we have made
substantial reductions in 2023. I think that may have been commented on earlier in the day and that's come down
to just under $4 billion, so down about 27% in terms of our CRE.
I would also draw your attention on the same slide, slide 35, to our LTV analysis, which shows that in Hong Kong
the LTV, 70-plus-percent of our LTV is less than 50%. And in the UK, similarly, we have a very healthy LTV
position. So, that's all, I think, very positive.
Now, on the second part of your question, if I recall correctly, you were talking about the $42 billion. The majority
of that is CET1. And we have a prudent buffer in place. There are obviously regulatory constraints there, but we're
confident about those debt buffers. I guess, that's probably all I'd comment on. But, Greg, perhaps I'd welcome
you to make any comments you have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, I guess you know that the majority is CET1. So, as you can imagine, given the MDA level is 11.2 and
we're operating at 14.8, the bulk of that [ph] MREL (00:33:33) buffer is in CET1. So, it's going to largely follow that
track. And I think elsewhere, we're broadly comfortable with those buffers.
And so, we have a call coming in off the line of [ph] Phil Fuller from Decker (00:33:48). [ph] Phil (00:33:49), your
line is open.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi [ph] Phil (00:33:56).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. So, my question around this quarter, you've published lots of negatives with Bank of Communications and
so on. Do you think now everything negative is like off the table or will these stories, these negative stories like on
China CRE provisions and Bank of Communications and Argentina and so on, will they continue in the next
quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi [ph] Phil (00:34:27). So, I mean, it's always going to be very, very hard to predict these items, but I think, yeah,
certainly unfortunate the significant numbers of one-offs that did come through the results in Q4. And of course,
we'd hope that it's a smaller number in future and there were a number of quarters in 2023 that were pretty clean,
actually.
So, yeah, it's unfortunate that they all came through in Q4, made it understandably difficult to pick through. And in
terms of the BoCom impairment, we've been doing that calculation on a quarterly basis for a very long time.
Effectively the fact that the market value of our ownership is below our carrying value is an indicator that we need
to do an impairment test. It's simply that we've got to the point in that impairment test that it's crystallized a $3
billion loss. We'll continue to do those tests in the coming quarters as long as it is necessary for us to do so. And
of course, we couldn't rule out further impairments, but there's nothing [ph] to add (00:35:26) at this stage.
And Argentina hyperinflation, that has been feature for a long time in our results but it's been relatively minor.
What you saw in Q4 was a very significant devaluation in the peso, which accelerated a significant volume of that
into Q4 – at the adjustment into Q4. And of course, that will again, it's out of our control to the extent that a further
adjustment is necessary that will be determined by the – how the currency moves and the inflation in Argentina.
But, yes, we'd love to see as many clean quarters as we can in future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
And a second question, if I may.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Phil, just before you do, I just wanted to add to that, add to Greg's response. I would comment that the adjustment
that was made, as Greg has indicated, is a technical accounting adjustment, and it had no impact on CET1 ratio,
no impact on our dividends. And overall, as you've heard already. I mean, there's a very positive story in terms of
our dividends and payouts for 2023. I should also say, as was said in the call it this morning, it doesn't change our

strategy to Mainland China, there's no impacts on our strategic relationship with BoCom and no impact on HSBC
or BoCom's operations or strategic outlook. It is purely an accounting calculation. The VIU test, the value-in-use
test, which we're mandated to do on a quarterly basis. And we're not expecting or anticipating any further
adjustments at this stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thank you. And just one last question, if I may.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Your, the HoldCo bonds that you issued, the HoldCo Seniors, do you account them at fair value still so that you
might need to more or less depending on where rates go?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Yes, we do. We account for them at fair value. We know that we take a conservative approach for our MREL and
capital stack. We believe that's the right way to value these instruments albeit there are a variety of practices, and
that we know that the regulators are looking at this with welcome clarity. But we use fair value to value them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And just to add to that [ph] Phil (00:38:02) just to finalize that, I know that this has been a headwind to us in
previous years. In 2023, it was actually a tailwind. So, some of that negative mark-to-market that we accrued
through the regulatory ratios in 2022 did come back to some extent, particularly in the fourth quarter. So all in, it's
probably benefited us by $3 billion, $4 billion, I'd say, at this stage. But, of course, that will always be dependent
on the path of rates and how that changes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Yeah, I've got in the back of my mind that we were at 8% [ph] negative value (00:38:35) at one stage and we're
4.5% as at year end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
That's right, Fas. Yeah. And so, we've had – thanks for your question, [ph] Phil (00:38:43). We've had another
question in from Iuliana Golub from Goldman Sachs. Iuliana asks, can you please comment on the Mexican
business cost of risk outlook for 2024? It looks like a fairly high charge in Q4 for the unsecured consumer book.
And I'll take that. So, yeah, look, we're growing that business. So, as we grow that business, there's two things to
think about. So firstly, growing arguably at a higher risk booked than we typically originate around the rest of the

group, given Mexican unsecured business will generate meaningful Stage 1 and Stage 2 charges and we do that
just because of the day one recognition. In addition, of course, as we grow that book, we will be fine tuning risk
over time, but the level of impairments that we're generating in that business we're comfortable with and is fully
reflected in the pricing that we're getting on the asset side.
So, yes, it is contributing and we are conscious of that and it is still a pretty small business in the grand scheme of
things is certainly on the balance sheet side. And you'll see Mexico still remains a relatively modest contributor to
the loan book compared to its profit contributions. But yes, I think something we will continue to keep our eye on.
And I think that draws us to an end. I think we've got through all the questions that have been. So. Oh, sorry.
We've got a question from [ph] Rob Thomas (00:40:26) on the line. [ph] Rob (00:40:27), your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Just to follow up, on just Argentina. Can you remind me what business you do there and what the importance of
that business is for the group?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, we've got a historic operation in Argentina. It's a full service business, albeit it's got smaller in recent years, I
think particularly on the retail side. And it does what most of our subsidiaries do around the world. It provides part
of our international network and is a broader largely corporate institutional business there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
No problem. So, yeah, I think that's all the questions, all the questions we have. So, Fas, I just hand it back to you
if you want to wrap up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Faisal Yousaf
Group Treasurer, HSBC Investment Bank Plc
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone for your time today, and for joining us. I hope you found the call useful. If
you do have further questions, please do pick up with Greg and the IR team and we are looking forward to seeing
some of you when we are on the road over the next few weeks and months. Thank you very much and have a
good day.
