Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, thank you, Doug. And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our year-end earnings call. I am Andy
Harmening, and I'm joined here today by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief
Credit Officer. I want to start things off by sharing highlights for the quarter and then reflecting on 2022 as a
whole. From there, Derek will walk through an update on margins, income statement trends and capital, and then
Pat will provide an update on credit.
So no matter how you slice it, 2022 was a statement year in Associated's 162-year history. It was driven by a
relentless focus on customers and on our colleagues. We executed against our strategic plan with several
milestones achieved in 2022. We staffed and ramped up new commercial and consumer verticals that have since
met or exceeded their initial target, giving us a little bit more flexibility to drive balanced loan and balanced deposit
growth for the bank.
We attracted top talent from several major competitors within our footprint and added 20 net new commercial
RMs during the year giving us momentum as an employer of choice. We launched the most significant digital
platform upgrade in our company's history, with our new Associated Bank digital platform and then within 90 days,
we followed that up with a new account opening platform. This gives us a much improved digital experience for
our customers and the ability to make future enhancements more frequently.
And leveraging these digital enhancements, we officially launched new mass affluent and digital sales strategies,
giving us the ability to attract and deepen more quality customer relationships. All of these efforts have enabled us
to drive positive operating leverage, improve our returns, and serve our customers more efficiently and more
effectively. And while we've grown a lot, in a lot of ways in 2022, it's important to reiterate that we've done so in a
controlled fashion. We remain firmly committed to maintaining our discipline around credit quality and expense
management.
These foundational strengths have been developed over the course of a decade and will continue to serve as our
foundation as we look to deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders. These results also set the table for
2023. And in January, we continue to be impressed by the strength and resilience of our Midwest markets in the
face of macro uncertainty. Unemployment rates remain stable and with Wisconsin and Minnesota continuing to
come in below the national average. Our consumers remain resilient with increased debit and credit card
spending levels in December of 2022 versus December of 2021.
Our business customers continue to pursue growth and expansion opportunities where it makes sense. But the
uncertain macro environment is front and center in all conversations. Taken together with the rising rate
environment, these trends have enabled us to enjoy another strong quarter here in Q4 and have given us
momentum into the new year. We continue to monitor the significant macroeconomic and geopolitical question
marks that remain, but we believe we put ourselves in a good position to build on our momentum and drive value
for our stakeholders without stretching to take additional risk.
With that, I'd like to highlight a few items outlined on slide 2. Our fourth quarter results reflected continued loan
and deposit growth, further margin expansion and benign credit impacts. We once again saw strong loan growth
across all major segments, but as we anticipated, the pace of growth slowed somewhat versus the prior quarter in
most key categories. Based on a combination of our customer activity and our markets, the execution of our
strategic plan and the rising rate environment, our net interest income increased 9% quarter-over-quarter and
55% versus the same quarter in the prior year. With the expenses held flat for the quarter, we once again drove
positive operating leverage and we pushed our return on common equity north of 16% for the quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
On the credit side, we continue to closely monitor our portfolios, but fourth quarter trends remain benign. During
the quarter, we saw just 2 basis points of net charge-offs. We did add provision again this quarter, but is once
again largely a function of our loan growth. Looking at 2022 as a whole, our fourth quarter results were a fitting
exclamation point on what has turned out to be the most profitable fiscal year in Associated Bank's history through
a combination of strength in our markets, execution of our growth initiatives, and help from rising rates. We drove
over 41% increase in PTPP income, posted double-digit operating leverage and added nearly $4.6 billion in high-
quality loan balances. Despite a $121 million provision-driven headwind versus the prior year, we're still able to
drive a 6% increase in our net income available to common equity year-over-year. And while we're proud of these
accomplishments, our focus is on building off this momentum in 2023.
With that, I'd like to provide a little bit more color around our loan trends. Slide 3 once again underscores the
broad, diversified impact of Associated loans growth story. For the third consecutive quarter, we reported growth
in nearly every major loan vertical. Our construction portfolio led the way with the bulk of balanced growth driven
by funding of prior commitments and a slowdown in payout â€“ payoff activity as opposed to new production. We
did see broad, high-quality loan growth in several other businesses, but in most cases, the pace of growth slowed
versus the prior quarter as expected.
Shifting to slide 4, this annual view of our loan trends shows a clearer picture of the broad-based growth and
optionality provided by our various lending initiatives. As discussed in the past, this dynamic reflects the strength
of our markets and franchise, but it also highlights the diversifying nature of our initiatives. This gives us additional
levers that we can pull to drive balanced, durable growth across the portfolio over time in different economic and
in different economic environments, without feeling like we need to stretch in one particular area.
Slide 5 provides a bit more color on the status of our strategic initiatives. As we discussed last quarter, our effort
to bolster our commercial ranks with talented RMs in markets like Milwaukee and Chicago have played a
significant role in adding quality core commercial loans to our balance sheet. While some of the balances came
from draws on existing lines, we also increased the volume of new commercial relationships by 57% year-over-
year with a vast majority of new names coming in our core three state footprint.
This activity helped us achieve our full-year commercial loan growth target by September. But it also sets us up to
drive a more holistic relationship that includes deposits, Treasury management and other services. We expect to
see additional core commercial loan growth in 2023, but at a slower pace compared to 2022. Our new ABL and
equipment finance verticals also established solid momentum throughout the year as each team developed their
respective pipelines and steadily added balances as a natural fit for our customer base.
As a result, the teams comfortably cleared their $300 million growth target for 2022, and we expect to continue
growing these businesses in 2023. On the consumer front, our auto finance team has continued to produce high-
quality fixed rate loans that help diversify our consumer loan book with decades of experience executing a
prime/super-prime strategy in a variety of environments, this team knows the auto business and their approach is
a natural fit for our conservative credit culture.
With that said, I've also stated previously that the diversifying impact of our initiatives give us the ability to scale
up or down without having to over-index on any one approach. And with that in mind, we've intentionally slowed
our auto production rate slightly to reflect current market conditions as we head into 2023. We also continue to
expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of the year. And all-in-all, we
expect to drive total period end of loan growth of 7% to 9% in 2023.

Turning to slide 6, we highlight our fourth quarter deposit trends. On an average basis, we grew deposits by 2%
quarter-over-quarter and by 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. This growth came despite inflation and
increasing competitive pressures in the market and was a reflection of the strategic actions we've taken to
cultivate our low-cost granular deposit base and attract and deepen holistic relationships. As we've discussed in
the past, we recognize that generating low-cost funding is more crucial than ever, and particularly as we look to
fund our growth strategies on the lending side.
While we did add brokered CDs and network deposits to our balances in Q4, a majority of our balance growth for
the year was driven by core customer deposits. We're comfortable flexing wholesale and network funding levels in
the short-term, but we expect to hold this type of funding in check as we move through the year. We continue to
monitor the competitive environment closely and remain confident in our ability to fund the bank at a reasonable
cost in 2023 and beyond, based on the initiatives we have in [ph] place (12:26).
Slide 7 highlights an annual average view of our deposit flows. In 2022, we saw average deposit growth for the
11th consecutive year, despite the steadily increasing inflation â€“ inflationary and competitive pressures we saw
throughout the year, we were still able to grow average annual deposits by 4%. On a quarterly year-over-year
basis, core customer deposits were once again the driving force behind our growth, led by savings, money market
and interest-bearing demand categories.
Shifting to slide 8, there is no denying that the competitive pressures will be amplified in 2023 as the battle for
deposits continues. That's why we've been hard at work for the past year on several initiatives designed to help
us cultivate customer relationships, fund growth with lower cost core deposits. In fact, some of these initiatives
have already started to have an impact. In 2022, we drove a 21% increase in commercial RMs compared to year-
end 2021. This in turn led to a 57% year-over-year increase in new customer names, many of which brought
deposits and non-loan business to the bank as renewed our focus on driving holistic relationships.
These efforts have been complemented by a sharpened focus on businesses that allow us to deepen those
commercial relationships, including Treasury management where we've increased sales activity by 50%, HSA
where we've hired a new National Sales Director and other deposit-centric businesses. On the consumer side, we
launched a new digital account opening platform, providing customers and prospects with a modern, simplified
digital storefront. This upgrade gave us the confidence to launch our new acquisition-focused mass affluent and
digital sales initiatives in the fourth quarter. While it's still early, we've seen promising initial production in the
segment such as savings and CDs.
With each of these initiatives launching over the course of 2022, some have impacted our 2022 results more than
others, but all of them are expected to provide a full-year impact in 2023. And to further capitalize on this
momentum in 2023, we've shifted our marketing spend from a sponsorship focus to a customer acquisition with a
new brand campaign set to launch next month. And beginning in the second quarter, we intend to launch a new
product or digital service every quarter in 2023, with an eye towards increased customer and deposit acquisition.
In summary with the battle for deposits continuing to heat up, we've acted â€“ we are actively pursuing a variety of
levers to drive core customer funding at a reasonable cost. I've directly experienced the launch of similar
programs several times in previous stops. I'm confident that we can achieve positive results at Associated
regardless of the environment. In 2023, we expect to drive total core customer deposit growth 3% to 5%.
Finally on slide 9, our initiatives have helped generate strong revenues for our company in 2022, coupled with our
diligent management of expenses, we've continued to deliver significant operating leverage and PTPP income

growth. For the full year of 2022, our PTPP income grew by 41%. We remain committed to delivering positive
operating leverage in 2023.
With that, I'll pull up there and hand it over to Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide further detail on
our margin, revenue and income statement trends for the quarter. Derek?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Slide 10 highlights our yield trends and the asset sensitive nature of our balance sheet. On the
asset side, average earning asset yields continue to expand meaningfully in the fourth quarter. Over the course of
the year, earning asset yields increased by 187 basis points or roughly 52% of the increase we've seen in the Fed
funds target rate over the same period, reflecting our core asset sensitivity.
On the liability side, 2022 interest-bearing liability costs have now increased 131 basis points, or roughly 37% of
the move in Fed funds target. While the pace of liability costs started to increase in the back half of the year, this
increase was largely â€“ has largely tracked with our expectations. And we continue to monitor these costs closely.
Despite the rising liability costs in the fourth quarter, we continue to see significant quarter-over-quarter expansion
in our net interest margin as shown on slide 10 â€“ I'm sorry, slide 11. We view this as a reflection of our recent loan
growth, coupled with our structural asset sensitivity. During Q4, our net interest margin expanded by 18 basis
points versus the prior quarter. This expansion equated to a $25 million lift in our net interest income versus Q3.
And on a full-year basis, our NII grew by 32% or $231 million as compared to 2021.
Moving to slide 12. Several factors have enabled us to continue benefiting from the current rate environment. As
we've discussed, these factors include our natural assets sensitivity, reduce reliance on wholesale, network
funding versus the prior rate cycle, and our ability to manage interest-bearing deposit betas.
While we do expect the betas to continue increasing into 2023, these broader dynamics have us poised to
continue benefiting in the near-term. With that said, the lack of clarity around the macroeconomic forecast carries
significant uncertainty for the industry into 2023. As a result, we continue to take meaningful actions to manage
through this uncertainty and reduce our interest rate risk.
Over the back half of 2022, we executed over $2 billion interest rate swaps. We do not intend to call the peak on
the interest rate environment in 2023, but we will continue to take reasonable steps over time to dampen our
asset sensitivity and manage our downside rate risk.
While the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, our current expectations are for short-term interest rates to
rise by 25 basis points, following each of the FOMC meetings in February and March with a rate cut in October.
Based on these assumptions and the balance sheet dynamics I just discussed, we expect net interest income to
grow between 15% and 17% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 13, non-interest income continues to see pressure from market-driven headwinds we've
discussed throughout the year and the customer-friendly fee adjustments we implemented in Q3 of 2022.
In the fourth quarter, modest increases in wealth management fees and BOLI income and stabilization in
mortgage banking were more than offset by reduction in service charges, other fee-based revenue and capital
markets. Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter decrease was a $6 million investment securities gain
recognized in Q3.

As a reminder, we expected to see deposit account fee income moderate beginning in the third quarter of 2022
based on implementation of the OD, NSF changes we announced earlier in the year. These changes were both
proactive and pro customer in nature. When coupled with our relationship focused deposit initiatives, they give us
additional confidence in our ability to strengthen our low-cost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability
profile in 2023. With this in mind, we expect total non-interest income to remain under pressure throughout the
year with compression over 6% to 8% in 2023.
Moving to slide 14, fourth quarter expenses came in at $197 million as we continue to scale up our investments in
people, technology, and business development and advertising. For the full year, expenses grew by 5% versus
2021 in support of our initiatives. Despite this expense growth, our efficiency ratio steadily improved throughout
the year.
On a point-to-point FTE basis, we now decrease our efficiency ratio by approximately 11.38% compared to the
same period last year, reflecting our ability to maintain expense discipline while driving higher revenues. This
point is further underscored by the chart on the lower right, which shows our non-interest expense actually
decreased in 2022 as a percent of assets.
While we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations, we remain committed to keeping
expense growth below revenue growth. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to pursue opportunities to shift
expense from underperforming assets to more productive means, where possible. We expect total non-interest
expense growth of approximately 4% to 6% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 15, we continue to manage capital levels towards our target ranges while supporting growth. We
remain comfortable with our capital levels, given the enhanced profitability we drove throughout 2022. Given
current market conditions and the expectation for short-term interest rates to remain elevated into 2023, we now
expect to maintain TCE in 6.75 to 7.25 range. We expect CET1 to land between 9% and 9.5%.
I will now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 16. We've utilized the
Moody's November 2022 Baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. Moody's baseline forecast
remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes continued Fed rate action, minimal GDP growth and
modest employment deceleration in 2023.
On a dollar basis, our ACLL settled at $351 million at year-end. This figure represents another increase in the
prior quarter, but that build was once again largely driven by significant growth in our loan portfolios. In alignment
with this dynamic, our reserves to loan ratio increased just 2 basis points from 1.2% to 1.22% during the quarter.
Moving to slide 17, our quarterly credit trends remained largely benign during the fourth quarter. Non-performing
assets, non-accrual loans and net charge-offs all decreased from the prior quarter and the same time period a
year ago. The slight increase in delinquencies as compared to recent periods largely reflects a normalization of
our maturing auto book.
Following a $17 million provision build in Q3, we added another $20 million of provision in the fourth quarter. As
mentioned, this provision build was largely a function of loan growth and not a reflection of larger credit quality

concerns within the portfolio. With 2022 representing one of the strongest loan growth years in our history, I'd like
to reiterate that this growth has not come from an expansion of our credit box or overextending ourselves in one
particular area. The recent growth in our loan portfolios has been driven by investments in our core business,
growth of core relationships, and expanding our engagement with familiar customer segments.
Our strong credit foundation in place at Associated today was built over the course of a decade. We have an
experienced team that continues to work hard to bolster this foundation with a disciplined underwriting culture,
improved risk controls and a proactive approach to portfolio management. With that said, we are fully aware of the
warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in our credit discipline with current underwriting reflecting
elevated inflation, supply chain disruption and labor cost to name a few of the economic concerns, as well as
continued interest rate sensitivity analysis across the portfolio. Going forward, we expect any provision
adjustments to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes and other indications of credit
quality.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Pat. Before we move to Q&A, I want to reiterate a couple of points from our discussion this afternoon
on slide 18. First, we remain confident in our ability to drive quality, balanced loan growth throughout the year, but
not at the pace we saw in 2022. With that in mind, we expect total end of period loan growth between 7% and 9%
in 2023. We continued to work on dampening our asset sensitivity, but we expect to continue to benefit from the
rising rate environment in the near-term.
Based on our current forecasts for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed actions, we expect to deliver net
interest income growth of between 15% and 17% in 2023. Lastly, we continue to invest strategically in people and
technology, and expect non-interest expense to grow by 4% to 6% in 2023. As always, we remain disciplined on
expenses as we work to continue delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please proceed
with your question.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, everybody. Good evening.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hey, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting on loan growth. You had great growth in construction this year. What is the visibility look like into
the pipeline heading into 2023? And are there any areas you're focusing on or shying away from as we go
forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, that's a really good question. I'll just speak to the CRE construction that that's a point in time rather than a
trend in my mind. We saw the growth because of the funding up of some of the construction loans. And then a
brief hesitation on some folks to refinance in the permanent market as opposed to new production that we put out
there. We see very little new production, particularly on the industrial side of the equation. The pipelines are
significantly down in commercial real estate. So I think you'll see that category moderate as we go throughout the
year. We expect to have very balanced growth between consumer and commercial, and that's purposeful.
As you know, we have several levers right now so we can start to maximize higher performing portfolios,
portfolios that are more holistic as opposed to single deals, businesses that will de-emphasize third-party
origination already have. We did that in December and that pipelines, frankly flowing through in December and
diminishing as we go into January. So we expect C&I to continue to be solid, but really within our footprint and
with holistic relationships. And we've already seen the evidence of that as we've brought on RMs throughout the
year. That's why we feel like to bring â€“ bringing those RMs on during the year, it has a full-year effect in 2023 and
even stronger focus on ancillary business, including deposits and TM.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then as we look at the â€“ as you look at margin and spread income, I guess, where do you â€“ where
could we see margin sort of peaking out, peaking with some of the changes you took? And then just to confirm is
the NII growth target 7%, 9%, is that full-year 2023 over full-year 2022 or is that from annualized fourth quarter
levels?

Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Jared, this is Derek. It's â€“ those are full-year numbers. And so in our guidance on NII, it's based on the yield curve
assumptions we made and the loan growth that we outlined in terms of expectations. So we're not giving
guidance on where we're calling the peak on rates. We sort of talked about that. I talked about that in the script.
When we saw â€“ when we â€“ as we went into this year and looked at all the planned â€“ the rate moves, even while
we were planning in December and even in the first week of January, I think it's pretty dangerous to try and call
that. What we're really anchored on are the fundamentals they're going to drive durable margin. We came into this
very asset sensitive. We are going to remain asset sensitive, but we are taking some of that asset sensitivity
down, which we talk a little bit about with our hedging.
But we also are putting a stake in the ground with the outperformance on deposit growth. And you saw that this
year. You put into â€“ that into perspective with the initiatives we put in place that we've outlined on slide 8, many of
which have year-over-year impacts on our ability to generate deposit growth beyond just interest rates. Then you
have new initiatives that will have a full-year impact this year going out, and then you start to fill in the blanks
behind that other kind of funding that we might need to support that level of loan growth. We're still committed to
our 95% loan to deposit ratio, and we still expect our wholesale funding to be below what we had historically
during the last time we had rising rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. But to get to the NII guide, I guess that implies a pretty significant step down in margin as we â€“ as you go
through the year is [ph] not (30:54) the right way to be looking at that, even though you're still asset sensitive and
you're still expecting a little bit of rate moves up earlier on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think what year-over-year. It's [ph] not (31:08) a full-year basis, it's a step up. I think when you look at
sequential quarter, you're still trying to â€“ everybody's trying to figure out where is your peak quarter. And we're not
making that call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then on capital, should we expect that you could be more active in capital management to
potentially get to the lower end of that range? Or is that just a function of the natural movement of the balance
sheet and we shouldn't really be expecting a buyback or any significant change to capital return strategies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We're not looking to change our capital return strategies. There's still dividend and organic growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. I'll step back. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to also ask about sort of NII and trajectory there.
So I guess that just in looking at the guidance suggests that the quarterly average of NII for the full-year 2023 will
be about $10 million a quarter less than what we did in the fourth quarter, [ph] now granted (32:28) fourth quarter
was just an extraordinarily strong number. But maybe do you have, Derek, a sense for how NII in dollar terms
would project that throughout the year? In other words, can we â€“ would we stay high for, say, the first half of the
year as long as the Fed is still raising rates and we get that benefit and then there's a taper off or was there
anything in the fourth quarter that would have kind of elevated it? And then we maybe step down, but have a
steadier dollar average throughout the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I don't â€“ again, I don't think I'm going to be that specific. I think we recognized that deposit betas are
catching up, when exactly they, which quarter they catch up and you see some of that quarterly compression, I
don't â€“ again, I don't think we have that called. So I think we're more comfortable giving the full-year guidance and
with the options we've got, we think we can get to that number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. And then just given some of the hedging actions that you've taken or took in the second
half of the year, do you have sort of a sense where like maybe what might represent a floor for the margin once it
does begin to taper off by any chance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, we don't. I think you can back into some scenarios using the â€“ our asset sensitivity that we have there. If you
do some â€“ a little bit of [ph] cowboy (33:59) math, you know that a 25-basis-point shock might impact you $7.5
million, $7 million on a full-year basis. And you can see we've been managing that down. It's a combination of the
swaps and the evolution of the portfolio. I think that's as far as I'd go with that. The â€“ I think it's tough to call floor.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
One of the things that we â€“ that everybody's faced with, and I know everybody on the call is interested in, is how
do you continue with the hedging strategy, with the shape of the yield curve? And so if your natural balance sheet
is offering you protection or is with some of the growth we've got in the auto book, then you might start thinking
about swaps or floors. But we're not at that point yet. And we're still monitoring each quarter. And we like the
progress we're making, and we want to stay...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe another stab at the NII from a different point of view. But just looking at the balance sheet, would you say
you're at the point with excess liquidity now where you expect that the balance sheet growth to more or less
matched loan growth at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So the way I'd characterize it, I mean, that's a shorthand I haven't done that view. We are going to â€“ we
have bottomed out on securities and as a percent of fixed assets. So there is a component of our funding plan
and deposit growth that includes supporting investments and securities. So it probably gets you closer to what
you're talking about.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. And then, I appreciate your comment on expecting positive operating leverage in
2023. Is there any kind of environment from a rate perspective that would restrict that â€“ the ability to achieve that?
Or you feel pretty comfortable with that guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, look, you know that the rate question, the yield question, the impact in the market is being asked on almost
every call. And just there are obvious reasons, and that's because there's a lot of contradictory information out
there to understand what the future might be. With regards to what we see in our portfolio, the tailwind that we
have from the growth that we've already experienced in 2022, heading into 2023, the initiatives that we have that
show that we're able to fund a little bit, we've been able to fund on the deposit side a little bit ahead of what the
marketplace is, our ability to shift expenses from a low return area to a higher return area, all those things at this
stage give us confidence in what our forecast is.
The economy doesn't seem to be falling down quickly in our mind, and there could be a slow roll towards that. We
also see pipelines and have conversations about automation and what that can mean on the loan demand side.
And we have a lot of levers there. That's really choosing which levers we want to go forward with. But we believe
those exist. Those will match largely what our deposit funding is, and that is our expectation. And the other point
that I'll make is, and I know we're talking about 2023, but we're talking about actions we're taking as a company to
structurally change how we fund our balance sheet over time. So that starts to give you more and more
confidence that we have opportunity for improvement as we drive those core deposits, that means that you over
time lessen the wholesale funding.
So the answer â€“ the short answer is yes, we have as much confidence since we can have in an uncertain world
on what will happen, because we have many tactics and strategies, both on the loan side, the deposit side, but
also where we invest our capital, where invest our money on people. And also where we invest in digital versus
shift in the digital spend into â€“ from the â€“ shifting to digital spend from physical spend. So taking all those things
together in the environment we're in, we today have a confidence level in the 2023 forecast.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I appreciate all the color, Andy. Just lastly, on the expense guide, it came in below actually what I was looking for.
Now, just curious if â€“ in terms of the pace of expense growth through the year, if there's anything that we need to
keep in mind or if it's just, you know, you're considering rather steady growth through the year. Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
No. The reason that we feel confident in this space is because we've taken an approach, frankly, since I've been
here, which is we look very, very strongly at the expenses that we have and say, are we spending in the right
place? Let's start with that and then we cut expenses in those areas going into the year we've targeted in the first
year, taking out I think is roughly $10 million. And we have a similar approach going into the year on what do we
do in our physical branches, what are we doing in third-party origination, which has less â€“ typically less margin
and return on it? Then we took action with our staffing and as we brought that [ph] lever (40:02) down. So it's not
just a function of investing in new areas, it's also simultaneously taking the expense off the table in areas that
cannot yield as much to us on the long-term. So when we say 4% to 6% is because we are taking actions
proactively to cut expenses before we grow expenses. As long as the increase in expense leads to an increase in
revenue, we will continue on that path. But we will ask the team also, if it doesn't, where do we proactively slow
down the investment and that exercise is already a course of business for our team.
So to answer your question, I like the discipline, an environment where we've been able to grow revenue. I very
much like the discipline that we've had with regards to expenses. We also happen to bring in a CFO that has
years and years of experience as the Head of FP&A. I will tell you that's not on accident. Bringing discipline to
execution is very important, not often talked about, but incredibly important when you're trying to balance growth
and bring in that discipline towards expense management. So I feel quite good about the 4% to 6% range. And I
will tell you, we're not immune from the issues that everybody has, which is consistently looking at different areas
of your business and knowing that we're competing for talent. So we have factored in increases that we have
already had to make or are going to make with regards to talent, talent in key areas to retain them.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. In prior presentations, you provided the 2023 loan growth outlook by those three
categories, commercial down to auto finance. So I guess my question is kind of in an ideal world, what bucket
would you like to grow and how would you like that that mix of growth to be in 2023, and is auto finance kind of
the filler, so to speak, because to allow you to hit that target, given just some of the lower returns that we hear in
the marketplace?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's a great call out, Terry. And what I would say is we have a lot of levers and we want to see where the
year is going as opposed to going in the middle of the year and say, we're going to go hard in this asset class only
14


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
to find out that maybe that is not the area offering the best returns. And so we look very closely at our mortgage
business, now our mortgage business, in production, is off 80% so far versus the prior January. So how do I want
to forecast that out in a year where we're seeing pay downs at historic lows and we're still seeing that growth? So
we're trying to pull these levers through, but what we know is we have the ability to manage what our loan growth
number is because we've taken action with quality people and quality segments and then we're going to look at
what the returns in those areas are.
So what I'd give is guidance during this period, I'll also say asset-based lending and equipment finance, while
they're new businesses to us, they're middle market, that is middle market lending all day long. So to call those
out at this point, we feel like it's part of our business. It's how we're selling, it's integrated into our process. Then
we'll look at the consumer side and try to create balanced growth between that residential. And then pick up the
slack with our auto lending, I'm not sure I'd call it a filler product, and I'm certain our division would not really like
that as the label. I would say we have professionals that look for prime paper that have low risk to them in a high
risk â€“ higher risk potentially environment. So I like the position we're in there.
So I'd finish that commentary by saying we have optionality within where we are. Our goal over time is to drive
margin. We think we have an opportunity. We look at that very closely in the industry and we see what that mix
shift can be. So the idea is that we can drive higher yielding assets over time. But for 2023, what I would like to do
is drive balanced growth. We are not the auto lending company. We are a company that can choose between
consumer and commercial, and try to balance the growth between those two while maximizing the areas on
margins. So that's a little bit of why we haven't broken that out going to the year. It's also the reason that I have
confidence that we can hit some of our projections.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I mean, what do you say to investors who are concerned with what
they may feel is late cycle loan growth and how those loans may perform in a downturn? When I look at page 4,
that right-hand category, there's just been significant growth for a bank of your size in commercial and CRE and
construction and even auto finance, or especially auto finance. What's the â€“ what's your response?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I would say if you look at 12 months, you probably started too late. And what I would say is we worked on
fundamentally changing the balance sheet to de-risk in over a decade. And specifically, I could call out, for
instance, our residential real estate portfolio. We're oversized in residential real estate, but we're oversized in a
portfolio that is prime and super-prime in a market that doesn't have large fluctuations up and down. So
inherently, our balance sheet is less risky in our opinion going into that. And that has seen some growth.
When we look at auto and coin that out specifically, it is the oldest new business I've ever experienced. And by
that I mean we have people that joined us with decades of experience across the board in that space. Not only do
they have decades of experience, we also brought the data, the historical data, to understand what the â€“ how the
portfolio operates, so we know how that operates. Then on top of that, we went into prime and super-prime. And
I'll specifically say to the investors that by traditional standards, 97% of that book is prime and super-prime.
If we take a scorecard approach, which takes a lot of other factors and we think is a better way to look at it, it's
99% of our portfolio, and we know that because we can check that against historical data. So those would be the
things that I would say with regards to what the portfolio is. The next thing I'd say is we did not expand our credit
box anywhere. In fact, we've tightened up our credit box as we've seen the world change. So we've tightened that
15


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
up on commercial real estate underwriting. We've tightened that up on commercial underwriting, and we already
had a pretty conservative approach. So we've added balances and areas that we know quite well. I get a lot of
passion on this. I'm looking across the table at our Chief Risk â€“ Chief Credit Risk Officer. I think maybe he should
make a final comment on this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, I would agree with everything you said. We did not change our credit box relative to the growth you've seen.
And we are continuing to look at, like, as Andy said, what's going on in the marketplace, whether that's interest
rate adjustments, whether it's sizing, whether it's underwriting to an exit. So all that stuff is kind of evolves in
relative to the marketplace. And what it's also done is the growth you're seeing again, it kind of reflects the core
client that we've been focusing on. So we didn't stretch to add in a new vertical. We didn't stretch to add in some
new geography or anything like that. So we feel we're comfortable with the core focus we had coupled with the
adjustments we're making to reflect what's going on in the economy.

Just a quick follow-up on that for you, Pat. On slide 17, you mentioned some normalization driving the
delinquencies up. And I know these are small numbers, but what do you expect that to look like in a couple of
quarters just so we're not surprised by that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think it's going to revert back to kind of the pre-pandemic numbers, how long that takes, a year ago we were we
thought maybe we'd be there by now, but it's not. I think, again, as we've mentioned, the portfolio continues to
outperform. We're seeing the loan book, the auto â€“ indirect auto book is a little over a year now. So we're kind of
reaching some normalization there. But really, the rest of some of the consumer delinquencies that we saw this
quarter are really small and we haven't really seen a significant trends. So when we get back to say, 2018, 2019
numbers is still to be determined.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
But that helps. I was just going to ask about the delinquencies as well. Non-financial questions for you, Andy, the
brand campaign you talked about. What is the message on that and what do you think needs to refreshed or
emphasized in terms of messaging?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I sure hate to spoil it for you, Jon. I feel like I'm going to email those commercials to you, though, as we're
launching. But what I will say, the interesting part to me is we brought in a new Chief Marketing and Product
Officer and his expertise is in customer research. And so when you launch something that's about the brand, first
you want to know what you're about, but then you also want to know what your customers are about. And so we
are going to combine what the messaging is that's kind of true to us and what we do. But it's also going to be
what's in it for me. And as we think about marrying a marketing message, we also think about our product
execution. So we will â€“ the significance of the products that we're going to launch in the second, third and fourth
quarter should marry up with that brand message and it does, that's a big deal.
And then when you think about the triumvirate, you think about the new branding, you think about the product,
and then you think about digital. Because at the end of the day, you're driving them to your digital platform and
you need to be relevant. And the final thing I'll say on that is you want to make sure you're relevant, particularly to
the people that are switching banks, and those are typically people that are 40 years old and under. So that is
right in the sweet spot of what we're doing in digital. It's right in the sweet spot of the ease of use and satisfaction
we are seeing from our digital account opening. It will be consistent with the message and it will also be with
those folks in that range have told us are important from a product standpoint. So it's been a heck of a lot of work
going into all of that and we've been on that path for more than 12 months, even before our new product and
marketing executive came on board. But it's coming together nicely. So I'm making a note to myself. Email Jon of
all the commercials.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay. And then just a couple more clean-ups. Just back on Terry's question on slide 5 on auto. I understand what
you're saying there. But do you expect auto to grow very materially from here? You've kind of achieved what you
wanted to get in terms of some of the portfolio diversification.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I would say that we have the option to grow it. I would say that we have to look at our mortgage portfolio that was
initially set up as a natural hedge to a decreasing [ph] mortgage emphasis (52:00). And we're seeing right now
why that's important. And so we believe that it will have growth in 2023. The exact number on that will be
dependent upon what our overall position is, what the other categories do, what mortgage specifically does, what
we can fund in liquidity as well. So a little bit too early to put a finer point on that, which is why we really, I've kind
of message that it's more of a balanced growth between commercial and consumer.
