Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming everyone to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. In the third
quarter, we continued to execute well through a challenging operating environment. Compared to the prior year,
revenue grew 7%, as the elimination of fee waivers and the favorable impact from higher interest rates more than
offset the significant headwinds from weaker equity in fixed income markets, asset outflows, and unfavorable
currency movements.
Expense growth of 9% reflected inflationary impacts across our cost base, particularly within our compensation
and equipment and software lines. EPS was flat, and we generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%.
New business activity in Wealth Management was encouraging, and we continue to engage actively with new and
existing clients.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
In asset management, weak markets and institutional cash outflows reduced assets under management, yet we
saw continued growth in our alternatives, tax-advantaged equity, and ETF complex. And within Asset Servicing,
we continued to win new mandates, and our backlog of new clients that haven't yet been onboarded has
expanded meaningfully and is expected to transition over the coming quarters.
In closing, we remain well-positioned to navigate the current macroeconomic and market uncertainty from a
position of strength. Our new business pipeline remains robust, and our capital position continues to be strong. In
a slowing growth environment, we've also begun prudently tightening our expense controls and focusing on
realizing productivity benefits from the investments we've made over the past several years.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter net
income of $394.8 million. Earnings per share were $1.80, and our return on average common equity was 14.9%.
Results for the quarter included a $17 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense
category. Also, recall that in the first quarter of this year, we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain
fees, which will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons as noted on this page.
Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 7% and
expenses increased 9%. Net income was flat. In a sequential comparison, revenue was down 1% and expenses
were up 1%, while net income was also flat. Return on average common equity was 14.9% for the quarter, up
from 13.7% a year ago and down from 15.7% in the prior quarter.
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Year-over-year, unfavorable currency
translation impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Trust, investment, and other servicing
fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were down 3% from last year
and down 6% sequentially. All other remaining non-interest income declined 8% from the prior year and 2% from
the prior quarter. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $525 million and was up 47%
from a year ago and 12% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Asset Servicing business, fees
totaled $603 million and were down 4% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Within Asset Servicing,
custody and fund administration fees were $407 million, down 12% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.
Custody and fund administration fees decreased sequentially primarily due to unfavorable markets, unfavorable
currency translation, and lower transaction volumes.
Custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to unfavorable
currency translation and unfavorable markets, partially offset by new business. Assets under custody and
administration for Asset Servicing clients were $12 trillion at quarter-end, down 19% year-over-year, and down
7% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by unfavorable markets
and currency translation.
Investment management fees within Asset Servicing were $136 million, up 20% year-over-year and down 8%
sequentially. Investment management fees decreased sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable markets and

asset outflows. Investment management fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower money
market fund fee waivers and the accounting reclassification previously discussed, partially offset by asset outflows
and unfavorable markets.
Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $873.7 billion, down 25% year-over-year and down
8% sequentially. Both declines were driven by asset outflows, weaker equity and fixed income markets, and
unfavorable currency translation.
Moving to our Wealth Management business; trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $475.5 million,
down 1% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year
declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts, partially offset by the elimination of money market
fund fee waivers. Sequentially, the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets.
Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business,
partially offset by unfavorable markets. Sequential decrease was mainly related to unfavorable markets. Assets
under management for our Wealth Management clients were $336 billion at quarter-end. It's down 10% year-over-
year and down 5% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven primarily
by unfavorable markets.
Moving to page 6, net interest income was $525.3 million in the quarter and was up 47% from the prior year.
Earning assets averaged $132 billion in the quarter, down 8% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $118
billion and were down 9% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $41 billion and were up 8%
compared to the prior year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 12%. Average earning assets declined 6%. Average
deposits declined 8%, while average loan balances were up 2%. The net interest margin was 1.58% in the
quarter, up 60 basis points from a year ago and up 23 basis points from the prior quarter. The prior-year quarter
increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates and favorable balance sheet mix shift. The sequential
increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.2 billion in the quarter, 9% higher than the prior year and 1% higher than
the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, expense growth benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to
currency translation. The current quarter's expenses included a $17 million pension settlement charge within the
employee benefits category. This compares to similar charges in the prior-year quarter of $6.9 million and $20.3
million in the prior-period quarter. Also included in the current quarter is the impact of the previously mentioned
accounting reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $9.4 million compared to the prior year.
Compensation expense was up 12% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year
growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense, in part due to inflationary pressures, partially offset by
favorable currency translation. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher salary expense, partially offset
by lower incentives and favorable currency translation.
Outside services expense was $221 million and was up 5% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. The year-
over-year increase is primarily driven by higher consulting and technical service costs, partially offset by lower
third-party advisory fees. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher technical services and consulting
costs. Equipment and software expense of $212 million was up 15% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially.
The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in

technology, as well as inflationary pressures and higher amortization. The sequential increase is primarily due to
higher software amortization expense.
Occupancy expense at $51 million was down 5% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. The other operating
expense of $82 million was up 1% from one year ago and down 9% sequentially. The sequential decline is
primarily due to lower miscellaneous expenses in the current period.
Turning to page 8, our capital ratios remain strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.1% under the
standardized approach, down from the prior quarter's 10.5%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio is 7%, up from 6.7% in the
prior quarter. An increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a primary
factor in this quarter's change in capital ratios.
Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the current quarter was a loss of $1.8 billion, with the
loss from the third quarter totaling approximately $300 million. As previously announced, in the third quarter, we
increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 7%, or $0.05 a share, to $0.75 per share. During the quarter,
we returned $159.5 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158.4 million and share
repurchases of $1.1 million.
The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance
sheet to both weather the uncertain economic conditions and to support our clients' needs. We approach the end
of the year on solid footing, and remain well-positioned to serve our clients and communities while generating
long-term value to our shareholders.
And with that, Victor, please open the line for questions.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I did want to just dig in a little bit on the expense side. And when I listen and look at the results, there's some
areas where it feels like maybe the inflation is impacting a little bit. I know you're being very disciplined in how
you're investing, but I just wanted to make sure I understand how you're thinking about managing the expense
base as we go through this inflationary environment. And is there an opportunity to pull back on some of the
consulting side, professional services side; or should we anticipate that the kind of rate change we're seeing in
this quarter should persist? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, let me start with a direct answer to the question. And, yes, there are things we can do and we've been
focused on to address expense growth. And so, let me – predominantly, even within this period, in mid-
September, we announced internally some additional expense controls. We always have those in place, but we
meaningfully ramped up expense controls, particularly around hiring. That's obviously the largest component of
where we see expense increases. That's our largest line.
And so, that will lead us to have just a higher bar on where we have increases in expenses, particularly from a
hiring perspective. That's not to say that we are going to stop investing in the things [indiscernible] (00:15:43) that
we're not going to continue investing in the things around technology and other areas where we know we've had
important investments to take place. But at the same time, we do see an opportunity for us to raise that bar to try
and tamp down the growth that we've seen in expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just separately, as I'm thinking through the growth profile here, you've got some nice exposure to
international. At the same time, we've got the strong dollar weighing on the results to a certain extent. Maybe you
could help us think through the impact of the dollar. And if we excluded that, how results would have looked this
quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well at a super high level, the company has a very natural hedge from a currency perspective. And so, this
quarter it was very roughly, call it, 200, 300 basis points in impact from both the revenue side and the expense
side. And so, the dollar does play in, but it plays on both the revenue and the expense side.
The other impact that's not as symmetrical is how the dollar plays – is how currency plays in more from an asset
level perspective. That played into asset level movements in both assets under custody as well as assets under
management. And something people won't typically think about, it even played in on the deposit decline. And
when you think about the movement we've had, and we can talk about that in more detail, but even the deposits
had a downward move in value of about $1.5 billion in aggregate across all currencies.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And one moment for next question. And our next question will come from the line of
Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Oh. Hey, guys. Good morning. Sorry, I didn't catch my name there. So, a couple of questions. I guess, one,
obviously deposit outflows sounds like picked up in September relative to sort of the last update that we heard
from you guys. At the Barclays conference, I think you said around $120 billion. Came in a little bit lower. But the
mix in particular, I think, was a little bit more pronounced, too, with non-interest-bearing declining substantially.
So, maybe just an update on sort of how the quarter's progressed, but also more importantly, where the deposits
stand today and the mix, non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing, as well as any of your sort of updated
thoughts on where the deposit levels could ultimately trough out. It looks like the non-interest-bearing piece is
getting pretty close to the kind of pre-COVID levels, but curious to get your thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, first of all, on the deposit levels and where they were relative to our expectation, actually came in really
close, particularly given what we mentioned earlier in that the currency effect of the non-USD. And so, where they
landed at the quarter – where they averaged actually was pretty close.
And I mentioned that because as we get to the next quarter, I think we are – it's very difficult to predict in general.
And so – but let me hit mix first. So, you're right, non-interest-bearing dropped significantly during the quarter, and
that's something we expect to happen. A lot of our financial services clients that use our balance sheet are often
in non-interest-bearing accounts, but as rates rise off of zero, they have the opportunity to move into interest-
bearing accounts; and they did that.
A lot of the – a very high percentage of the accounts that are eligible to do that have done so at this point, which
gets exactly to your point, Alex, that we're kind of at, in some ways, those pre-COVID levels. That's not to say we
won't see additional movements there, but we think certainly a lot of it has already taken place.
And then the third part of your question of where do we see things today; just looking at the first two weeks of the
quarter, deposits behaved about what we would anticipate. They tend to come down a little bit at this point into
the quarter. And so, we're in that kind of $110 billion to $115 billion. What we expect to happen between now and
the end of the quarter is an interesting dynamic. There's two forces working against each other.
One is with quantitative tightening and the yield curve being higher and clients across the board continuing to look
at how they can allocate nonoperational but more investment cash, that continues to put a downward pressure.

But in the short run, there's an offset to that; there's an upward pressure in the seasonality that we've seen in
fourth quarter, which tends to have more of an upward pressure.
And so, it's difficult to see which one of those is going to have stronger influences, but best guess is you might call
it flat from here. And so that $110 billion, $115 billion level, but appreciating that there's big forces moving against
each other.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for that. Appreciate the color. And I guess speaking of institutions looking to earn a little bit extra
yield on their cash, when I look at Northern's securities portfolio, you guys are yielding, I think, about 1.8%, and
the market rates there are probably closer to 4%, maybe a little higher. Now, geographically, it could be different
with the mix, but obviously an attractive opportunity to reprice there.
I guess, with AOCI losses already running through your capital, any appetite to sell down, I guess, some of the
lower-yielding securities without necessarily changing the profile of fixed versus floating, and kind of keeping the
overall duration of the portfolio in a similar place? But I guess crystallizing some of the losses but picking up
incremental [ph] NII (00:22:00) in the current environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, we talk about it a lot. And I think an important dynamic for everyone to know, and I know you
appreciate this 100%, is that the economics of taking the loss, reinvesting that lower amount at the higher yield,
the efficiency of markets are just telling you that, over time, the impact of that should be relatively equal.
Now, the second component though is that there may be other reasons to do that. You might be looking to – you
might have a view that the yield curve is going to change significantly. You might want to handle other ratios by
doing that. And so it's not to say that we wouldn't do it, but it's just to say that the quick trade of take the – realize
the loss, invest at a higher rate, it's not as easy and it's not as beneficial. We care about just the long-term value
of what the securities portfolio is yielding, not just the NII or NIM in the short run.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, much for my iPad. So, look, are the tailwinds done? Jason, you correctly predicted the NIM going back to the
levels of 2019. Elimination of fee waivers, those are good. On the other hand, I guess you still have some
tailwinds from the uninstalled business which really isn't clear why that's so much higher. Were there delays or
are you just winning business?
On the other hand, you have the headwinds from the lower stock markets. Is that going to continue or is that
mostly in the numbers now? So, if you can help me with the tailwinds and the headwind question. And the reason
I ask that is because you got those tailwinds and you still had negative operating leverage, so it's – are you just a
hostage to your business model or can you have revenues grow faster than expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, yeah. So, a couple of things in there. Let me try to hit them, but certainly ask me to clarify if I don't get all of
them. One, on rates, is it done? The answer is no. We still have upward movement. And in fact, we looked just

within the quarter at the month, and September was just a tiny bit above 1.60%. And so, we got into that level.
And even at this point, betas will be much higher, but won't be 100%. And so, we'll get an incremental lift. And
then the third dynamic of that is that, as the securities portfolio is repricing, just Alex's question earlier, it takes
time, but we have an opportunity to reinvest at these higher rates; so, not done yet.
Second, on the pipeline of business, that has taken longer to come in. Some of the opportunities we have in Asset
Servicing, in particular in the won-not-onboarded category, are very big and they're chunky. And those just take
longer, and the volatility in the markets we think has just made clients just want to make sure that everything is
lined up properly. And so, that won-not-onboarded category is significantly higher than it is on average, but we're
confident about it coming through.
And then the stock market dynamic, you're right. Usually, we talk about operating leverage, and the numbers are
just much smaller. It's, can we get the expense growth plus a little bit of market lift to match and – but in this
environment, the macro environment is just dominating what's happening to both expense growth and revenue
growth.
And so, I've been saying all year, we cannot – there are false positives in the operating leverage. There are false
negatives in the fee operating leverage. And this is a year where we have to just understand that those numbers
are dominated by the macro factor. It's not typical. It doesn't change our long-term financial model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And on the won-not-onboarded category, can you size that to some degree, and give us some sense of timing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, I can give a sense of timing, which is it's actually – it's more back half of 2023 that we're scheduling some
of this stuff coming in play. And that seems a long way away, but it's just – that's us making sure and working very
closely with clients, make sure everything is lined up properly. And from a sizing perspective, we don't tend to give
a number on that. But what I can tell you is that it's meaningfully higher than – that aggregate is meaningfully
higher than what it has been historically. And pipeline – and then the outside of the won-not-funded, the Asset
Servicing business will tell you that the pipeline activity is also very high.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Morning, Jason. Hey, follow-up on that organic growth side. Can you just talk about the wealth business?
And if you could also try to separate the markets from just where organic growth is there, and any updates in
terms of, is there same type of hold back at all in terms of customers moving, coming over, bringing assets over,
given the environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Actually, I'm really glad you asked that because the wealth businesses, the journey is very different. The
wealth business, the organic – the growth there was higher first half of the year. And the business is still doing
well, but they don't feel – but the won-not-funded is not as strong relative to history as the Asset Servicing
business. Now, both of those client channels will tell you importantly their win rates in the market are very
attractive, and they are very consistent with what they have been historically.
And so, it's just about, for wealth, their view is equity markets are lower, less capital markets activity, and it's put
just less money in motion. And so year-to-date, organic growth in wealth has been in line with historical levels:
first half strong, frankly higher than normal; second half looks lighter, but money in motion is down. Fewer IPOs,
fewer liquidity events, but importantly their sense is their win rate in the market is consistent with what it has been
historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then if I can just ask one follow-up to Alex's question. So, if there's more room to go on the NIM, the
challenge is overcoming the magnitude of that size decline in the balance sheet. So, how far out is your line of
sight? I know you're not going to give specific guidance, but in terms of your NII growth being able to continue
post the third quarter result.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
No. I mean, the way you're framing the algorithm is right. It's just we – rates are – it's going to start to flatten out,
and our betas this coming quarter, we're anticipating betas of 80% in this coming quarter. And so, the benefits are
just flattening out. But, as rates go higher, we're still getting a benefit, and the repricing of the securities portfolio is
a positive lag effect to that, effectively.
Now, all that said, the volume levels matter a lot as well. And just as rates were increasing, we talked about the
importance of loans. That's where the real yield is. But we can't ignore the fact that when volumes are coming
down, it puts pressure on the securities portfolio and on money market assets, which has an impact less on NIM
but more on NII.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan
Hawken from UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Brennan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, hey, Jason. I'm glad you said good morning because my line cut out when you said my name. Okay. I'd love
to ask a question about what you're seeing here so far. Number one, just to clarify, the $110 billion to $115 billion,
that's kind of like the range you've been seeing in deposits quarter-to-date, right? And assuming that's the case
and, as you said, hard to predict. But if we do end up seeing some continued pressure on the deposit side, should
we expect that wholesale funding line to plug the gap to the extent that AFS securities cannot come down quick
enough, should we think that, that line is going to continue to grow if the deposits remain under pressure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You're right in that that's – we think that's the last fulfillment mechanism on the balance sheet and we don't
use that. There's no strategic initiative there to use it, but it does in the short run – in the short run, act as the
fulfillment mechanism depending on what's happening. And the good news is, there's a positive carry on that and
rates are decent. So it helps NII, but we don't use it as a way to push and lever the balance sheet more than we
need to. We use it as effectively just a fulfillment mechanism.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Right. So that's sort of the output to the extent that you don't have a – that you need to plug. That makes
sense. And then when we think about non-operating deposits, where do we stand in total for non-operating versus
where we were at the peak of the last rate hiking cycle? Have we retraced that decline?
And you spoke to the shifting of non-operating from non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing. I'm guessing that's
what's driving up the betas. What kind of magnitude impact does that – because I'm guessing the non-op is a
more demanding customer base on the beta side. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it is. It is, for sure. And there's actually another layer within there, which we've talked about a little bit. So it's
good for us to – it's fine for you to continue asking more detail on it. But even within the non-operational, there's
financial and nonfinancial. And the financial nonoperational are the areas where there's the highest rate
sensitivity; and, frankly, it's also the area we have to have the highest amount of runoff anticipation.

And therefore, it's the area where we do the shortest and least-yielding investing on the other side of it. And so
that – and you're right. That component, it continues to be the higher runoff in terms of volume level so far. So if I
look at the numbers, it is – across all the categories we look at, it's the single highest decline on a percentage
basis even this quarter.
And that said, there's declines in other areas as well. And so even within the operational base was down, I'll call it
5% to 10%, and – but that's more that client base looking at different investment options and saying I might have
– with the yield curve at and flat at zero, might not have been looking to ladder in treasury securities or look at an
active fixed income portfolio, but now they're very much looking to do that as they talk to their advisors. And so,
very different dynamics at play.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Great. Just, first, one clarification on that deposit beta of 80% that you just mentioned, Jason. That's an
incremental beta as opposed to, say, an absolute level that you'd be out in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I want to make sure I understand. So, yes, as we think about incremental rate changes...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

...that's the beta that we're experiencing on those incremental changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Perfect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then maybe just on expenses, I guess one question just around the seasonality expectations, because you
do have some of the cost controls in place that you mentioned that you initiated in September. So, how should we
think about the typical seasonal lift in outside services, in equipment and software, for example, that we usually
see? And then also short-term, just the pension charges, should we think of that as more recurring or really, sort
of, you're kind of done with that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I'll hit the first one just on expenses. And then Lauren is here and can also talk on the pension settlement
accounting issues. So, on expenses, we've mentioned that depreciation is higher. And so, in equipment and
software, in particular, we're anticipating another lift in fourth quarter similar to what we had in third quarter. And
despite the expense actions we're taking, part of that is just baked into the our base right now, particularly from a
depreciation and amortization perspective.
That said, we'll be looking hard at expenses even within that line item. But we've also talked about the importance
of us investing in technology. But we'll see that similar lift going into fourth quarter. And then consulting is without
a doubt one of the key areas where we're looking very hard to make sure that anything that comes on at this point
is critical, and that we're handling that with a very high bar of what we're doing. But it's very correlated, in many
instances as well, to what we're doing from equipment and software perspective.
With that, Lauren, you want to talk on pension for a second?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Lauren E. Allnutt A
Executive Vice President & Controller, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So as we think about pension, we definitely would expect to see that recur in the fourth quarter. The fact
that we have triggered this accounting mechanism, the settlement accounting, does mean that our run rate of
pension expense in the current year is lower, but we will expect to see that in the fourth quarter. It is difficult to
predict whether that's something that we would expect to see going forward into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one more in there on expenses in terms of the onboarding of the
clients. Do you also expect – typically we see expenses in advance of that, particularly if they're more larger,
complex assignments in Asset Servicing. Is that a similar dynamic that we may see either now or in the first half of
next year in advance of the onboarding of these clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
This is Mike. I would say we've already experienced some of that. So as Jason has mention, some of these
transitions just are taking longer for a number of reasons. I think part of it, too, is that if you look at the pipeline
right now on the Asset Servicing side, it's a high proportion of asset managers. And those mandates just tend to
take longer to transition in for asset owners. And so we've been already – have been at work in doing that and
incurring some of the expenses that go with it. And then, as you point out, as those start to transition in, it kind of
normalizes into the rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q

Morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello there. So I guess in some way you're a bit of a microcosm of the inflation issue we have in the market. So
my question on the expense side is, is head count up 11%, comp up like 12%, and that's half the expense dollars.
So, is it fair for me to assume that we could be more careful going forward, but this higher level of dollars on
employee comp and benefits is probably going to be with us for a while, just like the market fears overall? In other
words, you can't take comp away that you just gave?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yeah, Glenn. I think that's true in general. Just to expand on that, I would say that, for us at least, we've gone
through a time period here with inflation, but also tremendous competition for the best talent. And as you know,
that's where we look – or one of the ways we look to differentiate ourselves. So it's very important to us to make
sure that we were retaining the best talent and also attracting new talent as well. And so, yes, we've had that
increase in comp that has been a part of the run rate going forward.
The question is, what happens to the rate of growth going forward. We're looking at that very carefully, I would
say, but we need to be competitive on that front. And then the other part, as Jason mentioned, we've added a
number of additional partners, employees for us. And that's something which was very appropriate as we invest in
taking care of our clients, invest in technology, invest in resiliency. So, all makes sense. We just, going forward,
have to be really, really focused on making sure that we're only adding for very critical roles so that, that growth
rate of head count is appropriate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I hear you're not alone there. One question on – when markets are going up a lot like they used to, you would
have plenty of clients that would have either fee ceilings or fee caps such that fees just don't scale up as markets
go up. My question is, does it work that way in reverse? Markets fallen like 22% this year. Do we have any
protection on the way down whereas maybe fees might not drop as much as markets would imply going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
So, a couple of thoughts there. One, even within the contracts that are asset based, a lot of the components of
them are flat. And so, as you see increases and decreases, the fee rates don't move 100% in the same
magnitude. And, secondly, outside of that, there are certain transactions that are charged for on a per unit basis.
And so, that in of itself adds a layer. That's uncorrelated in many ways to the level of assets. And even this
quarter, one of the things we experienced as we think about organic growth, in particular in the Asset Servicing
business, that was another dynamic, transaction volumes were down.
And that may have had some correlation with markets being down, but we actually think it was more correlated to
just the volatility where a lot of the managers – the asset manager clients we have were doing less because of the
particularly currency volatility. And so, different dynamics at work. But without a doubt, trustees won't move 100%
in line with markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. Maybe one last one in Wealth Management. Big difference in the AUM change year-on-year, down 10%,
versus down 25% for Asset Servicing. I'm assuming that's mostly mix, and Wealth Management clients holding
20-something percent in cash. So, I wonder if you could, a, confirm that; and, b, talk about what wealth clients are
now doing with all that cash.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, from a wealth perspective, the clients may take a different approach in saying that they're thinking about
investing and they might – it's more of an asset class change for them, an asset allocation change by class. In the
institutional market, those clients will often think differently and they might be moving between providers, they
might be moving – and maybe got more options to think about what their existing option sets are.

I will say in general, if you think about deposits and the money market funds combined, the movements tend to
not be as extreme. And deposits might be a better place to look at that. They've actually just been flatter. And so,
the wealth clients just tend to be – ironically, we all think about that component of the market maybe being more –
moving around more, but I think it's the nature of our specific clients that they tend to be – to move less and just
be more patient through cycles.

Morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Jason. Digging a little deeper into the decline year-over-year of assets under
custody/administration. You touched on it in your prepared remarks. Can you share with us how it breaks out
between just market conditions and fixed income versus equity? You already discussed a lot about the deposit
issues. And then also, would the dollar may have contributed to that decline? And lastly, were there any
customers that left?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, AUC/A was down, call it, 6.5%. Markets were over half of that. Currency, to your point and observation,
was about a third. We've got a significant international exposure, higher than what most people realize in AUC. In
fact, only 70% is USD. And then client outflows were the remainder. And so, not heavily significant portion of
either AUC or of the decline itself. And importantly, the decline in AUC that was related to outflows, it was related
to, largely, our asset manager clients' underlying business having outflows and our asset owners rebalancing.
But there was no material change in our client base or in our wallet share. And the business just emphasizes that
win rate continues to be high and consistent. But this was a dynamic of our underlying clients having outflows.
And, over time, that works in our favor. Our clients do well and we grow with them. This period was one where
particularly the asset managers had outflows which impacted AUC.

Very good. And then second, asking the revenue question a little differently. Can you share with us what
percentage of your fee revenues are variable rate priced? Meaning, you charge maybe a couple of basis points to
your customer as a percentage of assets under custody. So, as assets under custody go up and down, revenues,
of course, follow. Where does that stand today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Maybe something just to give you a quick sound bite that we could come back on. It's different across
Asset Servicing. And let me offer a couple things that might be helpful to you. In Asset Servicing, 40% of the fees
are not asset value sensitive. They're driven by transaction volumes and account level fees or flat fees. Of the
asset sensitive fees, that 60%, about 75% operate on a month lag, and about 25% on a quarter lag.
And if I transition to Wealth Management, I'll split it between the Family Office and the regions because they're
different. In the Family Office, it's about a third of the fees are sensitive to equity markets in some ways, and
about 10% are sensitive to the fixed income markets. So, close to half overall. And then in the regions, about half,
a little bit more, are sensitive to equity markets; but a quarter are sensitive to fixed income. And so that should
give you a good toolset to work from.

So, Vivek, you're right as to our objective on capital there, and I would say that hasn't changed. What has
changed, as you know, with rates, the impact of AOCI on that. And so, over time, that will accrete back into
capital. And that's our plan, if you will, is to allow the capital ratio to continue to be in the range that we've had for
some time period. Right now, it's just in the lower part of that range as a result of AOCI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So no plans to shrink the balance sheet or anything in the near-term to try and do anything about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So I would say there are no specific plans around that, Vivek, but we do look at risk-weighted assets very
closely because that's a proxy then for the amount of capital that's being deployed in that activity, and are we
getting the right return. Jason talked about the size of the balance sheet earlier and the fact that we do get
positive returns across all of those activities, but some of them more than others. And so, we've never looked to
just expand the balance sheet if it was going to be in low-returning activities. And so that will be the same. And in
this environment, every dollar of RWA is precious.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Different question, a little detailed one. Jason, you mentioned other operating expenses were down due to
lower miscellaneous expenses. Is it sustainable this lower run rate given the cost, sort of, focus that you've got; or
is that just temporary and comes back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
There's a lot of different factors going within that line item, and so it's just a difficult one to predict. We try to call
out the big moves, but difficult to say that there's any trend within that. There's nothing we'd call out at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Yeah. One last one, if I may. You mentioned investment management seeing outflows. How much and
which products are you seeing there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Across AUM in general, the decline's about 7%. The majority of that is within Asset Servicing. And then from an
asset class, to your perspective, it's a combination of mostly cash, but also equity. And then also sec lending cash
collateral pools. But, at the same time, markets drove about 40% of the decline, and currency was the remaining
approximately 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

currency mix of the deposits, and whether or not the FX moves we've seen has caused some shift there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes. Give me a second. Mark or Jennifer, if you get it before I do...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Beatty A
Vice President & Senior Relationship Manager, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. This is Mark. The USD deposits – you're asking about the currency mix of deposits, Brennan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Exactly. Currency mix of deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Beatty A
Vice President & Senior Relationship Manager, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, yeah. So, in the current quarter, it's a little bit over 70% that's US. So, it's 71% US. And then, as you go
down for total deposits a little bit more than 10% is pound, a little more than 5% is euro. And then, you get to
Aussie dollar which is also right around 5% and then rest are kind of spread out among the remaining 5% or so –
5% to 10%. But not a significant change from what we've seen before even though the volumes have come down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then, earlier, on expenses, you guys spoke to taking some actions on expenses to try to diminish
some of the inflationary pressure. Is it possible to give some color, or help us think about what kind of magnitude
we should be expecting as far as those action goes – those potential actions go, and what the timing would be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll hit on timing and from that perspective, it's – we started and announced internally these higher levels of
controls in early mid-September. And so, we're already seeing some beneficial impact from that. And certainly,
change in the heightening of the bar on what we're bringing in. And again, we've got to emphasize, there are still
things that we think about from an investment perspective, to the extent we have growth, we're going to follow that
growth with appropriate level of investment.

But this is also about productivity and making sure that we address inflation very aggressively. Those are the two
components that we're looking at. And we've taken more of a five quarter approach to this year's planning process
for 2023 to ensure we work hard on fourth quarter so that we maximize our ability to do well and be where we
want to be coming into next year. And from a magnitude perspective, too early – we're not going to give the
numbers on that at this point. Just, it is noteworthy enough that we wanted to make sure to communicate that this
is something that – it's been a pivot and a significant increase in the controls around higher level around spend
increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. But just framing it, is it best to think about – because you said that this is about addressing the inflation and
whatnot, and you're not stopping the investment course. But given the challenging environment, so if we think
about this could help to offset some of the recent inflationary pressure that you saw this year, so it's about like
bringing the growth rate down, right? Is that the right way to think about it, or is it more containing further pressure
and sort of like stopping it from continuing to go higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, it's both. If we go by – and it's a good thing for you to encourage us to frame it, and so let's just come back
to the way we usually – we always talk about our expenses, which is around productivity, inflation, growth, and
investing. And if we use that framework, typically, we'd like to see productivity offset inflation. That's a lot easier to
do when inflation is at 2%. Inflation at 8%, 9%, 10%, it's very difficult, but that should tell you we are going to be
looking extremely hard at productivity and where we can look at our existing base of business and find
opportunities to be more efficient.
And then in the concept of investing, that's where you just have to have a high bar. And we have to say, our
growth rate historically has been high, but we've accomplished a lot of the things we wanted to do. In Wealth
Management, we went through digital metamorphosis. In our infrastructure, we went through – we've gotten a lot
of work done on migrating to the cloud. In our risk and cyber and regulatory bucket, we've done a lot of investing
to ensure that the brand that we have is protected well.
And those are the three components around technology spending, importantly, that we're talking about things
internally. So, that infrastructure foundational piece is one. The second is that middle layer of risk, regulatory,
cyber. And the third is around what's client-driven. And there are opportunities in each of those, but the risk,
regulatory, cyber is one where [indiscernible] (01:00:14) we're going to ensure that we're doing everything we
need to do there to make sure we are where we should be as a franchise.
The other two buckets, we've got to think about pacing. We've got to think about who we're using to help us on
those things. There are levers we can pull. And then that last overall bucket of what do we do from a growth
perspective; to the extent that there's good business out there for us to bring on, we're going to do it. And we care
as much about the organic growth of the company as about wanting to make sure that the expense growth rate is
where it should be.

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
No. Thanks for encouraging the framework. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Operator: One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the Mike Brown from KBW. Your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Mike, are you there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I just wanted to ask about the volatility that we saw in the gilt market. We saw some headlines about some
challenges related to processing for your business. Can you give us some context around the situation there, and
will there be any financial impact related to the volatility there and specifically for your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, Mike, you've given the background there largely just that there has been a significant amount of both
volumes and volatility in the gilt market. And we have a meaningful client base of UK pensions that are affected
by that. And a number of those pension clients also utilize liability-driven investment strategies and managers that
provide those strategies. And, likewise, we have some very meaningful clients on that front.
So we've been in the middle of that volume and volatility and have been doing everything that's required to be
able to handle that. Needless to say, it has presented challenges for all of the players in that marketplace as it
continued to work its way through. And I would say still uncertain, and our expectation is that although some of
the volumes may have come down here more recently, we are prepared that they could pick back up again and
that the volatility has not gone away.
And so, from that perspective, we've been very focused on taking care of the clients, making sure that everything
is getting done. And I would say, as far as any particular financial exposure or anything like that, there's no
change to the business model for us, or necessarily exposures, or things like that.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Okay. Very good. Thank you. And just on share buybacks, I don't think we really heard much about that on this
call. And certainly we're very low this quarter. And if I heard Jason's comment correctly before, it sounds like a lot
of focus will probably be on rebuilding the CET1 ratio. So, is it fair to assume that the buybacks will probably be
relatively muted here, and maybe just dependent on how the AOCI accretes back into capital? Or just any
thoughts on the framework for thinking about buybacks would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I think you got it largely right that with AOCI at $1.5 billion to $2 billion on a cumulative basis, that's a high
amount. We care about our CET1 levels. And we've got obviously the – we've got strong – very strong capital
positions, but we think about it so much on a relative basis as well and in an aggregate basis. And so, we feel
good about the capital levels but also have, I'd say, a bias toward making sure we stay relatively where we want.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q

Operator: One moment for next question. We have a follow-up from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC
Capital Markets. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you, Jason. And, Jason, just a quick follow-up on the beta that you mentioned. Incrementally, 80% for the
upcoming quarter is what you pointed out. Two parts to the question. How does that compare to the last
tightening cycle? Is 80% at this point normal or similar, I should say; not normal. And second, if rates continue to
go higher, let's say another 75 to 100 basis points, will the incremental beta approach 100%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
So, in terms of where it is relative to prior cycles, it has not been linear in this cycle. Each rate hikes seems to
have its own dynamic to it. And another dynamic is that, historically, we've seen most of the dynamic come from
the Fed; but this cycle and the mix of our deposits, there's more impact from non-USD currencies. And so, you've
got to play that in as well. It's really important. And then to the second – and those betas also behave very
differently.
And then also our wealth – even within USD, the wealth deposits behave differently. They don't flatten out as
much, even at higher levels from here. Which gets to the second part of your question, does it level off completely
at some point? It does, and not up another 100 basis points, for sure. But each currency behaves differently. And
depending on where we are behaves differently, too. Betas are very high in non-USD negative rates.
You can imagine clients who are highly demanding of getting 100% of the benefit as they were in negative
territory; as they got to zero and a little bit above, the conversations change. And then also the dynamics of what

do alternatives look like. And so the shape of the yield curve matters. And so all those things come into play, but
the direct answer is we don't anticipate a flattening even with another 100 basis point lift, but we'll continue to see
higher betas as we get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, Mike, just a follow-up on the pension answer that you gave over – with the London or UK
accounts. Is it safe to assume that you guys are primarily acting as agent for those customers rather than any
balance sheet risk, or you're not underwriting LDI products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Correct. So, we are not an LDI product provider, if you will, on the asset management side. And you're right, we're
the asset servicer for either the UK pension or for the LDI manager. That's our client. And so, yes, we're acting as
agent for them. Now, with sales of gilts, with moving collateral around, there's a tremendous amount of movement
of cash and bonds as a part of that.
And so, we will act as a go between because of that. And so that can create temporary exposures, if you will,
which is what would be the case that's normal as part of the offering that we have for them. And I would just add
that with all of the increases in volumes and volatility that I talked about, which have been multiples of what is
normally the case, we've put additional resources to every – doing everything we can to make sure that we can
handle those. So, that's really been our position on it. And again, we can't predict where it's going to go, but we're
trying to be prepared for this to continue for some time.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
