Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's sector quarter earnings call. On the call with me
today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions. Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available
on our website, on slide 2 you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call you
will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the company's
operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's
materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking
statements can be found in our second quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 Annual Report to shareholders,
and our 2020 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that you see
our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by
reflecting the underlining performance of core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many
of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise had another strong
quarter and I feel good about how we're performing at this point in the year. The environment in the US continues
to improve as the economy reopens more fully and equity markets remain strong.
Recent spikes in the virus are putting some pressure on Europe's recovery but overall there is a lot to be hopeful
for as we look ahead. As I consider this landscape, we're executing well across our businesses, driving growth
through our lower capital fee-based businesses and freeing up capital to generate shareholder value.
We delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth in Wealth and Asset Management and strong
productivity across our system. This included strong client flows with more than $16 billion of inflows in Wealth
Management and Asset Management in the quarter.
And we ended with assets under management and administration up 28% to $1.2 trillion, another new high. With
regard to recent strategic moves, we completed the RiverSource Life fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. This
further advances our mix shift to capital light businesses and frees up approximately $700 million of excess
capital.
And our acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business which we announced in April is on track to
close in the fourth quarter. Let's turn to our adjusted operating results for the quarter.
Momentum in the business continues with revenues coming in strongly at $3.4 billion, up 22% fueled by organic
growth in markets. Earnings increased 34% excluding the reversal of the NOL a year ago with earnings per share
up 39%, reflecting strong business growth and capital return, and ROE remains exceptionally strong at 37.5%.
As always, we continue to manage expenses well. Let's move to Advice & Wealth Management where we're
consistently generating good growth. Our strategic investments continue to be an important part of what we're
doing. People are coming to Ameriprise for high quality advice experience backed by leading edge technology.
Client satisfaction remains high and clients are engaging with us personally and through our extensive digital
capabilities.
Importantly, our advisors are embracing our training, coaching and powerful suite of tools that are fully integrated
with our CRM platform. And we continue to add capabilities including testing a new e-meeting tool that helps
advisors prepare for client meetings in minutes. Our ongoing investments in the technology ecosystem are
helping advisors connect with more clients and prospects and run their practices more efficiently.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
This high level of engagement is leading to really good client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Total
client inflows were up 54% to $9.5 billion and that continued the positive trend we've seen over the past several
quarters. Consistent with strong client flows, wrap net inflows with $10 billion continued a very strong run rate.
Transactional activity also grew nicely, up nearly 30% over last year, with good volume across a range of product
solutions. All of this momentum along with positive markets drove nice growth in advisor productivity, up 14%
adjusting for interest rates to a record of $731,000 per advisor. On the recruiting front, we have 42 experienced
advisors join us in the quarter, a bit below where we've been. We're hearing that advisors have been focused on
all that comes with reopening and some held off on transitioning firms or delayed their start dates. That said,
people are getting to back to a more normal rhythm. We're now hosting in-person meetings that complement our
virtual recruiting and we feel good about our pipeline for the third quarter.
Turning to the bank, total assets grew to $9.7 billion in the quarter. We continue to move additional deposits to the
bank and we've adjusted our investment strategy to extend duration a bit. We're also seeing a good pickup in
demand for our lending solutions. Loan volumes are steadily increasing, led by our pledge product, which
represents a nice opportunity for future growth.
Wrapping up AWM, our metrics and financials remain very strong, margin increased 380 basis points year-over-
year ending the quarter at 21.4%, showing consistent expansion since the Fed cut short term rates a year ago.
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Results were good and we continue to advance our strategic
initiatives. With regard to annuities, we had strong variable annuity sales with total sales up 88% from a year ago.
This was driven by increased demand for both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product
without living benefits. Together this represented over two-thirds of sales in the quarter, a continuation of the shift
that we're driving. On the insurance side, Life and Health insurance sales approximately doubled driven by our
VUL product which is appropriate product for this rate environment.
Now let's discuss Asset Management where we continue to grow the business consistent with our clients. Assets
under management rose to $593 billion, up 25% over last year from strong business results and positive markets.
Regarding investment performance, the team continues to generate excellent performance for clients across
equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies with more than 80% of funds above medium over the long-
term timeframes on an asset weighted basis. At quarter end, we had 110 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds
representing more than 70% of our funds.
This quarter we had net inflows of $6.7 billion, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. Excluding legacy
insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $8.1 billion. These results build upon the favorable net flows we saw
over the past several quarters.
Global Retail net inflows were $4.2 billion driven by another quarter of strong results in North America.
Engagement with clients and intermediaries remain excellent. Sales and flows traction is broad-based with 15 of
our investment capabilities generating over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. And in EMEA, retail sales
have been weaker given the risk-off environment. As I said, we are hopeful that EMEA flows will strengthen in the
second half as the post pandemic reopening and economic recovery continue.
In terms of Global Institutional, we saw a nice improvement with net inflows of $3.9 billion, ex-legacy partner
outflows with wins across equity and fixed income strategies in both North America and EMEA. I feel good about
our sales pipeline.

Turning to BMO, as we discussed with you, the acquisition will add important capabilities and build on our reach
in EMEA. The business remains in positive flows and we continued to receive good feedback from clients and
institutional consultants. As I mentioned, we're on track to close in the fourth quarter.
In terms of the balance sheet, our capital management is excellent. The business continues to generate
substantial free cash flow and we're freeing up additional capital. In fact, the approximately $700 million of our
reinsurance deal largely pays for the BMO acquisition, giving us additional flexibility to return capital to
shareholders at an attractive rate.
In summary, Ameriprise is in a terrific position. We're performing well and generating strong results. Our team is
serving more clients and deepening relationships. We're delivering excellent organic growth in both Wealth and
Asset Management. And the BMO transaction will add an additional growth opportunity. And we're accelerating
our business mix shift with the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block.
I'd like to close by talking about our team. Our people have been coming back to the office a few days a week this
summer and reacclimating. It's been great to be together again in person. We're looking forward to be more fully
back this fall where conditions are safe to do so while maintaining a level of flexibility.
Now, I'll turn it over to Walter and then take your questions.

Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS up
39% to $5.27. We continue to demonstrate excellent metrics, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core
growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. Sales of our Retirement &
Protection products were up significantly from last year and we're focused in low risk and higher-margin offerings.
We're already seeing a shift in our inforce block and expect this to continue going forward.
As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we continue to advance our strategic priorities to expand our growth businesses
and reduce our risk profile. We remain on track to close the acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management
business in the fourth quarter, which will expand our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and
growing market segments.
Additionally, we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately $8 billion of fixed annuities and closed on
the RiverSource Life transaction in early July. As noted, we will free up approximately $700 million of capital and
will have a marginal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability. In addition to the reinsurance transaction, we
continue to effectively manage our risk profile through product mix shift to lower risk and higher-margin
Retirement & Protection Solutions offerings.
Our diversified model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We returned 92%
of adjusted op earnings to shareholders in the quarter, aligning us to our projected 90% target for the full year.
Let's turn to slide 6. In the quarter, Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenues grew 22% and [ph] PTI (13:21)
increased 35%, reflecting continued excellent business performance. Revenue and earnings in our capital-light
businesses of AWM and Asset Management drove nearly 80% of the total, excluding corporate and other, a
significant shift from a year ago even normalizing for the unusually high earnings in RPS last year. We remain
disciplined on expenses. G&A expenses were well managed, up 6%, given the strong business growth in the

quarter. Overall, we delivered another excellent quarter that underscores the strength of the business model that
continues to yield robust profitable growth.
Turning to slide 7. Advice & Wealth Management delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth, with total
client assets up 28% to $807 billion. Total client flows were $9.5 billion, the third consecutive quarter of total client
flows at or above $9 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our organic growth. Our focus is not only on
growth, but profitable growth. In the quarter, our pre-tax adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 380
basis points from the prior year and an increase of 70 basis points sequentially, despite continued low interest
rates.
On page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were very strong with pre-tax adjusted operating
earnings of $423 million, up 56%. Adjusted operating net revenues grew 29% to $2 billion, fueled by robust client
flows, and a 29% increase in transactional activity in addition to strong market appreciation. On a sequential
basis, revenue increased nicely to 5%. Ameriprise Bank continues to grow at a solid pace, reaching nearly $10
billion in the quarter, after adding $700 million of sweep cash to the balance sheet.
Expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. G&A expense increased
3%, reflecting increased activity and the timing of performance-based compensation expense. Going forward, we
remain committed to managing expense and margin in a disciplined manner.
Turning to page 9, Asset Management delivered another strong quarter, driven by excellent investment
performance and sustained inflows, resulting in outstanding financial results. Net inflows were $8.1 billion,
excluding legacy insurance partners, which is a continuation of an improved solid flow trend. Adjusted operating
revenues increased 32% to $879 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation.
On a sequential basis, revenues were up 6%. Our fee rate remains strong at 52 basis points, reflecting the strong
momentum we are seeing across the board with strength in both equity and fixed income strategies.
Expenses remain well managed and in line with expectation given the revenue environment. G&A expenses grew
12% primarily from the timing of compensation expense related to strong business performance, as well as
foreign exchange translation and higher volume-related expenses. As with AWM, going forward, we will manage
the expense tightly. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 79%, and we delivered a 45% margin. Moving
forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid-
40% range over the near term, driven by current robust equity markets.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this
environment. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $182 million. Sales in the quarter were up significantly off
a low base in the prior year driven by the pandemic. Sales were above pre-COVID levels, resulting in an increase
in distribution expense in the quarter. Additionally, earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the lower
surrenders and withdrawals relating to the pandemic environment. Importantly, we continue to reduce our risk
profile by growing sales of retirement products without living benefits.
Retirement sales increased 88% during the quarter, with two-thirds of the sales and products without living
benefits. This is shifting the overall book and now only 62% of the R block has living benefit riders down over 200
basis points from a year ago. In Protection, sales nearly doubled as we continue to see a meaningful increase in
higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in IUL. This mix shift in both Retirement & Protection products are
expected to continue going forward.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong,
including our liquidity position of $3 billion at the parent company and substantial excess capital of $2 billion,
which does not include the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction. Adjusted
operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 37.5%. We returned $585 million to shareholders in
the quarter through dividends and buyback, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted
operating earnings to shareholders for the year.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just a quick one on insurance here. Now that you've got the
fixed annuity sale announced, what are your plans for the rest of the insurance business? It seems as though
there's a decent amount of demand, particularly from certain alternative asset managers to run the insurance
business.
How should we think about the potential for you to capitalize on that demand and offer up further opportunity to
monetize some of these insurance assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So this is Jim. As we said, our first focus was really to execute the remaining part of our fixed annuity book, which
we think we were successful in doing that. That was just completed in July, the beginning of July. And so, we are
continuing to look at other opportunities that may make sense for us both strategically as well as tactically for
certain parts of our business. And we're doing that more holistically, to evaluate what that does from a client
perspective, what it does from a company-wide perspective, regarding our capital situation, our risk profile and
also what the appetite is in the marketplace. So to your point, we're constantly looking at that as we now
completed the fixed annuity transaction. And we'll see what opportunities may arise in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, shifting gears, another strong quarter in AWM, the organic growth there, really
quite good, building on success in 1Q. So to me, this really underscores that Ameriprise really is a wealth
management firm at its core. Have you considered adjusting some of the AWM reporting or maybe providing
some enhanced reporting that would be a little bit more in line with the wealth management competitors in the
marketplace and allow for a little bit more clean comparison on some of these metrics?
Distribution revenue, including some components that are yield-oriented, compensation being part of distribution
expense, just some of these metrics that are probably really more tied to the insurance legacy of the firm don't
make for the easiest comparisons to the wealth management firms. And so just curious, whether or not that's
something you've looked at or is something you'd consider?

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think to the first comment that you made, 80% of our total business right now is really in the asset-light
Asset Management, Wealth Management segments, with the Wealth Management really even driving the
components of whatever is remaining in our Retirement business, which is actually a high-returning subset of the
company.
But if you take that to your point, we have been moving more in that direction of disclosing more of that type of
segmented results for our Wealth and Asset Management. I know, Alicia and team working with our finance
people are looking at all those things.
And just like we introduced some of those additional metrics, as you would imagine, we have to go back and
make sure that all the data and everything is consistent quarter-to-quarter, how we look at it to track it, et cetera.
So we're doing that now. And we'll come out with some other things as we move forward. But we want to make
sure that we're just doing that in a way that is consistent with both the industry, but also that we're able to report it
appropriately.

Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first wanted to start with maybe a little bit of a
deeper update on BMO EMEA Asset Management acquisition. So, Jim, heard you guys saying that the flow is still
positive, which is great and the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. But now that you've had
maybe a little bit more time kind of working through the transaction, maybe an update on sort of run rate revenues
and pre-tax margins in that business? And how you think these margins eventually are going to look like once
you're fully integrated with Columbia Threadneedle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Alex, as you would imagine, a little different than a US acquisition being in the international
marketplace in Europe. We do not have as much access to underlying information as you would have normally
thought in sort of where you're already in a deal in contract because of privacy and all the limitations there. So it
sort of gives us a little bit of a delay in what we're able to really look at in a much more detailed equation to look at
the expenses, the details of that, the various aspects underlying the absolutes to really then come up with what
we would consider combination of run rates and synergies and other things. So we're just going to have to wait a
bit. And it's not all usual, but it's one that we're – we know that that's what is required at this point in time. So we
will definitely provide that to you as we continue to gain information for that. So we're not holding it. It's just more
that we don't really have it at the level that we would feel comfortable disclosing something that could change.

James Michael Cracchiolo A

It's not that we don't feel good about it, it's just more that it's not something that we can be accurately reporting
on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I got you. I hear you. Second question, Walter, maybe just your view on G&A outlook at a firm-wide level. I know
there are moving pieces between AWM and Asset Management. But as you think about G&A holistically for
Ameriprise off of kind of $820-ish million run rate in the second quarter, how should we think of that for the rest of
the year and maybe even into 2022 given there's some evidence of inflationary pressures building in Asset
Management compensation and things like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay, Alex. First, let me start off. I think as we look at the results for the second quarter, we're managing
expenses in a pretty disciplined way and certainly correlated to our revenue growth. We do expect going forward
that we are going to continue to have good strong revenue growth. So therefore, the expenses will correlate to
that but we will manage in a disciplined way. The thing that I would say at this stage, Alex, is that we are seeing –
we are going to start spending in development and other things, but it's going to be measured. And certainly,
[indiscernible] (26:56) we do not see inflationary pressures yet.
Certainly, our compensation is up, as we talked about, because of the performance characteristics this year
versus last year. But from our standpoint, the underlying expenses are being well managed and we will continue
to spend money as it's prudent, but you could expect that there're going to be disciplined approach to it. But we
don't see the inflation right now, just the normal increase that you will see with top performance that we're having.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. If I could just sneak one more in and a little bit in the weeds. But I was curious about the point,
Jim, you made around pledge loans in the bank. Can you guys give us a balance of those loans in the second
quarter versus what it was in the first quarter, sort of the yield that you guys are earning there and the outlook for
future growth definitely seems like one of the ways to grow the bank's NII in a bit of a unique way?

No, I don't have the – it is growing. And right now, the way we operate with our third-party partner is we basically
do the – share in the underwriting and pay a certain expense. So the growth potential there is very good. I just
don't have the number at hand at this stage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And, Alex, since we just more fully launched this across the system in the fourth quarter of last year, we rolled it
out, it's starting to really percolate. So what I would probably say is that we're in very early innings. But I think
based on the appetite as well as where that fits in, I think it will be a nice growth area for us. But I would probably
say it's still in the early stages, but one that's growing nicely and, hopefully, will lead to some larger balances over
time.

Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Thank you. Starting with AWM, can you talk a bit more about the client trends and the outlook for transactional
activity? And where are you seeing most of the wrap flows coming from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, I think what we saw is a consistent pickup after last year's sort of low period, particularly on longer-term
contracts. So as you saw, I mean, our sales of Retirement & Protection Solutions activity really picked up strongly,
whether it's maybe our VUL product or it's our structured or even our RAVA product, which has no living benefits.
And so, I think now, as you look at the market environment and you look at the ability for our advisors to feel more
comfortable actually executing those type of transactions in the environment and with the clients, even
combination of remote and in-person, that has picked up nicely.
Now, for other transaction activity, we see good activity there as well. And we had a pickup generally both in there
and wrap all through these periods. So the wrap business is really coming from both new client inflows as well as
new clients that we're adding. And we had good client acquisition also during the period. And the flows also were
strong.
So I think it's a combination of those factors. I don't think there's one in particular. I think the environment,
particularly with low interest rates now, that people are looking for how do they get out a more – return more
holistically in our wrap program. We do do balance portfolios and diversify it pretty well so that there's a level of,
what we would call, not just over-reliance on the equity markets but not – and the same time just looking for yield
from fixed income. And so I think it's a combination of those factors. I don't know if that answers your question.
But as you saw, it continued from the latter part of last year all through the first half of this year.

Got it. Yeah. I guess, I was thinking about just the sustainability of the organic growth rate. So do you think there's
still some dry powder from existing clients to drive flows into wrap or is it transitioning more where you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q

...need new assets coming into the platform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say it's not just the transition. I mean, as we said, if you look at – even though we have strong sales
of our annuities, it's still down a few hundred million in net flows because we're not really putting out there the [ph]
variable (31:29) with the guarantees, et cetera. But we had a nice pickup on those that didn't have it. But having
said that, I feel there is a continuation in the wrap, and that continuation will come not just from a mix shift per se.
I don't think that's where the large part is. We're maintaining very large cash balances still and our flows in are
also very good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Thank you. And you mentioned the impact of low interest rates, just a quick one there. What are you doing,
I guess, to mitigate the impact of low rates on the bank and certificate products? And then on the other hand, if we
do start to see higher interest rates, has anything changed versus the last tightening cycle in terms of your
sensitivity to upside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. In fact, I think we sort of hit – we feel like we hit a low point. I mean, if you're looking at what is discussed of
whether inflation's there or not there, what the Fed may do or not do, it looks like there's more of the potential for it
to go back with rates going up. I'll let Walter speak to a little bit of the actual rates or what we're doing with the
bank to complement that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, obviously, the bank is very opportunistic now because, obviously, if you look at our sweep account rates,
they're 27 basis points, and where now new money is being placed at [ph] 140 basis points (32:44), we're putting
an emphasis on more duration than credit. So we're seizing upon the opportunity to be prudent about it, not to
extend you on credit but certainly investing out and picking up that spread. And you should anticipate there will be
more sweep money to play on balance sheet.

John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you very much. With long-term care experience in the second quarter, would you say that's back to
completely normalized levels or do you think it comes down more? I know in March, it was about $5 million in
earnings on the 1Q 2021 call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. It's Walter. So listen, one month, two months don't make a trend. But, yes, the numbers that we're seeing
are certainly returning to the pre-COVID situation. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then my follow-up, how should we be thinking about timing and efforts to reduce any stranded
costs left with the fixed annuity transaction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, okay, as part of our program, we are – certainly always evaluate and reengineer and the stranded cost,
again, is manageable from the fixed annuities based upon the expense base it had in the allocation elements that
we feel comfortable that we'll be able to neutralize that as we do our reengineering and evaluate within the RPS
product and also across the firm. So we will be able to neutralize a majority of it.

Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow up on AWM activities given the strong [ph]
wrap (34:37) flows and transactional activities. But as you think about it, how much of that would you attribute that
to pent-up demand since last year versus the productivity gains from the actions you've taken? And how do you
think about that going forward?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
Yes. So I think a combination. So again, we know the market conditions are favorable, we know the equity
markets are strong. And that always lends itself to a consumer appetite to some – speak about being comfortable
investing. I think part of it is not just the market but sort of the economy reopening and the feeling that there's not
going to be a big shoe to drop, so to speak, in the near term. I would also say that part of it is definitely the
capabilities we put in place and the engagement we have with our advisors. We've done a lot over the last few
years. Just the idea is like we're one of the few firms that were able to like fully operate virtually with all of our
capabilities with not losing a beat with our advisors or engagement with the clients. Our digital activities with the
clients and the advisors is very strong. We keep on adding capabilities there.
We are integrating everything in an ecosystem that works together, not just putting tools on a platform and saying,
hey, we got this service and look how great it is. And usually, when we talk to you about it, it's not something like
we just like thought of or just introduced or just added.
It's something that we really have tested out. We've proven. We've actually rolled it out. And it really works well.
And so I would just say, that has aided a lot to our advisors having this type of engagement with their clients and
also with the way they're able to transact with the firm and the information that we're providing.
So I think it's a combination of all of that. I mean, I can't sit here and tell you, how much we got from each. What I
could tell you is the feedback from our advisors are very positive about what we have enabled for them, and how
that's operating as they're working through things, including some of the capabilities we've added on the whole
advice modules and what that does in client flows.
So that's why we feel good about our system. And we feel like when we do discuss these things with you, it's not
vaporware. It's not something that we just like introduced, and we're making a big marketing play on it. It's
something that we feel really comfortable that has been executed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
So it sounds like if market conditions continue to be favorable or at least stable at least for the near-term, that the
current kind of activities level should be at least sustainable in the near-term? Is that the right way to think about
it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. I can't sit here and tell you there's anything that we see has changed there from what we're seeing. I mean,
as I mentioned to you, at year-end and in the first quarter, I mean I don't have a perfect crystal ball and if the
market fell out or the economic situation changed or COVID jumped back up in some fashion that closed parts of
the economy, we may see some effect.
But I think as we're just chugging along right now, we don't see anything materially changing that outlook. And so
again, as I said in the first quarter, no crystal ball, but we feel good about the continuation of what we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Got it. My second question is related to Asset Management. The margin clearly was very favorable this quarter.
But at the same time, adding the BMO block will likely lower your overall margin for the segment given the
13

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
business mix. But if the market conditions remain stable, any reason why the margin at Columbia Threadneedle
would not remain in that low to mid-40s percent range kind of going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. I would say this, we actually feel like if Europe improves a bit, and our flows turn around there, margins will be
a bit higher. I mean, outside of foreign exchange, et cetera, we think that would be a possibility.
Even if you saw, even where there's a level of margin compression or institutional flows or a little low fee base,
we've been able to maintain a 52 basis points over the course of the year.
That spread because we are winning some mandates and getting good flows in certain of our products that have
the fees. I think, Europe, UK would actually be favorable if that started to turn around to add to that.
BMO is not a negative at all. I mean, that's what you're doing is you're weighing in like $100-and-something billion
of assets that have an institutional base mainly. And with that, they have a lower fee. But we think the revenue
contribution will be positive in the float situation, we can make positive as well. And so really, that's all you're
doing is you're doing the math. But if you said you're at the 40s now and that will stay, and then you just add the
institutional adding that component, it will come to whatever the number comes to and we'll provide that to you as
soon as we get a more fine-tuned breakout of it. But I would say there's nothing that I would sit here to tell you
would change in that regard at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. So – but it sounds like for Columbia Threadneedle, there's still more kind of operating leverage that you can
get as...

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just to quickly follow up on Humphrey's last question about Advice & Wealth. So $9
billion plus in wrap flows for three quarters in a row, you're sitting at $39 billion in cash or north of that actually.
These are more than double or around double the numbers we would have seen two years ago before the
pandemic. So I just want to make sure this is the new normal then?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
Well, I think, Andrew, it's an excellent question. And I think you're right. I mean, we're sitting here sometimes and
we compare it to a little of the level of activity that we saw just prior quarters or year. I think if you do go back to
2019, our level of activity or productivity, our margins on that productivity and the amount of flow activity has
definitely increased. We do feel we're more productive. We do feel that we're starting to hit on sort of the right
channels for that growth. But I mean, if I can define the $9 billion or $10 billion, is there something from some
pent-up, yeah, there is something probably in there. But to your point, our cash balances are up as well. So it's
not as though we lowered the amount that's sitting in cash and just moved it into wrap. So I think you're right in
what you're concluding. I was just trying to sort of talk about it more from a year-over-year basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. And maybe just following a little bit up on Brennan's question. These M&A blocks are pretty active out
there. Maybe you could – I could take it from a different angle is, are you getting a lot of incoming calls? And with
those calls, maybe even a consideration that going forward, you would manufacture and ultimately reinsure the
product as you move forward on new business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Andrew, it's Walter. As Jim indicated, certainly, we are getting inbounds. We're evaluating both from a tactical and
strategic standpoint. And I would say there is clearly interest. And certainly, we're looking at the best shareholder
implications to it, taking into consideration all aspects, including P/E multiple and certainly recognizing the quality
of the book. But we are certainly getting inbounds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Awesome. Maybe just lastly, so the round trip of excess capital will be around $2 billion after BMO and the fixed
annuity block gets completed and you're doing a great payout ratio of about 90%. Any sense of the possibility that
you might ramp that up a bit in the back half of the year and next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I think, Andrew, at this point, we want to execute the BMO transaction. We just completed the fixed annuity. As
we said to you, even before we did those things, we would target a nice return which we're doing and we're
consistent with that. So you can keep that as sort of our base right now. But I think it will depend on market
conditions, in a sense of what opportunity arises in that regard. And it gives us also flexibility. So I don't want to
commit to anything at this point. We want to complete the BMO transaction as we go through and see how the
environment is. But I would just say it's a real positive to have the hand.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
Good morning. First question, just on, Walter, how we should think about corporate following the closing of the FA
deal? Are we going to see an amortization of the negative [ph] seed (44:49) flowing through corporate? And can
you give some indication for what the earnings impact's going to be going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, yes, again, we haven't finalized exactly, but it's a reasonable positioning to put it in corporate. And, yes, there
will be amortization of the negative [ph] seed (45:08) but, let me put this in context. As we evaluated, certainly the
FA book and its [ph] projectory (45:17) going forward, it was – this transaction [ph] was (45:19) going to be a
positive from a P&L standpoint.
Certainly, you would see, as you project, it will be higher than what you're seeing right now. But all the projections
are it will be certainly P&L positive to us as we go forward. And that does not even take into consideration the use
of proceeds as it relates to the freed up capital. So it's risk and P&L wise, as you look over the term of this and
certainly the freed up capital aspects of it, they're certainly very positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Tom, it would be positive to what we would be – experience if we maintain the fixed annuity book and
the losses from that. On a relative – I mean, on an absolute sense, it will still be some negative in each quarter
but, Walter, the size of the negative per quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
You're going to see – okay, right now you saw in this quarter we had $6 million loss. So as you look out to it, in
2022, it's going to get pretty close to when the amortization and the other aspects of it will equal pretty much
probably $10 million a quarter, something in that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. Andrew – Tom, does that make sense to you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
That does. Yeah. And that's – and, Walter that's – I presume that's non-cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
...is the amortization, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Right. And that's not the – and that does not include like the use of capital if we were to use it for buyback or other
things so – to offset that. But what I would say is, if we held it, you would have had higher numbers but this was a
very reasonable and appropriate way, and it also freed up that amount of capital upfront rather than just over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
That makes sense. And just to come back to the question of potential risk transfer, so the fixed annuity deal's
done, I heard everything you guys have said about that you're getting inbound calls and you're evaluating things.
If we think about, we'll call it, the most likely path of outcomes here, would it be something similar to FA where you
might do a slice of your remaining risk, whether that's life insurance, variable annuities, even long-term care, or
would you be open to doing something far more strategic like a full divestiture of RiverSource Life?
And I don't know how closely you've really looked at it yet, but when you think about the drag on your valuation
and your multiple today from those businesses compared to bid-ask spreads in the market, do you have any sort
of sense for whether you think it could be a meaningful positive and something bigger would make sense? Or do
you think it's more – going to be more bite-sized transactions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Tom, it's an excellent question. And what I would say is we're evaluating a lot of different aspects. So as an
example, if something optimizes us for slices, we will look at that as something strategic that merely makes sense
from what we're doing for our system or a client, et cetera, it makes sense, we'll evaluate it. So it's not as though
we're just being myopic at this point, we're looking at it more holistic. We will look at what that generates for
shareholders as well as what it is from a client value proposition.
But when I say that, I look at it – so just think about it, for that 20% that's remaining, again, outside of the LTC
which we manage and it's not going to be an earnings for us, the rest of the business that we have right now
generates a very good return. Now there are subsets like low interest rates or like the IUL book is not as lucrative
as the VUL and other things like that, but even our annuity book has very good return. It's well risked, even the
guarantee portion, and well managed.
And so if there are [ph] aspects (49:35) that are favorable for us to evaluate something different, then we also
take into account the P/E, we'll evaluate. If there are subsets that like we did with the fixed annuity that sort of
optimizes the book right now as other things unfold, we'll look at that as well. So I can't sit here and give you a
perfect, again, view of the crystal ball, but we're open and thinking about what makes sense, but we look at all
aspects of that, not just the financial aspect in the short term.

Operator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to AWM for a second. Jim, you had mentioned that you had brought
in I think 42 experienced advisors, which is about half of what you guys would normally do. I know you said
there's some focus on reopening, et cetera, but can you talk about the competitive environment for advisors? And
do you think you could get back to that kind of 80-ish plus advisor recruiting per quarter kind of in the near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, Suneet. So I think – listen, as we went through the quarter, we didn't expect it to slow down as much. But for
a combination, again, we can't put a fine point on it, but in speaking to our people, et cetera, it wasn't that there
wasn't strong interest and that we're having good conversations, but it's sort of where like some people who were
there wanted to delay it, some people didn't want to sort of like, well, the reopening and what I'm looking at of the
markets or [ph] what they are (51:15), et cetera. So right now, our pipeline looks really good, and we feel like we'll
get back to those numbers, and that's really and maybe even a little more favorable. But I would probably say it
was just the way it came. Now is there a competitive market? Absolutely, there's a competitive market.
And we're being disciplined as well, because we don't want to just – if it's not right for us, we don't jump at it, just
like we want it right for the advisor we're recruiting in that we can help them be successful.
But I would probably say the second quarter I wouldn't attribute it to competitive frame. I could contribute it to a
confluence of factors. And that's really what I'm getting from my people. So as I said, I'm not coming up with that
myself. It's really what I got as feedback as I went through the system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then, just a few quick production questions, first in Asset Management on the
North American retail business. Can you give a sense of where the growth is coming from in terms of channels?
How much of it is A&WM versus the third-party intermediaries? And then I'll have a follow-up for A&WM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we have strong flows across our system in the US in retail, as well as we had some nice flows in
institutional. In the retail, it's actually across the combination of those channels. We've actually picked up share in
most of the intermediary. In AWM, it's just they're getting their similar share just that our growth is strong. And so
they're getting a piece of that action. So they're no different than the third parties as far as what we're seeing in
the pickup. But it's across. And also, I think we did mention that it's not in just one or two disciplines, we have a
range of products that are actually getting.
And I think if you looked at the industry outside of passive, there was a bit more of a slowdown like in the equity
sales in the active. Our equity has held up pretty well. So even though there was a little bit of a slowing in certain
aspects, it was still quite good. So we feel good about the retail and the consistency of it and the variety of
products that we're putting in the market. I think where we had a little more softness was really in Europe. We had
18


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2021
positives in Europe, UK was weaker previously. And now Europe slowed down a little just because of what
happened in the environment. But we're hoping that will bounce back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then, the last one I had on production. I think this might have been asked before,
and I didn't hear the answer, but I apologize if you said it and I missed it. But in terms of the wrap flows, can you
give us a sense of how much of that is coming from, sort of the newer advisors, maybe that you added over the
past couple of years versus the sort of what I would call installed base folks that have been around for a while?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We're seeing – so on the new advisors, we can see the consistency of the ramp-up. Our ramp-up has actually
improved a bit, and we're actually, on a relative basis for the industry, quite good. We're at the higher end of that.
But I would probably see the flows are really coming from the combination of factors, but the legacy advisors are
really generating good flows, organic flows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
