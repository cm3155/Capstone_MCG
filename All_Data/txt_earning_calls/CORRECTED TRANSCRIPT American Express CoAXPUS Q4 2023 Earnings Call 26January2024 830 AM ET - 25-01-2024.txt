Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning and thanks for joining us. 2023 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered
record revenues of $61 billion for the year, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis and we had record net income of
over $8 billion with earnings per share of $11.21. In the fourth quarter we continued to drive strong customer
engagement and demand for our premium products. We had solid growth in billings, strong new account
acquisitions and continued strength in credit quality which remains the best in the industry.
As a result, we achieved fourth quarter revenues of nearly $16 billion, which was another quarterly record and
EPS was $2.62. Christophe will provide detail on our quarterly results, but I would like to take a step back to talk
about what we've accomplished over the last two years and tell you why I'm feeling good about where we are
today and why I'm confident in our future.
Coming out of the COVID pandemic in January of 2022, we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth and we
set an aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving
prior to the pandemic. At that time, we laid out a growth plan with the objective of positioning the company to be
able to deliver on our aspiration of driving annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth over the
long-term. In executing the plan, we focused on listening to our customers and understanding their needs, and we

invested in innovating our value propositions as well as uplifting our marketing and technology capabilities and
backing our colleagues to meet those needs.
Looking back over the two years since we announced the growth plan, I'm pleased to say that we achieved what
we set out to do. And in fact, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on our journey thanks to the millions of
premium customers we have around the world and the American Express colleagues who support them. Today
we are a larger and stronger company. Since 2021, we've delivered record annual revenues, increasing the scale
of our business by over 40% in just two years from $42 billion to $61 billion in annual revenues. Annual card
spending over this period has increased 37% on an FX-adjusted basis to a record $1.5 trillion. We've added about
25 million new proprietary card accounts over the last two years and over 70% of these new accounts are coming
into the franchise on fee-based products.
With the growth in new accounts, we've seen over the past few years we now have a total of over 140 million
cards running on our global network. Our focus on continuously innovating our value propositions to meet the
needs of our customers is driving increased brand relevance across generations including millennial and Gen Z
consumers. These customers represent over 60% of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2023
and 75% of new consumer Platinum and Gold accounts acquired in the US came from this cohort.
At the same time, retention continues to be very high and our credit metrics remain strong and best-in-class.
These strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments we've made in our business along with the
tremendous earnings power of our business model. Looking ahead, let me tell you why I feel really good about
our future prospects. We have a business model that is delivering premium performance and we have strong
momentum which is driven by four key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are
difficult to replicate.
First, our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees, spending and best-
in-class lending. With our subscription-like card fees being a core and fast-growing component of our revenue
mix. We have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions. Our premium
customers are high spending, loyal and drive our strong credit performance. We have a large and growing
partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to card members and merchant partners around the world.
And we have a global brand and a servicing ethos that truly sets us apart.
Our business model provides us with strong competitive advantages, and the way we've been able to leverage
the model's unique elements and execute our strategy has strengthened those advantages, giving us the runway
for continuing our momentum across generations, geographies and both our consumer and small business
customers. The power of our business model combined with the global scale of our premium customer base, the
dedication and focus of our talented colleagues, and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see
ahead are the key reasons why I'm confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan. And it's why going
forward we'll remain focused on our long-term aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of 10% plus and
mid-teens EPS growth.
We believe this aspiration is the right one and we aim to achieve it every year. However, we manage the
company for the long-term and we anticipate there will be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to
a variety of factors such as external environment and actions we might take that we decide are best for the
business. Looking at this year, the continued momentum we've seen in the business as we've executed our
strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for 2024 which is in line with our long-term aspiration. For the year,
we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between 9% and 11% and full-year EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.

In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.70 a share, up from
$0.60 beginning with the first quarter 2024 dividend declaration. This represents more than a 60% increase in the
dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in January of 2022. As always, we'll continue to run our
business for the long-term and we'll do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through
innovative unique value propositions and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security,
delivered and supported by a world-class colleague base. In keeping our focus on backing our customers and our
colleagues, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long-
term.
Thank you. And let me now turn it over to Christophe.

Christophe Le Caillec
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 2023 results which reflect
another strong year of performance and to lay out our expectations for 2024. I will discuss both our quarterly and
full year results this morning since it's [ph] yearend (00:09:10) and since looking at our business on an annual
basis is more in sync with how we run the company. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Full-year
revenues reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter revenues
were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported full-year net income of
$8.4 billion and earnings per share of $11.21. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings
per share of $2.62.
Let's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results, beginning with billed business on slide 3. We
reached record levels of spending for both the full year and the fourth quarter in 2023. Total billed business grew
9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, billed business grew 6% as we continued to
see more stable growth rates after lapping the prior-year impact of Omicron back in the first quarter. This 6%
growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter, but I would point out that the number of transactions
from our Card Members continues to grow double digits year-over-year, a good indicator of the engagement of
our customer base.
Our growth was driven by 5% growth in goods and services spending and although slower than last quarter
continued strong growth in travel and entertainment spending up 9% for the quarter. Restaurant spending
remains our largest T&E category and reached $100 billion for the full year for the first time, while airline spending
growth slowed in the quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending
trends across our businesses.
Starting with our largest segment on slide 4, US consumer grew billings up 7% this quarter. We continue to see
growth across all generations and age cohorts with millennials and Gen Z customers again driving our highest
billed business growth within this segment. Their spending was up 15% this quarter.
Looking at Commercial Services on slide 5, overall growth came in at 1% this quarter consistent with last quarter's
growth rate. Spending growth from our US small and medium size enterprise customers remain modest given
unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Specifically in 2022, we saw a large increase
in organic spending as businesses restocked their inventories following supply chain issues during the pandemic.
This caused a significant grow over challenge with spending from this segment in the industry in 2023.
Importantly, we continue to see strong levels of demand for new accounts, high levels of retention and strong
credit performance on our small business products. Looking ahead, this positions us well for the future as
spending growth rebounds.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
And lastly on slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services. We continue to
see double digit growth across all regions and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from
international SME and large corporate customers each grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Overall, while we're seeing
a softer spend environment, we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our Card
Members across the globe.
As we think about 2024, we are assuming a spend environment similar to what we've seen in the past few
quarters. Now, moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth of
13%. We expect this growth, which has been elevated versus pre-pandemic levels to continue to moderate as we
progress through the 2024 but to still grow modestly faster than billings. Turning next to credit and provision on
slide 8 through 10. First, and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We
attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices
and our disciplined growth strategy.
As we had expected, our write-off and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter as you see on slide 8.
Going forward, we expect to see these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with modest increases in
2024.
Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide 9. The modest increase in our Card Member
loans and receivables delinquency rate combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances
resulted in a $400 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.4 billion of
provision expense in the fourth quarter.
As you see on slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $5.4 billion of reserves representing 2.8% of our total
loans and Card Member receivables, and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our Card Member base. This
reserve rate remains about 10 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or Day 1 CECL. We continue to
expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024 similar to the modest increases we've seen
over the past few quarters.
Moving next to revenue on slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 15%
for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis.
Our largest revenue line discount revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4 and 9% for the full year as you can see
on slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier.
Net card fee revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year as you can see
on slide 13. As we expected, growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier
this year reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In 2024, we expect to exit the year with some further
momentum compared to the current growth supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium
value propositions. We currently have plans to refresh around 40 products globally next year. In the quarter, we
acquired 2.9 million new cards and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new Card Members continue to
look strong.
Moving on to slide 14, you can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis
in Q4 and 33% for the full year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by
continued net yield expansion versus last year. When you think about 2024, you should expect to see net interest
income growth moderate as balance growth moderates with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers

continuing to rebuild balances. And I would remind you that for our business model, we would not expect to see a
meaningful impact from lower interest rate environment next year.
To sum up revenues on slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue
momentum. Looking forward into 2024, we expect to see revenue growth between 9% and 11%.
Moving to expenses on slide 16. Overall, total expenses were up 5% in the fourth quarter and 10% on a full-year
basis, both growing significantly lower than revenue. This expense growth reflects the strong growth we are
seeing in our business, the investments we've made, as well as our continued focus on expense discipline.
Starting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 40% of total
revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year. I would note that this cost came in a bit lower than our
expectations reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model.
As T&E spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter, we saw lower Rewards costs than we had expected. For
example, a lower mix of redemptions for airlines tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend. In 2024, I would
expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue as we continue to
focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our Card Members. On the marketing line, we
invested around $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full year. This is a bit below last year and
our expectations to have marketing spend at around $5.5 billion. Marketing expense came in lower than we
expected for the quarter, reflecting lower demand given the softer T&E environment. However, we saw demand
increase as we move through the quarter and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in 2024. We're
confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine, we'll do so in an efficient way.
Moving to the bottom of slide 16 brings us to operating expenses which were $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter and
$14.9 billion for the full year 2023. This was above our original expectations driven by a few notable items in the
quarter. First, as part of the normal course of business, we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we
continuously look to enhance the organization's effectiveness. We also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific
merchant and like many others we were impacted by the devaluation of the Argentine peso which increased our
OpEx in Q4 by $115 million.
Looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage and our focus on delivering low levels of
growth as we have historically done. In 2024, we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this year's
expense. We will of course continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model
will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed. Taking everything into account in 2024, we expect total
expense to grow mid to high level digits for the full year as we expect to drive continued leverage through our
operating expenses.
Turning next to capital on slide 17. We returned $5.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023 including $1.4
billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at
10.5% within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 2024, as Steve discussed, we expect to increase our
dividend by over 15% to $0.70 per quarter consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with
earnings and our 20% to 25% target payout ratio. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital
we generated while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to
our capital management approach.
That brings me to our long-term aspiration and 2024 guidance on slide 18. We continue to run our business with a
focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth and we believe that it's
the right aspiration. As Steve discussed for the full year 2024 specifically, we are introducing our guidance of
7

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and $13.15. This guidance remains
in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we're seeing in our business
today. We also recently announced an agreement to sell our certified business.
Our guidance and the items related to 2024 that I just walked through do not include the potential impact from this
sale. We do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into
our business as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We expect the deal to close in the second
quarter and plan to provide more detail then.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open the call to your questions.

to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation.
And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Good to see the 2024 EPS guidance and rev guidance. I guess on January spend, some of your
peers have noted a slowdown on weather. Can you comment on that? And then just maybe talk a little bit about
billed business in 2024 in terms of SME.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So we don't talk about monthly numbers, so let alone about a few weeks into the month of January. So I think
best is to wait until the end of the quarter and we'll provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in January so
far. As far as how we think about billed business in 2024, our planning assumption is that we should expect or
we're expecting billings to be consistent with what we've seen in the prior few quarters. And we're ready to seeing
upside, there is some, but for now that's the assumption we've baked into our plans and how we constructed this
guidance.
On the SME side, it's the same assumption if you want. We are assuming something similar to what we're seeing
in Q3, Q4. And we are very focused on winning the recoveries with SMEs. As I said in my remarks, these Card
Members have been through a lot over the last two, three years, and we are focusing on providing the best
experience, the best products. We're focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can and helping them grow
their business. And we'll be ready when they're ready. Historically this has been a volatile segment for us. You
know how dynamic these customer segments are. And we play a critical role in that industry and we'll be ready
when they're ready.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe to build on Don's question, can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue
growth, so discount revenues, card fees, NII. Christophe, I know you said that NII should decelerate. And are we
assuming any sort of re-acceleration as we move through the year particularly in areas like US consumer or
SME? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Hey. Good morning, Ryan. Thank you for your question. So the building blocks of the revenue growth remain the
same. At a very high level, we expect billing and therefore discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what
we've seen in the recent quarters. We expect card fees, so Q4 is at 17%, full year at 20%. We expect card fees to
be a key contributor to growth going forward – to remain a key contributor to growth going forward. And actually to
exit Q4 at a higher level than where we are right now. And I gave you the context in my remarks, very much
supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition, the product refresh and renewals that we are
committed to execute on, and very strong retention rates which we have experienced for many years now.
And when it comes to the last component of our revenue pool, net interest income, you should expect that growth
rate to moderate very much driven by the fact that – and you've seen the trend, I'm sure, Ryan – the asset growth
and their lending growth rate have been moderating over the past quarters. And we expect that moderation to
continue. The very strong growth was a function of tenured Card Members rebuilding balances post-COVID. And
at some stage we're going to reach a more normal rate there, and that will naturally drive NII to a more moderate
level of growth.
I've got to also mention that we believe that the interest rate dynamic in what the Fed will design doesn't play a
big role here in terms of what's going to happen to NII. And when you put all of this together and you can – we run
multiple scenarios, what if billing is a bit stronger, what if NII is a bit weaker, and we land in the same range of 9%
to 11%, so that's very much how we think about the revenue guidance.

Mark DeVries Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. I was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from, how
much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older and gaining share there?
And also whether you're seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer
customers versus older?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Okay. So let me take loan growth first. The dynamic on loan growth has not changed, and for several quarters
now, it's also our philosophy in how we run the company, about 70% of the loan growth comes from tenured Card
Members and what we call tenured Card Members is Card Members who have been with us more than 12
months. And that's very much how we think about acquisition. We acquire Card Members, we develop
relationships with them, then we offer them – we cross-sell products, we increase the lines, we nurture those
relationships, and we do that because we understand them better. We understand their spend patterns, and they
understand our products better as well. And that's the driver. We don't do much balance transfers if any at all, and
we don't have promotional offers, much promotional offers also, so it's very much growing with our tenured Card
Members. And it's part of our strategy to contain, if you want, the credit risk and to control it.
And when it comes to the credit profile of the new Card Members, we haven't changed our credit underwriting
models, right? And we haven't changed as well our marketing channels and products. While we still skew towards
positive selection in terms of credit profile, that has not changed. And I need to say that the prospects that we
bring in and become recent Card Members have very good credit profile.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments about customer
engagement spending outpacing revenue growth. Can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive
customer engagement with elevated investment spending while at the same time offsetting that margin pressure
with operating expense leverage in other parts of the business? And I guess, do you anticipate positive operating
leverage on an aggregate basis with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and
operating expense combined?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
There's a lot here. So let me first take you through customer engagement. The key thing for us and you heard us
say this for years, right, we build premium products and we price for that value. You heard us say as well that
over the last years, the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products. That premiumization of the
portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue. The more
Platinum Card Members we bring, the more variable customer engagement expenses you should expect to see.
But at the same time, we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this. We have a lot of innovation in that
space. I'm going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us.

American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
We recently introduced their pay with point option where you can actually go in the app or the website, select one
specific transaction and pay with points. So we have that constant innovation to try to delight the customers, make
their life easier, and at the same time create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point.
Specifically in Q4, one of the driver of that efficiency or that variable Card Member engagement expense was the
fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets, which is one of the most expensive cost per point that
we have. That drove some efficiencies in that metric. We also saw as there was some softness in some T&E
categories less point accelerators earned, and that created as well some efficiencies there.
The reason why I'm pointing that out is just to give you some examples of some of the natural hedges that exist in
our business model where when you see a little bit of softness in the top line, that creates some savings as well in
some expense lines. So we guided towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable Card Member
engagement expenses, and we're going to keep monitoring that. But I feel good about that trend. And I think that
that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings. We're committed to containing OpEx,
and as I said, we expect 2024 operating expenses to be about flat to where we are ending 2023. And marketing
expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see based on the efficiencies that we create as well.
The model works really well as you can see. And I'm comfortable that the model is strong, and we are stress
testing that model, running multiple scenarios. And it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over
time.
And I would say risk adjusted earnings because that powerful model, what we pay on variable Card Member
engagement expenses, comes back with a multiple on the credit line. We attract positive select. We generate
positive select. We attract premium Card Members who have very strong credit profile. And I like paying for that
as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Chris and Steve, just wanted to dig into the softer T&E
trends a little bit. It looks like you're seeing some softness particularly in airline spend. You're seeing some slower
point redemptions for tickets there. Just maybe give us some insight into what you're hearing and seeing from
your Card Members on that front, and then just maybe in the forward look can you help us understand what you're
kind of embedding in your expectations for T&E from here? I think in the past you've talked about how the booking
trends have been a pretty good indicator of what's to come. Maybe any comment on what you're seeing there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so T&E, sequentially the growth rate came down. I need to point out, though, that it's still up 9% year-over-
year. So it's a pretty strong growth rate. In terms of airline spend and if you heard I'm sure the various airlines,
they all made comments about a bit of a softer demand. And since many of those customers are using an
American Express card to pay for their airline ticket, we saw a similar trend.
This being said, booking remains very strong on our TLS segment. I don't have the numbers in front of me. But I
know they were strong. So I don't – we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But
we keep seeing a lot of strength and the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations of
new cards are very strong. And Card Members decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did
in the past, and we've seen that choppiness as well in the past. I don't worry. It's one data point. And for 2024, we

haven't communicated on exactly what assumptions we're making by category, but I'm not too worried. We have a
Card Member base that loves traveling and I'm sure they're going to keep traveling.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, you guys had alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going
to go up or drift up in 2024. I'm curious if what's driving that. Presumably it's a mix shift between loans and Card
Member receivables. But I'm wondering if at any level you're also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan
portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either – of some sort of shift there, or is it just pure mix shift as the
loan portfolio grows faster than the Card Member receivables?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So thank you, Rick, for your question. So, this is very – this is an important point, so I'm glad you're asking the
question. The first thing I want to say is that the absolute levels when you look at the delinquency rates or the
write-off rates are very low in terms of our historical performance, and on the slide, I put as well their pre-
pandemic levels. The write-off rate is 2% in Q4. It was 2.2% pre-pandemic, right? So we're still below where we
were pre-pandemic. So in absolute, they're very low. Relative to our peers, which I know you know well, they're
also very good. And I'm sure you know that that every competitor or peer reported their numbers and experienced
the same tick, but at a higher magnitude. Our tick up of 20 basis point is one of the lowest in the industry. So, I
feel good about where we are, and I feel good about the trend.
When it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio, the key driver behind this is that there's still some normalization
going on here. We are moving from sub 1% write-off rate during the pandemic. As you all know on this call, this
was not a sustainable level, and base rates are normalizing. And they are normalizing at a slow pace. And I like
that. And the 2% is again a place where I feel comfortable from a credit standpoint.
The other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of what kind of loan growth we are seeing, the
biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are their pay over time facility that we offered with our charge
products and their co-brands cards. And so both those portfolio have very strong credit profile and better credit
profile than what we call internally proprietary lending, which includes Blue Cash Everyday, for instance. So if
anything, the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards product that
have a strong credit profile and high velocity.
This being said, that normalization is happening, and that's what's creating that little pickup. And as I said in my
comments, we're not quite done with that normalization. There's still a bit more to come in our minds. But not a
lot.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'll just ask on capital, is there any updated thoughts
on how you're thinking about Basel end game? Obviously your preliminary expectations of the proposal at least
are that it would take you down to closer to 7%. But there is a lot of talk about that being softened. Just how are
12


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
you thinking about capital management? You obviously increased your dividend. But how are you thinking about
buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So thank you for your question. So not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that we've been
meeting with regulators. Steve met with regulators. I met with regulators as well. And what I can tell you is that
they are listening, they're engaged, and I think they understand our comments. The ball is back in their camp now,
and they're incorporating all the comments they received from the industry. And I'm sure you've seen a lot of
those comments as well. So they have a lot of work to do.
Right now we are in waiting mode, and I think we're expecting – the current estimate is we're expecting their – or
at least their next version of the rules by the end of 2024. We'll see. It took 10 years to get to their first draft, so
we'll see when we get the next version. I'm not too concerned. I feel good about our starting point and our capital
position.
As you know, we generate about 30% return on equity, which means that we generate a ton of capital. And for
now, we're not going to change our capital policy. The first thing we do is of course fund the balance sheet. Then
we distribute dividends. We feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year, and the
rest is going to go in share buybacks so that we keep capital between 10% and 11% of our risk weighted asset.
And that's what we've done for years. That's what we're going to keep doing. And we're going to adapt to the
Basel rule. You know we're running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over their 7% rate that
we have. And so nothing has changed much on that front. So more to come when we get the final rules.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks. And many of my questions have been asked and answered. But hoping to follow up on a
comment that you had just made about the pay over time business. Could you talk a little bit more about the
characteristics of that? You mentioned that obviously that's going to tenured charge card customers, so the
quality is very strong. Just talk a little bit about the yield and how much you've seen and kind of growth from that
product?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So your description is correct, Moshe. There – it's a facility that we attach to our charge card products where they
can decide if they want to revolve proportion of their bill. This is the fastest growing category for us in terms of
loan growth. It was very well received. It was very well received by the Card Members, and I don't know what else
I can tell you. Remember that their charge card has a no preset limit which is an important feature here. So it's a
way for us to give them as well – and it's a paid for product, so it's a way for us to give them a facility where they
can revolve over a period of time. And as I said previously, their credit profile is very strong on this product. Very
much because it is attached to a very premium base, right. Premium Gold Card members are using this facility
and revolving from time-to-time.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. Maybe I could ask the questions regarding what's embedded in the revenue growth expectations for
2024 differently. If we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate, would that sort of target us to the low end of the
guidance range? And then Christophe, you mentioned that lower rates shouldn't help. But aren't you guys liability
sensitive on the charge card portfolio? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So let me take the second question first. We are slightly liability sensitive. And the key assumption for us – the
comment remains that in its totality, our total balance sheet and total funding stack level, the impact of rate cuts is
going to be very small to our NII. The big unknown here is what's going to happen to the beta. We've been as an
industry trending around 0.7 on the way up.
We're probably going to trend to 0.7 on the way down. But not immediately. And it's hard to say exactly at this
point in time where we're going to be when the Fed starts cutting rates. We are making assumptions that we think
are conservative, but we don't know for sure and we'll see where we are. So there's a bit of uncertainty here. But
what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact to our NII depending on the rate curve.
Going back to your first question around revenue, I just – I don't have a lot to say on top of what I said earlier and
what I said in my prepared remarks. I'm happy to be surprised on the upside if bill business is stronger. Card fees
we have good visibility. NII I think the trend is very established. And on billing, as I said, we are assuming at this
point in time something consistent with what we've seen in the previous quarters. And we'll see where we are at
the end of the year. But if the economy rebounds, if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by
economists, then our Card Members are optimistic and keep spending, I'd be delighted to have a higher bill
business to report.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer & Co. Please go

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Steve and Christophe. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the
total card growth. We all know that you've seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of
years. But I was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cards-in-force growth, particularly this
quarter. If there's any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe
having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards, anything on that would be excellent. Thanks so
much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so we have about 140 million cards that transact on our network. Out of the 140 million cards, about 80
million are issued by American Express. That's what we call the proprietary cards. They represent the bulk of the
spend, and they drive the very vast majority of our economics.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
From a growth rate standpoint, if you look at cards-in-force – and you'll see that in the details of our disclosures,
the proprietary cards-in-force of 5% year-over-year and the total cards-in-force, so including the cards issued by
network partners is up 6%. Does that answer your question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Maybe I was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next Platinum refresh in the US. I think
the last one was done 2021 and whether or not you have any plans to do that this year and if that's in your
guidance for the year as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so as you know, we have committed to refreshing 40 products this year as Christophe had said, and
strategically we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of 3 to 4-year basis. And it's important because it's
really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh. We're listening to our customers and putting in
those enhancements and the extra value that they want, and enables us to make sure from a generational
perspective we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change. As far as
specifically for the Platinum Card, we don't really preannounce that. And so I think you just have to wait and see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, FT Partners
Good morning. Thanks. Two quick questions. Considering the strength of Delta Airlines over the last number of
years, it's consistently the top airline, you've clearly benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and
likely spend as they've been able to hold fares better. As we see airline spend slow, does that benefit diminish,
and is it something you have to think about?
And second, in terms of small business, we've been pretty flat now for a couple quarters. Curious what you're
seeing under the covers there. Is this – are you still able to issue new cards or – and are you seeing any
reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline. I'm
just trying to understand the mood better of small business owners? Thanks.

So from a small business perspective, the drive is really organic spend. We're not seeing existing small
businesses spend more than they spent the year before. And that's not an American Express phenomenon. That
is an industry phenomenon. As far as card acquisition within small businesses, that still remains strong. As far as
small businesses looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth, that remains strong. And the credit
quality remains strong.
I think as Christophe said in his remarks, there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup, some interest rate shock
and so forth, and so small businesses tend to be very, very secular. I would be much more concerned if we
weren't acquiring cards, if we weren't engaging in new small businesses or if write-offs and delinquencies were
higher. So at the moment as we look at this we truly believe this is an organic spending issue and it's not
American Express specific. I'll let Christophe talk a little bit about Delta.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full
year was up 15%, and we are originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their softness in terms of
Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip. Time will tell. But it's still going very,
very strong and the engagement with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong. So I don't see
any softness there at all.
And I will say as well that the credit quality of those new Card Members remain very strong. I made comments
about it's one of the fastest growing segment on the loan side, and it comes with very strong performance. People
who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend
side, on the origination side. So I'm not worried about that at this stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings
growth a little bit. Maybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new Card Members
versus winning wallet share? And then just related to that same topic, just how are you thinking about the
environment for new card acquisitions? Is this 3 million level that you've been at for the last couple of quarters the
right level to think about for the next year? I understand that it's dynamic and you'll change, but what have you
assumed in your planning?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers. When we go out and we look at acquiring Card Members, we
really focus on acquiring billed business and we acquire revenue. And consistently now, if you take the first
quarter out of last year, where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of 3.4 million cards, we've been around that 3
million to 2.9 million.
And we will – as long as we have line of sight into a high credit quality premium Card Members, we will continue
to be out there aggressively acquiring Card Members. And that range will be where we see that range today,
between 2.9 million, 3.1 million, and we don't really provide any guidance on that. But with the amount of money
16


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
we're planning on spending, I think that's a pretty fair assumption. And we report that, but what we really focus on
is making sure that we're getting bill business acquired.
When you look at the composition, obviously in a stronger environment you're really looking for more organic
growth from your existing cardholders. And I just made the comment before, where as small businesses that's not
what we're seeing.
And so when you look at any growth that you're seeing from small business perspective, that is truly from new
cardholders acquired. And a lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders
acquired, which actually as we think about engaging with our cardholders gives me a lot of confidence going
forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share but as our Card Members get back
to where they were probably before the third and fourth quarter, we believe there is upside there from a billings
perspective. And we've talked a lot about millennials over time. And we get on this growth trend.
We get on this trajectory with these millennials and Gen Zers where we start with a higher share of wallet and we
start with that higher share of wallet because they're used to using their American Express card everywhere. And
as they move through their life cycles, their wallets increase. And so we have a lot of confidence in the long-term
lifetime value of the millennial base and of the Gen Z base that we're now acquiring. And you see even in this
fourth quarter that is 32% now of our total spending.
So when you think about this right now is a lot of the growth is coming that you're seeing is coming from new card
acquisition, but there will be an organic step-up as the economy gets better. So – and that gives us a lot of
confidence of how we're positioned for future growth over the long term, which gives us confidence to say
aspirationally we should be a 10% plus revenue company. And that's why you see the guidance that we've given
this year and both from a revenue perspective and EPS perspective.
