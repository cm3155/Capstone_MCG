Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Sean, and welcome to your first earnings call and your expanded role as the Head of Investor
Relations. I've worked directly with Sean for over 13 years at Ally and he will be a terrific liaison with the analyst
investor community. He's a great asset for our company and welcome to the role, Sean. We do appreciate
everyone joining us this morning to review our first quarter results.
I'm going to begin on slide 4, performance this quarter remain very strong and our results underscore the scale
and durability of our growing businesses. We've been operating in a rapidly evolving environment for several
years now and the start to 2022, certainly continues that trend.
In addition to lingering pandemic uncertainties, geopolitical unrest and more pronounced signs of inflation are
being met with rising interest rates and the expected normalization of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.
Before getting into our results, I also want to acknowledge and express our deep empathy for those impacted by
the war in Ukraine. The stories and images are tragic and our thoughts are with all those suffering through this
terrible humanitarian crisis. We are certainly hopeful for a rapid resolution, but recognize the ramifications could
be long lasting.
This operating environment has driven market volatility that will continue in the near-term. However, I remain
confident in Ally's outlook, given the strength of our businesses and consistent focus on disciplined, long-term
execution. The US consumer remains healthy, with historically low debt servicing levels, significantly elevated
household savings, and a tight labor market that's come in with strong wage growth. These trends are driving
increased consumer spending, reflected in robust originations, pricing and loan growth across Ally.
Our industry-leading auto and insurance businesses have deep, mutually beneficial relationships with their dealer
customers and have proven ability to drive growth and significant value through multiple economic cycles. Across
Ally Bank, we continue to see solid customer momentum and engagement. The integration of Fair Square, now
Ally Credit Card, our newest bank capability remains on schedule and the business delivered a great first quarter.
We remain confident in the differentiated value proposition provided by all of our digital consumer banking
businesses and expect meaningful accretive growth over the next several years. Ally's success has always been
defined by our relentless customer focus and the strength of our culture. Our deliberate actions for all
stakeholders remain rooted in our Do It Right philosophy.
In January, we announced our new CoverDraft capability, which provides Ally checking account customers
protection against accidental overdrafts at no cost. This follows our announcement to fully eliminate overdraft fees
in 2021, the first in the industry, and a testament to our commitment to delivering a customer centric banking
experience. It has been great to see other banks follow as well. In February, we hosted our second annual
Supplier Diversity and Sustainability Symposium created to build and expand relationships with minority-owned
businesses and we're well underway with the celebration of Financial Literacy Month in April, a key part of our
continuous efforts to support economic mobility across our communities. I'm proud of our nearly 11,000 Ally
teammates for their relentless execution and living our values in meaningful ways every day.
Let's turn to slide over 5, where I'll touch on a few highlights from 1Q. First quarter adjusted EPS of $2.03, core
ROTCE of 23.6% and revenues of $2.2 billion reflected continued momentum and a great start to the year across
our diversified platforms. The backdrop across consumer and auto markets remained strong during the quarter,
and we are well-positioned to sustain robust operating and financial results this year and beyond. This positioning

reflects years of disciplined execution of building adaptable platforms that will allow us to grow and capitalize on
market opportunities in a wide variety of operating environments.
More specifically, we remain confident in our long-term outlook for a sustainable ROTCE profile of 16% to 18%
plus, with the potential for outperformance in 2022 as the environment normalizes. Our earnings trajectory has
positioned us to execute a $2 billion buyback program for the second consecutive year, and yesterday, we
announced our second quarter dividend of $0.30 per share, up nearly 60% from a year ago. Our nimble,
customer-centric businesses provide us the ability to capitalize on emerging trends, evident in our results across
the past several years and in our sustainable outlook.
Within auto, consumer originations of $11.6 billion, represented our highest first quarter in 11 years, sourced from
3.2 million decisioned applications with originated yields once again exceeding 7%. Despite low levels of
inventory and new unit sales, consumer originations were up 14% year-over-year, demonstrating the agility and
scale of our auto business, allowing us to consistently generate volume at attractive risk adjusted returns.
Credit normalization through the first quarter has been in line with expectations and retail NCOs of 58 basis points
remain well below pre-pandemic levels. We continue monitoring broader market indicators of consumer health,
including wage and price inflation, employment conditions and overall payment trends. While the current
inflationary environment will add some pressure to households, consumers are generally well positioned with
healthy balance sheets. And as you've heard from us before, we've made significant investments in our ability to
engage our auto customers through expanded digital channels, coupled with enhanced analytics within our
servicing teams.
From an industry production perspective, we're still seeing low levels of inventory driven by persistent supply
chain challenges and strong consumer demand. These dynamics continue to result in lower floorplan balances
and structural support for used originations and values. We saw modest normalization in the first quarter, but
expect floorplan balances to remain low for quite some time. Within insurance, written premiums of $265 million
reflected lower overall inventory levels. Investment portfolio performance remained strong while weather claims
benefited from lower exposure.
Turning to Ally Bank, organic and accelerating growth trends continued. Retail deposit customers now exceed 2.5
million, expanding 8% year-over-year and representing our 52nd consecutive quarter of growth. Retail balances
grew to $136 billion and account for nearly 90% of our funding profile.
Our consumer engagement and product adoption trends remain robust. Ally Home originated $1.7 billion in the
quarter despite the headwind from higher mortgage rates and slowing refinance volume. Ally Invest customer
assets grew to $16.8 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase, while accounts expanded 7% and Ally Lending
volume of $442 million, more than doubled year-over-year as we expanded merchant relationships and volume in
the healthcare and home improvement verticals.
Ally Credit Card surpassed $1 billion in loan balances in the quarter and now has over 800,000 active
cardholders, up 73% from prior year. I was in Wilmington about a week ago with our new teammates and we
celebrated 1 million account openings, nice milestones for this business. Corporate Finance posted another
steady and solid quarter with the held for investment portfolio exceeding $8 billion and credit performance
remaining very strong.
Performance across our businesses reinforces our broad customer reach, adaptable platforms, years of
disciplined execution, and ability to meet our financial and operational goals. I remain incredibly proud of all our

teammates and highly confident in their ability to continue to execute in a rapidly changing environment. And with
that, Jenn, over to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 6. The strength of our financial performance again
this quarter reflects our disciplined operating approach and the continued execution against our long term
strategic priorities. Despite ongoing shifts in the broader market, the strength of Ally's auto and digital bank
platforms is reflected in our ability to protect and improve our market share, grow and diversify our income
sources and generate a solid sustainable return. Our comprehensive product offerings now serve more than 10.5
million customers with a clear path to ongoing expansion.
On slide 7, we've provided a few metrics we are watching closely relative to consumer health. With over 10.5
million total customers, including over 2.5 million depositors and over 1 million monthly consumer loan
applications, we have unique data and insight into ongoing consumer trends and performance. The average
savings account balance at Ally is increased 20% to 30%, including a 23% increase in the lower balance
accounts.
And while inflation, in particular, gas prices impact spending levels and real wage growth, our retail auto portfolio
has virtually no exposure to consumers most sensitive to higher gas prices. We've also included a delinquency
snapshot across our loan portfolios. Increases off the 2021 lows remain gradual and overall levels remain well
below 2019. While key consumer health indicators reflect a strong starting point, we expect normalization in the
months ahead and we'll leverage our proprietary data to inform prudent underwriting and servicing strategies.
Let's turn to slide 8 where we've included a snapshot of key measures demonstrating the strength of our balance
sheet. Our funding, capital and liquidity remain robust and above pre-pandemic levels. Our stable, cost efficient
deposit portfolio is increased to 88% of total funding, up from 64% in Q1 2018, positioning us well in this rising
rate cycle. While wholesale funding balances have materially declined, we maintain access to multiple efficient
funding alternatives and improved execution levels as we've earned an investment grade rating in recent years.
Allowance for loan losses of 2.63% or $3.3 billion represents over 2.5 times our reserve level in 2018 and
approximately $700 million higher than our CECL Day 1 requirement. Our CET1 level remains elevated at 10%,
which results in approximately $1.5 billion of excess capital relative to our internal operating target and nearly $3
billion above our SCB requirement, positioning us well to support accretive customer growth and capital return.
Detailed results for the quarter are on slide 9. Net financing revenue, excluding OID of $1.7 billion, grew roughly
23% year-over-year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of expanding net financing revenue.
Performance in the quarter was driven by strength in auto pricing and origination volume, growth in accretive
consumer products including our credit card and point-of-sale offerings, normalization of excess liquidity and
proactive hedging activity, partially mitigating impacts from short-term rate increases.
Adjusted other revenue of $508 million reflected strong investment gains and diversified revenues from
SmartAuction, insurance and our consumer businesses. While our financial outlook assumes mid-$400 million per
quarter, we remain opportunistic, capturing upside from favorable market conditions.
Provision expense of $167 million, reflects robust origination activity and the anticipated gradual normalization of
credit performance, although trends remain favorable, as we'll cover in a few moments. Non-interest expense of
5

$1.1 billion includes seasonal compensation items, the first full quarter of credit card operations and investments
in business growth, brand and technology.
We expect the year-over-year expense increase to moderate over the remainder of 2022, as the quarter was
impacted by certain non-recurring items. Excluding the acquisition of Fair Square, we expect full year operating
expense growth consistent with prior years. And as a reminder, Fair Square is projected to be EPS accretive by
the end of 2022, and to drive positive operating leverage in 2023. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter were
$1.86 and $2.03, respectively.
Moving to slide 10, net interest margin excluding OID of 3.95%, expanded 13 basis points quarter-over-quarter
and 77 basis points year-over-year, reflecting significant and sustained improvement. Overall margin expansion
reflects the structurally enhanced balance sheet we have built over several years. Earning asset yield of 4.86%
grew 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 42 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the same NII drivers, I
just mentioned.
Due to strong auto demand, we continue to see elevated prepayment activity in retail auto, driving a linked quarter
decline in the portfolio yield. The originated yield exceeded 7% again this quarter, and we still expect the portfolio
to move closer to originated yield over time, especially as prepayment activity normalizes with used car pricing.
While prepayment activity presents a headwind to retail portfolio yields, we have natural offsets as higher vehicle
values benefit lease residuals and loss severity. Looking forward, we expect earning asset yield expansion driven
by the strength of our market position, disciplined pricing, especially as rates increase and organic growth across
our newer consumer portfolios.
Turning to liabilities, cost of funds declined 4 basis points, the 11th consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline and
39 basis points year-over-year reflecting the multiyear transformation of our funding profile. The differentiated
value proposition of Ally Bank is evident in the growth of our deposit portfolio and the stickiness of our customer
base over a wide variety of interest rate and operating environments. And while we constantly evaluate
competitive dynamics, we expect overall deposit rate paid relative to Fed funds will be favorable to the prior
tightening cycle. The growth and strength of our businesses on both sides of the balance sheet will support a
strong net interest margin and net interest income expansion from here.
Turning to slide 11, our CET1 ratio declined modestly to 10% as strong earnings supported robust loan growth
and nearly $600 million in share repurchases. Yesterday we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share and we
remain on track execute our $2 billion buyback program reflected of Ally's strong capital levels and earnings
trajectory.
We recently submitted our 2022 CCAR results, which we believe confirm the strength of our capital position in a
severe stress and support our 9% CET1 internal target. On the bottom of the slide, shares outstanding have
declined 13% since we resumed share repurchases in 2021 and 32% since the inception of our buyback program
in 2016. Capital deployment priorities remain centered around investing in the growth of our businesses,
delivering innovative and differentiated products and driving long-term shareholder value.
On slide 12, asset quality remain strong. Results reflect a gradual and expected normalization across our
consumer portfolios and continuation of historically low losses in our commercial portfolios. Consolidated net
charge-offs of 43 basis points moved up by 2 basis points year-over-year. Retail auto portfolio performance
reflected solid consumer payment trends and favorable loss given default rates, supported by strong vehicle
collateral values. In the bottom right, delinquencies have increased as expected, which will drive higher net
6

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
charge-off activity over time. We continue to expect gradual normalization to 1.4% to 1.6% NCO level in the
medium term with the expectation of 1% or less in 2022.
On slide 13, consolidated coverage declined 4 basis points to 2.63%. Retail auto coverage of 3.49%, declined 5
basis points, but remains 15 basis points higher than CECL Day 1 levels. Our baseline forecast assumes
gradually improving unemployment, ending the year at approximately 3.5%, before reverting to a historical mean
of 6.5% under our CECL methodology. As part of our reserving process, we consider a range of potential
scenarios, including recession, stagflation and protracted geopolitical conflicts.
As discussed, we evaluate consumer health real time, including rapidly rising inflationary impacts and real wage
growth. We remain confident our reserves are appropriate for a variety of economic environments, including
potential, but unexpected downside scenarios.
On slide 14, total deposits remained at $142 billion, as retail balanced growth offset the roll down of brokered
deposits. Retail balances increased $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter, even as seasonal tax payment activity was
elevated in March. Our portfolio includes significant balances from affluent depositors, generally more susceptible
to tax liability outflows. Due to the financial strength of our customers, we would expect tax payment outflows to
be elevated in Q2, temporarily pressuring deposit growth.
We added another 42,000 customers, our 52nd consecutive quarter of customer growth, exceeding 2.5 million
overall. Our customer loyalty and engagement are reflected in industry-leading and consistent retention of 96%
and multi-relationship expansion for the 17th consecutive quarter, ending at 9%. On slide 15, we have included a
chart that shows the stable nature of our growing deposit portfolio. Since the launch of Ally Bank in 2009, every
single annual vintage of deposit customers has grown their balances over time, reflecting more than 13 years of
continuous growth.
Over this time, we've made substantial investments in the Ally brand and product capabilities. The powerful
combination of industry leading customer service, expanding digital products and tools and competitive rates
differentiates us from our competition, and gives us confidence in our ability to remain disciplined as we navigate
a rising interest rate environment.
Turning to slide 16, we continue to drive scale and diversification across all our digital bank platforms. Deposits
serve as a gateway to our other banking products, including Ally Lending, Card, Invest and Mortgage, which
enhance brand loyalty, drive engagement and deepen customer relationships. A significant portion of Ally Invest
account openings and Ally Home direct-to-consumer volume is sourced from existing depositors, lowering
acquisition costs and accelerating organic growth and balance sheet diversification.
We also see a clear path for expansion among our newer point-of-sale lending and credit card products. Our
focus on delivering digital first integrated capabilities supports our outlook for growth and accretive returns in the
years ahead. Let's turn to slide 17 to review auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of $725 million was driven
by expanded net financing revenue sourced from strong originations and solid credit performance.
Starting at the bottom left, the originated yield again exceeded 7%, which we expect for the fifth consecutive year
in 2022. Consumer demand for auto remains robust, reflecting the high utility of the auto asset class and driving
strong used vehicle values. With low inventory and robust used car pricing, consumers are accelerating trade-ins,
resulting in elevated prepayment expense, impacting the portfolio yield by approximately 30 basis points. As
inventory grows over time, we expect this activity to normalize, driving yields above 7% before any benefit from
rate increases.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
On the bottom right, we've included lease gain trends. Lease gains were robust in the quarter driven by used
vehicle dynamics, but as we've discussed for some time, the upside remains muted as approximately 85% of the
units terminated were purchased by lessees and dealers. This is another trend that will gradually normalize as
inventory levels increase and used values decline, we expect fewer lessee and dealer buyouts, which should be
another positive for Ally over the medium term. So while strong used car values have been a benefit to results to-
date, there is a natural hedge to normalization, including higher retail auto yields, favorable off-lease vehicle
dynamics and increased floorplan balances.
Turning to slide 18, our leading agile platform is built to adapt to dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive
and innovative manner reflected in our performance and the multi-year growth of our dealers. Our focus continues
to migrate towards deepening these relationships, driving strong application trends which we expect to exceed 13
million again this year. In the upper right [ph] ending (00:27:50) consumer assets expanded to $90 billion, up 7%
on a year-over-year basis. We expect to see a robust market that is supportive of our outlook for $40 billion to $45
billion of consumer originations in 2022. Commercial balances ended at $17.3 billion, reflecting a gradual and
modest normalization of inventories.
Turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page, auto volume of $11.6 billion, up 14% from prior year
represents our highest first quarter in over a decade. We provide a broad access to credit for consumers utilizing
our full spectrum underwriting capabilities while maintaining consistent FICO and non-prime trends. Turning to
insurance results on slide 19, core pre-tax income of $74 million decreased year-over-year, driven by the impact
of lower industry sales, dealer inventories and record investment gains in the prior year period.
Robust investment income of $64 million reflected our ability to drive gains opportunistically in volatile markets.
On a year-over-year basis, underwriting income declined $18 million as favorable loss performance was offset by
lower P&C premium. Total written premiums of $265 million reflected lower unit sales and inventory levels across
the industry.
Within Ally, we see significant opportunity to improve dealer penetration and grow this highly accretive business
and we are excited to have Daniel Eller, our former Investor Relations executive in his new role leading this
business.
Turning to corporate finance on slide 20, core income of $68 million reflected expanding net financing revenue
driven by disciplined growth in the portfolio, strong other revenue from investment gains, syndication income and
growth in unused commitment fees and stable credit trends. The loan portfolio remains diversified across
industries and its floating rate which positions us well for expected rate increases. The quality of our portfolio is
evident in our consistent credit performance and asset based loans, comprising 54% of the portfolio. Our $8
billion HFI balance is up 28% year-over-year, reflecting our strong expertise and disciplined growth within a highly
competitive market.
Mortgage details are on slide 21. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $11 million, reflecting tighter margins on
conforming production and reduced demand for refinancing activities. Ally Home DTC originations of $1.7 billion
was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, but down linked quarter given the contraction in the overall mortgage
market. Mortgage remains a critical product for our customers who value a modernized and seamless digital
platform. We added four new states to our platform this quarter, now active in 46 plus D.C. We are prioritizing a
strong experience for our bank customers and enhanced risk adjusted returns, which may lead to changing
origination levels in any given quarter or year.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
On slide 22, we've again included our financial outlook considering the rapidly evolving operating environment.
Since we provided guidance in January, we've seen accelerating geopolitical conflict, increased inflationary
pressure and a significant move in rates as the market expectation for Fed funds has increased over 100 basis
points since our January update, a key watch item as we manage pricing on both sides of the balance sheet.
Despite that volatility, we're confident in Ally's ability to generate a 16% to 18% plus return over the medium term
with the expectation 2022 will be at the high end of that range. Performance will be fueled by strong revenue
growth, annual PPNR expansion and normalizing used vehicle value and credit performance. Our outlook
embeds balanced, competitive and operating environment assumption specifically in auto and deposits. The
earnings and return profile of the company has structurally improved and we remain focused on driving near and
long-term benefits for all of our stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Bill Carcache from Wolfe
Research. Your line is open.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, JB and Jenn.

Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Morning, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. Hi. I wanted to dig into the impact of used car prices a bit more in your outlook. You've said that
you're assuming 15% to 20% decrease between 2021 and the end of 2023, but that's an average, correct? And
just to clarify, where do you expect used car prices to be at the end of 2023 relative to 2019 levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thank you, Bill. Very important question as we've seen very elevated used car prices even coming
into 2022. The guide that we have provided is a minus 10% to 15% on average for 2023. So if you think about the
point to point decline from first quarter 2022 to fourth quarter of 2023, it's obviously significantly larger than that.
So, keep that in mind. It's sequential and it's a steep drop off. Now, I do think the dynamics around used car
pricing is really important as you look at the total earning asset yield and income statement for Ally. As we would
see used car pricing come down, we would expect to see tailwinds in our retail loan portfolio yield.
As I mentioned, elevated prepayment activity has created about a 30 basis point drag on retail auto portfolio
yields even within the lease business as we'd expect used vehicle values to come down, LBO and DBO should
normalize and that should give us access to more gains just even within lease. And then last but not least, we are
expecting inventory to come up as used vehicle values come down. And that should create more growth in a
floating rate asset as we head into a rising rate environment. So a lot of just natural hedges around used vehicle
values.
And I think Ally really wins either way. If used vehicle values remain robust, we'll see elevated contract values,
strong originations, strong lease yields, lower LGD. If it moderates down, you're going to see a lot of tailwind in
commercial floorplan as well as retail auto yields. And I think from a credit perspective, we've been pricing
appropriately for LGD. We have reserves qualitatively and quantitatively to cover and it's certainly included in our
1.4% to 1.6% guide as well. So hopefully that gives you some color, Bill. It's really important to look at this
holistically across Ally.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. Maybe just following up on that. So is it reasonable to conclude based on everything that as you
explained it, Jenn, that that 1.4% to 1.6% NCO rate in your outlook for 2023 to 2024. It reflects and all the other
moving parts associated with used vehicle prices if they were to decline to 2019 levels that you have confidence
that the outlook that you laid out contemplates the achievability of the numbers that you've laid out, if used vehicle
prices were to normalize back to 2019 levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, in the guide, just to be really clear, we have that 10% to 15% average annual decrease and that
would flow through all of our yields as well as into our assumptions around NCOs. And, just keep in mind, we also
have qualitative factors and we've been very mindful of the uncertainty in the operating environment, the elevated
contract values that we're originating against and like I said, we're pricing sufficiently for that and guiding towards
it in that NCO guide as well as establishing qualitative and quantitative reserves around that. So I think we're very
well covered in the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. It's just that there's, I think, lack of confidence of the improvement that Ally has seen in its earnings growth
and ROTCE post-COVID is sustainable. And you've laid out clearly that there are structural reasons for the
improvement. But I think that that just helps get at the sustainability question even if you did have sharper
normalization in used car prices. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Of course. Thank you, Bill. And I think that's a really important point. And also, as JB always tells us, there is a
bull case around used vehicle pricing, if you think about inventory levels and continued supply chain constraints, I
think the guide that we've provided is pretty conservative relative to what we're actually experiencing across our
dealers today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, to that point, even we talked to some of our big dealers. I mean, they're – again, they continue to
be another quarter in and they're pretty sold, four, five, six months out of everything they have coming in on
production. So it's a pretty fascinating dynamic that we're seeing right now. But great questions, Bill. Obviously
you're seeing us lay into the sustainability story here. We feel really confident, but we got a great outlook and
really strong position for the future.

Hey, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So maybe just to start on the net interest margin. So Jenn, you reiterated an upper 3s NIM, which also factoring
additional 100 basis points of rate hikes. Could you maybe just unpack for us what's included in there in terms of
asset re-pricing and more importantly, deposit betas? And then second, can you maybe just talk about how you
expect betas to progress over, let's say, the first 100 to 150 basis points relative to the second 150 basis points?
And how are you expecting the pricing strategy to differ? And what gives you the confidence that it's going to be
favorable relative to last time? Then I have a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So let me start first, Ryan, on the asset yield. And I just hit on some of the dynamics there. But
starting with retail loans, we're continuing to see robust originations. We'll have our fifth year of putting new
originations on the books at over 7% and as we would expect used vehicle values to come down, we'd expect a
really nice tailwind on lower prepayments in our retail loan portfolio. And then even in lease as inventory returns,
we should see growth there, and just it's important that we have this natural hedge with used vehicle values
coming down, LBO and DBO dynamics should shift with that and help to neutralize some of the decrease from
lower vehicle values.
And then of course, we would see inventory levels coming up. I mentioned floorplan, 100% floating rate. As rates
come up, we'll be growing that portfolio at the right time. We also have a better mix dynamic as we've run off
excess cash. We're also growing our unsecured products. So think about Ally Lending and Ally Card at very
healthy yield. So all in, Ryan, we would expect our earning asset yield to continue to expand well into the 5% and
that's with a rising rate environment, but even absent that with the favorable mix that we'll have. And noteworthy is
and we talk about this a lot, the originated yield on retail auto relative to the portfolio just even through April year-
to-date, we've been able to put pricing in the market.
In fact, we've added about 40 basis points of price so far and that's, as you know, way out ahead of Fed fund
increases. So, feel really good about the earning asset yield expansion and the growth attached to that as well.
And then on the liability side, look, we are in such a different place today than we were in the past, especially in
2018 and the last rising rate cycle. If you think about, we're almost 90% core funded, we're investment grade. We
have access to alternative funding sources and quite frankly, we've continued to invest in a very competitive value
proposition around digital tools, brand, the multiproduct relationships that we've been building, the consistent
retention that we've driven.
And so we feel great from a consumer value perspective as well as from an Ally balance sheet perspective that
we'll be able to hold rate at a lower level relative to Fed funds in this next rising rate cycle. Now, I mean, I know,
Ryan, we've gone back and forth a lot on beta math and as you know, we're starting at a significantly lower pricing
position this time around and so beta could – we run scenarios where beta could potentially be a little higher. But I
12

think what's important is even when we run those scenarios, we're still seeing a path to that upper 3% NIM that's
supporting our 16% to 18% plus ROTCE guide. So, hopefully that gives you a bit of color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah, no, that's helpful. And maybe if I can ask a follow-up, a two-part question. So, JB, when we met in
December, you talked about the franchise being able to generate $6 to $7 a share of earnings, but obviously the
world has changed a bit in the past few months. But I was just wondering if you could talk about how you expect
earnings to progress as the cycle progresses, do you still feel comfortable outside of a recession, can we see
those type of earnings and what are the drivers.
And then, second, Jenn, you mentioned on the call that earnings have structurally improved. And when I talk to
investors, they do struggle to understand what took us from kind of 12% to 12.5% pre-pandemic to 16% to 18%
post-pandemic. So, can you maybe just talk about what are the main drivers that should make profitability
structurally higher and why you think they are sustainable? Thanks.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A

Do you want to get started, Jenn? I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
I think these are very much connected. And the key drivers, as we continue to reiterate is just, in retail lending, we
have changed our focus from subvented super prime paper to prime. You've seen our market position and the
continued performance we've had in retail auto and that just generates a higher earnings trajectory as well as a
higher return on tangible common equity. So just the mix shift inside the four walls of auto has been very
powerful. And then, I mean, look, we've added a lot of new product capabilities which are accelerating.
We shared the numbers around Ally Lending as well as Ally Card, obviously Ally Card is a 5% ROA product
driving very significant and accretive returns, Ally Lending as well, and so the growth of our newer product is
really helping to propel our earnings trajectory and the guide towards the 16% to 18-plus-percent return on
tangible common equity. And then, we can't underestimate the power of our liability stack. And you've been out
there saying, Ally has transformed the liability stack more so than any other bank out there. And we agree with
that.
And that is a big part of our structural improvement in our profitability. And, hey, if you want to point investors to
our track record, look at our 2021 return on tangible common equity hit 24%. We just printed over 23%. I can see,
Ryan, this year getting to 20% plus or minus, and then we have a very healthy guide of 16% to 18-plus-percent.
13

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
So we've got a great track record. I think we have a very reasonable set of assumptions going into the future, and
16% to 18% plus return is very healthy because of all those dynamics.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, you guys alluded to the fact that people are getting jittery about consumer
credit, and I appreciate the color you provided on slide 7 on how it's affecting your portfolio. But I'm curious how
it's affecting your underwritings and the decisions that you're making. Going forward, do you guys envision it to
impact any of your loan growth expectations, especially on the unsecured credit side?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Sanjay. So the way that our underwriting strategy is positioned is really to look through the
cycle. And so we're not making big shifts based on macroeconomic forecasts that we know will not be perfectly
correct or even remotely correct in some circumstances. So our position on underwriting has always been to look
through returns through the cycle. We've largely done that in retail auto. I will say we make some tweaks around
the edges. We are seeing elevated contract values and so we're mindful of potential LGD impact down the road.
And so we've put additional pricing in to cover off on LGD.
We've also been mindful of that as we've established quantitative and qualitative reserves around the portfolio. So
we do make tweaks around the edges. I think that we are incredibly well-positioned as we think about both the
pricing and the reserving that we have. And then on the unsecured side, very similar approach that we're taking
and I shared a slide in the presentation just around the data that we're looking at and that will help us to make
tweaks as well.
Again, it's not going to be a wholesale change in our underwriting, but we will be mindful of that making tweaks
and then underwriting is important, but servicing as well. And as we see any kind of deterioration or we see
delinquencies pick up in pockets, over time will be able to be incredibly proactive from a servicing perspective as
well. And, I just noted in response to Ryan's question that we've been mindful of this environment and we've been
taking pricing up in retail auto by way of example, we've increased pricing a couple of times and it's about 40
basis points just year-to-date through April here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And just to follow up on some color on the reserves expectations. I know, Jenn, you sort of went
through some of the comparisons relative to CECL Day 1. Just on the qualitative side, if we compare today versus
CECL Day 1, what's the difference in the qualitative assumptions given how the markets or the investment
community is sort of position – and the macro is considering deterioration from here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, look as we came through the pandemic, we had qualitative reserves around COVID. And as
we've headed into 2022, we've again considered qualitative factors, especially relative to inflation, recession
probability, and in particular in retail auto have established some qualitative reserve factors there. So overall, from
a quantitative and a qualitative perspective, I think retail auto is up some 15 basis points from Day 1 CECL.
So we think we're in a really good position there. And then as I've continued to note, we essentially have a
recession built into our assumptions on our reserves. If you think about after year three, unemployment rate hit
6.5%. So for all those reasons, Sanjay, and I think what you're pointing to, we have a really robust reserve and
really strong balance sheet as we enter 2022 and continue to navigate an unbelievable amount of uncertainty.
Thank you, Sanjay.

Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hi, [ph] Jeff (00:51:32). Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning, JB and Jenn. It seems like you're perhaps suggesting some NIM upside from here just given all
the benefits you've talked about coming through today on the earning asset yield side over time as used car
prices normalize. And I know we're already sitting here today at 3.9%, 3.95% NIM and you're sticking to the upper
3% guide. Just want to understand how you're thinking about the probability of going higher from here or how
much conservatism is embedded in the guide? And then on the slide, you did mention you're monitoring the
shape of the yield curve. Can you just remind us what you're embedding in your expectations right now on the
yield curve and maybe how much of an impact inversion has for [indiscernible] (00:52:15)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And let me just start with the assumption around the yield curve, so we're now expecting Fed funds
forwards to hit about 2.5% at year end and then migrating up to about 3% early 2023. And against that, we are
expecting kind of through time to continue to hit that upper 3% NIM. I will say it could bounce around a little bit
from quarter-to-quarter as we continue to have low deposit pricing and asset yield expansion kind of early 2022.
But then as deposit pricing picks up in some of the later quarters, you could have NIM bounce around quite
frankly over the next kind of six, eight quarters. But I think what's important is that we still see a clear path to that
sustainable higher NIM simply because of the structural improvements we have on both sides of the balance
sheet. So hopefully that helps in terms of just the NIM.
From an inversion perspective, that's something we're watching very carefully, and we're not putting a lot of
duration on the books right now. We've been mindful of kind of adding to our securities portfolio. As I talked about
in mortgage, we're being really selective about what we put into HFI just to make sure that we do manage
duration and potentially ahead of an inversion. And the other watch item and I mentioned this in my prepared
remarks, is simply making sure we're disciplined and diligent around deposit pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, I'm not sure if I missed this already, but just wanted to
understand in the back of the slide deck why the interest sensitivity profile seemed to have been more impacted in
the 100 basis up scenario for the instantaneous rate scenario?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I mean, you have to look at the underlying assumptions as we move from fourth quarter 2021 to first
quarter 2022. Keep in mind, our forward assumption also increased 100 basis points. So this is 100 basis points
on a 300 basis point assumption. And so you're talking about a very, very steep shock relative to even where we
were in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, as I've talked about in the past, we have hedging activity that helps to
mitigate part of that very steep ramp up in interest rates. But essentially, it's just the pull forward of 100 basis
points on Fed fund forwards.

Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. I think the – wanted to talk a little bit about the originations level and the yield and the pricing
comments that you made. I guess pretty remarkable just given that some of the large banks that have reported
have not been nearly as robust. Like, what do you see is driving that specifically? Is it a competitive advantage
versus some of the competitors that are wholesale funded? Like, can you talk a little bit about what has given you
that, is it some of the partnerships? Just talk about that and how it relates to both the volume and pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Moshe. And I think it relates to just our overall strategy in auto, which is to focus on the prime
segment. I think super prime has been impacted simply because of vehicle availability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Where we're underwriting in prime and in particular at the intersection of used and prime, there's still a terrific
amount of transaction volume and some of that's driving churn in the portfolio. But there is a terrific amount of
demand still in the system that's driving transactions and driving originations for us. I mean, as we take kind of a
step back, we think there is some 4 million, 5 million customers that are on the sideline right now just because
they cannot find a vehicle to purchase. And so not only are we expecting this very strong origination volume to
continue this year, we'd expect it in the future.

And there could be some mix shift for more new as it becomes available versus the used and the new. But it's
related to our segment, it's related to our scale, our relationships. We're at well over 21,000, continue to grow.
We're driving app flow through those dealer relationships. And so, Moshe, it's really all of the above. It's the very
important segment we're in, prime and used, and it's obviously the capabilities that we're bringing to that segment
that has continued to fuel just very accretive originations for years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. Thanks. And maybe kind of to follow up on one of Ryan's questions. You talked about the natural hedges in
terms of the earnings outlook and things that could help mitigate whatever – whether it's the normalization of used
car values or rising rates and the like. Are there any kind of active steps that you're taking that you would add to
that, like things that you're doing, kind of, you mentioned obviously pricing, but are there other things that the
company is doing to kind of position for the rest of 2022 and 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, look, we're not complacent on anything. I mean, we're very focused on continuing to serve all of
our customers, starting first with the dealers, making sure we're there to support originations. We've continued to
expand not only our traditional dealers but our newer dealers, Carvana, EchoPark, a number of the newer
entrants. And we're not getting complacent at all, continuing to drive that engagement and that application flow.
We're also mindful of dynamics around consumer health. And so we're monitoring that very closely. I included that
extra slide this morning to give you a sense for how closely we're monitoring the data to inform, as you pointed
out, Moshe, pricing, but also servicing strategies. I mean, we are expecting delinquencies to continue to
normalize, charge-offs to continue to normalize. And we've continued to invest heavily in human capital,
technology and digital capabilities in the servicing side of the house as well.
And then, I think your point on hedges is really important. And as I pointed out earlier, well, there's a lot of
headlines around used vehicle pricing coming down, continuing to see offsets to that, whether it's the LBO, DBO
dynamics, whether that's increase in inventory that we'll see in the floorplan book or even continued origination
unit opportunities that we would expect to grow from here if used vehicle values come down. So again, Moshe, it's
continuing to do a lot of what we've been doing in the past, but just monitoring the consumer health and making
sure that's in consideration and in originations as well as underwriting strategies.

Hey, Rob.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Just wanted to ask on expenses quickly. On expenses, you said that this year is going to be consistent with past
years in terms of expense growth. If we dig into that at all, do Fair Square and more Credit Card or Ally Lending
business change the expense profile such that there are some puts and takes within the business lines there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And, Rob, just to clarify, I mentioned Ally stand-alone expense trajectory for full year will be similar to what
you've seen in the past. So that excludes Credit Card. In the Ally stand-alone expenses, you expect a lot of the
same themes that you've heard me talk about in the past. So we're scaling our businesses. There's variable costs
attached to that, continuing to invest in technology, marketing brand to fuel that growth, cybersecurity as well. And
then Credit Card, I think we've been very clear on our performance expectations. ROTCE accretive day one, EPS
accretive by year end 2022 and operating leverage accretive by 2023.
And as JB hit on and I hit on my prepared remarks, we are well underway to hit that guidance and those robust
performance expectations from Ally Card. And then just, I think it is important to take the big picture in mind, we
do not manage expenses, point in time, line item by line item. We are investing over time for positive operating
leverage and accretive returns and certainly we've been delivering that. We had a mid-teens plus positive
operating leverage in 2021. We would expect to see operating leverage and PPNR expansion over time, but we're
not managing line item by line item, quarter by quarter, Rob, just to clarify.

Yeah, look, I mean, there's still a lot of liquidity in the system today, and I think it's going to take some time for
loan growth to catch-up to excess liquidity available on bank balance sheets. I think that's number one. I think, if
you look at the 50 basis points relative to the average across the industry, it's still competitive. And last but not
least, I think just mindful of the continued capabilities that Ally has invested in, in terms of digital, brand, customer
service, we do think we offer value above and beyond just rate. But I think it's going to take some time, Rob, quite
frankly, to see pricing come through. We have seen CD prices elevate a bit across the industry, you'd expect that
early in a rising rate cycle as the industry is trying to lock in lower cost funding, but not a lot of growth in those
products just yet.
