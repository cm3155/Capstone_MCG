Thanks, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I too want to add a farewell to Craig and thank
him for many years of service to Discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spin off for
Morgan Stanley. Our strong fourth quarter results with a capstone to good performance in a very challenging
year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model.
While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these
challenges and we are in $799 million after tax for the fourth quarter, and over $1.1 billion for the full year. Our
fourth quarter results underscored the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-
over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and
control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.
Looking back on the full year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business, and the execution of our
team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment,
including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits.

Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic. While
other issuers face significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service
as we leveraged our digital capabilities, and our 100% US based customer service.
We kept average hold times under 5 minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly return to normal
levels of under 1 minute. Additionally, our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly
all employees continuing to work-from-home since mid-March.
Similarly, our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base positioned
us well as we enter this period of economic stress. We also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to
mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling
back on credit line increases, and we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan
growth, and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year. However, we took substantial market share in private
student lending and gained share in card lending.
Our digital bank operating model, combined with disciplined expense management, has historically generated
industry-leading efficiency. But in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our
commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several one-time items that have
occurred during the year. Excluding the one-time items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year.
We achieved this while still investing in analytics, automation and core technology capabilities to support long-
term growth and efficiency improvement. For example, we've invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition
marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and
interactions.
Our payments business was also well positioned heading into last year's sudden economic decline. Our PULSE
debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and
higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic. Our Discover
proprietary network was down 2% for the year, but exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales
volume. While Diners Club volume declined, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global T&E spending, we
signed five new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance.
As we look into 2021, we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the
economic recovery. And some of the impacts from last year's downturn have yet to be fully realized. For this
reason, we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year.
Nonetheless, we see reasons for optimism. After bottoming in April, our card sales steadily rebounded throughout
the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. We saw improvement across all categories, especially in
grocery and retail, which now represent more than half of our sales mix. This favorable sales trend has also
continued into the first half of January.
In this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management, but also committed to making
investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels. We also
anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return. Earlier this week, our board of directors approved a

new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan, and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the
Federal Reserve's limitations.
In conclusion, 2020 presented us with unparalleled challenges, but our business model has well positioned and I
couldn't be more pleased with how the team here at Discover responded. I am confident that the actions we took
strengthened our business and will drive long-term value for our shareholders and customers. While there is still
uncertainty around the pace of the recovery, I am optimistic that 2021 will be better year.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on slide 4. We
earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. These results included several one-time expenses totaling
$137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94. There were a number of factors, both positive and
negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive
management of our funding and operating costs and our conservative approach to credit management. These
factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're
seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest
margin.
In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower
loan yields. This was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of
our deposit cost.
Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category
this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the
year-over-year decrease.
The provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit
performance. There was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas, the prior year included an
$85 million reserve build.
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by one-time items related to software write-offs,
charges for penalties and restitution and cost of a voluntary early retirement program. Compensation expense
also contributed to the increase. These were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional
fees. Excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
Turning to loan growth on slide 5. Total loans were down 6% from the prior year, driven by a 7% decrease in card
receivables. Lower card receivables were the result of three factors; first, payment rates continue to be elevated,
while this has reduced loan balances, it has had a favorable impact of credit performance. Second, promotional
balances have continued to decline due to actions we took early in the pandemic to tighten credit. And third, an
increase in transactor activity.
Looking at our other lending products, in student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing
market share and leading to 7% loan growth. Personal loans were down 7%, as a result of actions we took early
in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses.

Moving to slide 6. Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis
points from the prior quarter to 10.63%. Compared to the third quarter, lower deposit pricing was the primary
driver of the improvement in net interest margin. We cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the
third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower. Online savings rates, 12-month and 24-
month CDs are all down to 50 basis points.
Lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin
expansion from the prior quarter. These factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that
we are currently carrying. While this is depressing our net interest margin today, it should benefit margin as we
deploy this liquidity into future loan growth.
Average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year. We continue to see steady demand for our
consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter. All of the growth from the third quarter
was from indeterminate maturity accounts, which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate
decreases.
Turning to slide 7. We continue to optimize our funding mix, and our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our
funding from deposits. We also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next
couple years. Both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters.
Looking at slide 8. As Roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least
$400 million during the year. And I'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several one-time
expense items that occurred in 2020.
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely
by $137 million in one-time expense items. Excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43
million or 4% year-over-year. Yet even as we remain disciplined on cost, we continue to invest in analytical
capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements.
Looking at some of the individual line items. Employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a one-
time item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher
average salaries and benefits. Marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%. Most
of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition, as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit
criteria in response to the changing economic environment. Professional fees decreased $22 million, or 10%,
mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity.
On slide 9, you can see our credit metrics for the quarter. Once again, credit performance was very strong and
total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs [ph] near (00:14:57) 2.6%. The card net charge-off
rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or
28%. Compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the
prior quarter. Credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio, with net charge-offs down 31 basis
points year-over-year. Excluding purchased loans, that 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from
the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were
down 147 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
To wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products, driven by the
actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base
and the impact of government stimulus. We believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into
2022. However, the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance
or material shifts in the economic environment.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. We held allowance flat to the prior quarter. While the macro
environment has improved, the outlook remains uncertain. Similar to our past approach, we've modeled several
different economic scenarios. The primary assumptions in our economic model were a year end 2021
unemployment rate of about 8% and GDP growth of about 2.7%. We did not include any additional stimulus
beyond what has already been provided to consumers. Our economic scenarios also considered the increasing
number of COVID cases, the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase in unemployment claims.
Turning to slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining
above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimums. We have continued to fund our quarterly
dividend at $0.44 per share.
Regarding share repurchases, as Roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our board of
directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock. And we intend to begin share buybacks in the first
quarter subject to the Federal Reserve's regulatory limitations.
Moving to slide 12 and some perspectives on how to think about 2021. We anticipate modest positive loan growth
for the year. We see opportunities for customer acquisitions, but the level of growth will be dependent on payment
rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery.
With respect to our net interest margin, as I previously mentioned, we expect we will continue to see benefits to
margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding. We also remain committed to disciplined
expense management, and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable, long-term growth and efficiency
improvement.
This includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition, as well as investments in advanced
analytics and technology capabilities. In terms of credit performance, as I've already noted, we expect losses to
increase in the second half of 2021 and remain elevated into 2022. Finally, our capital allocation strategy has not
changed, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
In summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio, net interest margin
expansion driven by lower funding costs, flat reserves and excluding one-time items, operating expenses were
down year-over-year.
I'm very pleased with our execution throughout 2020 and Discover's efforts to protect employees and provide
uninterrupted best-in-class service to our customers. The quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic, and
our investment in core capabilities, protected and strengthened the Discover franchise in 2020. The challenges
we face demonstrate the resiliency of Discover's digital banking business model. And while uncertainty remains,
we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit
Suisse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks, and welcome, Eric. And if Craig is listening, it's been a pleasure working with you, too. I guess
both, Roger and John, you talked about the idea of increasing marketing expenses into 2021. Could you just kind
of flesh that out a little bit, talk some about how much you'd like to grow accounts? What you're looking for? What
signals would drive you to step on the gas a little harder or pull your foot off and – because you've seen some of
your competitors already start to spend the marketing, we don't know yet what that's generated. But maybe just
talk about that a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, you saw how we're thinking about the expense base for 2021. And then I'll talk more
specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth.
So, in terms of expenses, the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the mid-term.
Now, opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new
customer acquisition. But, in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing,
new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase
consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts.
So, outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now certain accounts may
go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the
balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down.
In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single-digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some
opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We
didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there. And frankly,
repayment trends have been pretty remarkable [ph] and with (00:23:28) potential new round of stimulus that could
further increase the repayment trends. So that's how we're thinking about growth in expenses. So if there's a
follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Thanks. Good morning. And my congratulations to Eric and Craig as well. Wanted to drill down on the credit
quality and reserve assumptions, I understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying
unemployment rate. However, I think Moody's has been improving their unemployment assumptions and that rate
is declining sort of in the second half of this year and into 2022.
I'm just curious sort of how to put sort of your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels – those
embedded in the reserve assumptions? And at what point do you reassess that? Is there something seeing inside
your portfolio that's leading you to be more conservative? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Thanks, Sanjay. So I'll take this one as well. So first, let me start off by saying we're very pleased with the
portfolio's performance. So the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So in terms of the
modeled assumptions, so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher
than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. Now there are
some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of
the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account.
So first is the overall unemployment numbers. There's about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3
million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively looked
for work in the past four weeks. So to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect
sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to
make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving
assumption. But I can say this we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and in the macro environment, we're
going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment.
So we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers, who would more
likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and
we're going to continue to reassess it first quarter, second quarter and into the second half of next year and make
appropriate adjustments.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning, and congratulations, Eric. And Craig, when I saw the – I'm hoping you're listening and when I saw
the voluntary early retirement, I hope you're a reasonable chunk of that number. We – sorry – when you think
about what you've said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts, that makes sense, there will presumably
be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts.
Historically, when you started to grow the portfolio, again, it's been led by wallet share gains and line limit
increases. I'm curious when you think you might take that sort of brownout on line limit increases off? And how we
should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward?

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So I'll start on the rewards rate. We tend to keep our rewards program very stable. It provides a lot of value.
And so while you've seen competitors make dramatic changes, we feel like our leadership position in cash
rewards serves well. So we have in the past talked about a low single-digit increase in rewards rate due to
structural changes that will likely continue. But beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned in the
competitiveness of our program.
In terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. And so it will
remain that going forward. In terms of what would get us to loosen credit, I think many of the indicators that John
talked about, right? So getting better line of sight in the direction of white collar employment is probably the most
critical one.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. I've got a follow-up to Sanjay's question. Clearly, the credit performance you've experienced so
far is much better than you would have expected, just given all of the different macro assumptions. And so my
question is what do you think you need to see in the data before you feel comfortable releasing reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Thanks Mark. So first will be the performance of the portfolio. So what's happening on specific roll rates,
are they holding, are they deteriorating consistent with what our modeled expectations are. Broad macro is going
to be important. We also do know that if there's another round of stimulus, that will – which isn't baked into our
reserve assumptions, we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors, certainly delinquency,
repayment rate and ultimately charge-offs and required provisions.
So we'll keep an eye on that. Roger and I both talked about white collar employment levels and tax will also be
new jobless claims. So putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is
performing will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in 2021.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I had a couple of questions on the buybacks that you announced. I just wanted to understand if the buyback
announced – like what kind of CET1 you're thinking about when you are putting forth that buyback estimate?
And then the second question is related to that, has to do with whether or not you've embedded reserve releases
in your estimates for that. I mean, because [ph] in this fourth quarter it's trailing federal right now at kind of – circle
of reference (00:31:45) there. So wanted to understand how you're thinking about reserve releases and what your
target CET1 is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. So we continue to target 10.5%. In terms of how we thought about buybacks this year, the first piece, I
would say, is we wanted to ensure we're prudent with our capital, given the level of uncertainty. We do have the
Fed constraints in terms of the four-quarter average of net income. And so the first quarter and – well, the second
quarter and first quarter of 2020 are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of 2021.
And then we're also thinking about the CECL transition impact, which will be somewhere between 200 and 250
basis points as we think about CET1. So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback
envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. And that will
take a dent out of the, what I'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. But our earnings power will be
really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just separately, a follow-up question here on how you're thinking about the interchange
rate. I mean there's been a couple of – there's been some pressure on it recently after years of improving. I just
wanted to understand, is the recent behavior more of a short-term phenomenon, less T&E, or is there something
else going on that we should be thinking about more modeling out that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So the fourth quarter did come down a little bit. And we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull
away from the traditional online – or excuse me – the brick-and-mortar retailers to the online retailers, which
certainly impacted it. But from our perspective, very well aligned with our 5% categories in the fourth quarter,

which also drove incremental sales through our card and ultimately, we think it will translate into other forms of
revenue, specifically interest income as balances revolve.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thanks, good morning. Just to echo my congratulations to Eric and Craig. I wanted to ask about the net interest
margin. And I believe the 10.63% is the highest we've ever seen. Can you talk about whether the trough is behind
us, how sustainable this level is and the extent to which you see room – margins to actually expand from here,
given the room for deposit re-pricing and remixing towards lower cost deposits that you see from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Sure, Bill. So, from the trough, our second half NIM improved by nearly 80 basis points, incredible, so
obviously, we can't run that trajectory in perpetuity. So, a way to think about that is that we ended the fourth
quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned. My view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing,
especially, if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the
competition for deposits will further abate.
Now, how much ultimately we have room – we have there, uncertain. Is it 10, 20-or-more bps, to be determined.
But in my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the
deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then – so frankly,
some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. If the credit
losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin.

So, broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there. But I would jump from the fourth quarter
number and do those steps I just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year.

Hi good morning. Roger, if you could comment on what you think about the sort of long-term growth rate of the
card business, if it's been impacted by – you have a lot of new areas like personal loans, you have buy now, pay
later. Is this stuff just on the edges or do you think that this has some impact on the growth of the card industry
and could you be wrong on that, I guess? And could some of these new initiatives in FinTech be more impactful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I certainly could be wrong so, I'll say that upfront. But we have not seen either of those have an impact on card
loan growth. And you've seen that in the past, whether it's been a home equity loan boom where a lot of people
are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt. A lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card
debt that they are comfortable with, certainly our base, and they tend to revert back to that amount. And so buy
now, pay later is the most recent trend that's out there. We're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able
to see an impact on our revolving loan balances. So, in my decades in this business, there's always something
that's going to kill off credit cards. But so far, the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid.
Now it is a mature business. But we also – as we think about our growth, it's a combination of where the industry
goes but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportion of student and young
adults who are coming into the industry. And so we feel good about that.

Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on your guidance for losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and
then likely remain elevated into 2022. I mean, are you envisioning, just given the current economic environment,
that these are likely that we're going to have a plateau in 2022? Or is it going to be like a slow decline after we
peak in the second half of 2021, just given what your view is on the economy? And how things are playing out so
far?

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Okay. So at this point, there's a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak charge-offs.
And what we've seen as we've gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods.
And essentially, that's what we're seeing today.
It's hard to believe given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment
ranks that aren't in the unemployment number, that there isn't going to be some material impact to credit and
charge-offs at some point.
The roll rates we're seeing right now in terms of – from aging buckets, one to the next, are incredibly strong, which
is positive. So that means, by itself, there can't be an acceleration of charge-offs in – at least in the first four
months of the year.
Beyond that, you would expect, given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate, charge-offs
will increase and continue to increase until there's absolute stability.
So we're seeing a peak in late 2021 and that could carry through into 2022, and then moderate as the
[indiscernible] (00:41:50) and the economic – the broad macros improve. So that's how we're thinking about it. I'm
not sure if we've got it 100% right. If we don't, we're going to adjust accordingly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then the follow-up on your comments about targeting to keep expenses flat across the business, is that
relative to account growth? Or is that saying, year-over-year absolute expenses will remain flat in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, I want to be careful here. It wasn't absolute expenses. So what I tried to do is distinguish between
those expenses that will help us accelerate growth. And we expect those to increase. Those that aren't targeted to
accelerate growth, we expect will remain flat to down. We expect – if you go through kind of line items of the
expense base, salaries and wages, we've done some things this year to level that off including the voluntary early
retirement program.
We have activated our procurement organization around third-party spend, and we've driven a lot of productivity
through that. We have looked at every single line item on the expense base and we're making determinations on
whether or not those expenses will help us drive long-term growth. If the answer is yes, maybe will increase. If the
answer is no, they're going to be flat to down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So just to be clear, those expenses that are driving growth, should they be in line with account growth or be above
or below, just dependent upon what you're seeing underlying the business?

So maybe one way of looking at that, for card new accounts as an example, we expect our cost per account to be
below what we saw in 2019. And that's with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits we're seeing from some
of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I think I've said goodbye to Craig, like at least eight times over the last few decades. I
don't think it's going to be the last one for some reason, but good luck. Roger, just – I mean, so the world has
come Discover's direction, if you would, I think the digital banking, branches banking structure that you have and
then you have the unique asset of the network, obviously. But what are you working on? There's a lot of changes.
While the markets come your direction, there's a lot of new businesses, direct banks, digital banks and
development of companies like Venmo or private companies chime.
Are there things that you're doing as you look at this to be on offense to expand the ecosystem of your products
and services to try to get direct deposits to get more of a transaction banking accounts as well? What are you
doing on the banking side? With all of the innovation in the market, where is Discover investing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So great question. If the world is coming your way, you've got to keep moving to stay ahead and so that is our
focus. We've always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards. But more
recently with everything from the FICO score on statements, ability to freeze your account. And so you can rest
assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer driven innovation across all of our products.
Specifically in the deposit side, we think there's a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts. It will be a
while before they become a material part of our funding base. But with our low cost direct to consumer digital
model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the Durbin interchange caps because we own
our proprietary network. We're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion. And so it isn't maybe the primary
focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. And we feel good about our
ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new FinTech players.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q

Okay. Thank you. I'd love some color on what else you're thinking about there? But as you look at the – your
customers – the customers that you're adding, is there any change in the demographic mix of the new customers
you're adding? There's a lot of times we are getting commentary or questions around, well, the millennials are not
going to borrow on their credit cards the way others did.
And there are other new forms of credit. Is Discover getting the same share of those younger customers? And are
you keeping them? Do you feel there's anything to the thought that the millennials will be less likely to use credit
cards? And, I mean, if so, are you looking at other products like buy now, pay later?

So in terms of millennials, based on the data we see, we're either the leading or one of the leading underwriters
for college students. And the brand is incredibly strong with college students and young adults that appreciate sort
of the leading digital functionality, as well as some of the innovations I talked about. And we're seeing very similar
usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers. So we're very excited about the growth there. And I
think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator, help to get our brand out there in front
of the next-generation of consumers.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Morning. Congratulations to Eric and Craig, as everybody else has said. And thank you guys for taking the
questions. Maybe follow on to Bob's question, but in a different way. I mean, you guys have tightened over the
past several quarters, you had substantial net pay downs. I'm wondering, has your kind of back book composition
changed in a good or bad way or a positive or I guess, negative way based on those patterns?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I would say nothing dramatic. And part of the advantage we had, we have been tightening for a number of years
coming into this. We felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call. Clearly, we didn't
expect it to end the way it did in early 2020.
But that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes, but I think some of our competitors did.
So we try and be consistent in how we run the business. And so we've targeted the same prime consumer. And I
think [ph] Israel (00:49:36) has not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition, either with the new
accounts we're booking or our existing portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And the second question is private student lending. I think you guys referred to some
market share gains in the recent periods. I know there's been some shifts in terms of other big banks that are
exiting that segment. And then there's a new administration and then maybe some changing policy or some
thoughts about potential changing policy, maybe just some commentary given your momentum there and your
outlook there given those factors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, I would say, there's always a lot of discussion about what might happen in Washington about student
loans. I would say keep in mind that over 90% of student loans are the federal student loan program. And so
16

that's where a lot of the attention is focused very different animal in terms of the, quite frankly, lack of underwriting
of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market.
So we feel really good about the business, we clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back. But
we believe we would have gained share even if they hadn't. And so it reflects the fact that the brand is well-
positioned. It resonates with consumers, and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and
differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Maybe just staying with some of your non-card products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just
the outlook and competitive intensity you are seeing for some of the student loans, personal loans, even just on
the network side of your business? I know there has been a focus to grow some objective. So maybe just talk a
little bit about what you're expecting from those businesses as we head into 2021? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So I'll start on the payment side, always very intense competition in the payment side, we compete largely
against two very large players. So especially in debit, it's really head-to-head competition for merchant routing day
in, day out. We don't expect that to change. But I feel good about the products we have and we have a great team
on it.
In terms of other products, we talked about student loans. For personal loans, we have modestly widened credit
on that. That was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatility and the downturn, we've loosened up,
I would say, marginally and feel good about what we're originating. Positioned a little differently than most, we've
always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are, sort of, bigger ticket debt consolidation
primarily. But I would say across all of our products, given the returns we get, these are all highly competitive,
very challenging markets, and that sort of occurs day in, day out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. And then just if I could quickly follow up on some of your NIM comments, I know you mentioned the
funding side of the balance sheet, optimizing that. Is there also an opportunity a little bit to optimize on the asset
side of the balance sheet? Maybe you were running with a little bit of excess cash in 2020 given the downturn, or
is that fairly well optimized already? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah, thanks. I'll jump in on that one. Yeah, we do have some excess liquidity right now, and there is an
opportunity to continue to move that forward. Now we're going to, I'll say, gauge that based on the level of asset
17


Discover Financial Services
(DFS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity. And we've built a plan that assumes a level of growth. So
that's one positive.
The other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in, turning into cash. And then in
terms of balance sheet positioning, we are mildly asset sensitive right now. So in a rising rate environment, that
will also be beneficial to net interest margin.
So quite honestly, the liquidity, I think, will take care of itself over time. And the positioning of the balance sheet in
terms of asset sensitivity, very, very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about
deposit growth specifically, both the direct-to-consumer and the broker deposits? I guess for DTC, it's now, I
guess, 62% of total funding. I believe previously, you mentioned a longer term target of 70% of the funding stack.
[ph] Does that part (00:55:22) still hold or do you expect DTC deposits to be even higher as a percentage of the
funding stack going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we're targeting 70%, 80%. So 62%, you're correct on the number. So direct-to-consumer, our
proposition's been very, very positive. We don't compete on the basis of price, which has been a good thing in
terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have. But also, the fact that deposits continue to
grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the Discover brand.
In terms of the broker CDs, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right. So as our funding needs
increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered CDs. As they decrease, we shrink it. So that's the way we've
managed it traditionally. It's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what I'd say, a less important
channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. And then a second question. Just broad based, is there, I guess, anything structurally different in regards
to releasing reserves under CECL than in the prior method of looking at allowance reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Not so much structurally. I mean, we've got a thorough process that considers all the elements of CECL under
GAAP. The one thing I would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling, and frankly, a greater
level of judgment, given how far out into the horizon you're projecting losses. So there's certainly a very strong
18

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
governance element. There's a science to it and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well.
So – yeah, same could be said for incurred, but the horizon's much more difficult given timing of what we're trying
to project.

Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the
line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks so much for taking my questions. Can we just think about a potential windfall of excess capital from
reserve releases? If that was to happen and the economic situation persisted the way it is today and you felt
comfortable releasing the reserves, can you talk about the breakdown of how you would use that excess capital? I
mean, when tax reform came, then there was a flood of capital, companies started talking about we'll do half – or
a third for growth, a third for capital return, a third for investment in technology, something like that. Can you talk
about how you think about those pieces should a flood of capital come your way? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'll let John talk about capital return, but I would say, our business does not lend itself to rapid deployment
of capital, right? We market on a consistent basis, sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the
amount of capital we have, I don't think makes sense from a long-term standpoint.
The same holds true for technology, right? A lot of it is about spending smart, not just putting huge amounts of
money. So I have a real hard – if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release, there may be some things at
the margin in terms of investments in the business. But by and large, it will fall to the bottom line. And I'll let John
pick it up there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And so Dominick, I do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases
and a powerful economy. Our priorities actually remain the same. So in terms of how we think about capital and
allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases. And then the last priority would be
small M&A, I think, bolt-on capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive long-term shareholder
value. So, no change there.
We go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do. And we share
the outlook with our board and our priorities. And obviously there's some regulatory constraints that we manage to
as well. And then we'll make good long-term decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return.

Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then if we just think about the – if you look at the NIM, in particular, this
quarter and the interest charge-off reduction in the quarter. That had a big impact on the yield. And so could you
just talk about the balance between, let's say, that interest and fee charge-off even just reverting to normalized
level, not including the spike of loss, I would say, but has that sort of just normalized over 2021 versus some of
the benefits you have on the interest expense savings that you're doing, given all the – what you're doing there?
Maybe if you balance those two against each other, could you still see kind of NIM expansion or levels in 2021
versus stable to improving versus 2020? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Dominick, we do see opportunities for NIM expansion even in the face of increased interest charge-offs as
the portfolio matures and contend with some of the economic stress. But the numbers in terms of quantum, I'm
probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here. But I will go back to what I said earlier in one of
my questions in terms of how to think about it. So we do see an opportunity for NIM expansion. And that – some
of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies, but even contemplating that, there will be a level
of expansion.
