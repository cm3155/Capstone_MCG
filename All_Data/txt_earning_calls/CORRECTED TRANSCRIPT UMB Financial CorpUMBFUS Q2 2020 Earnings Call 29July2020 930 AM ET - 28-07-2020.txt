Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.
As we all navigate our way through not only a global pandemic but an increasingly polarized and highly politicized
environment, we have been engaging our associates, customers and communities through proactive outreach
and dialogue.
Inclusion and diversity have always been core principles for UMB. However, like many others, we've taken more
action in this time of heightened sensitivity. We offer a variety of resource groups for our associates and they're
hosting ongoing conversations to educate and dispel stereotypes as well as foster inclusion.
On page 5 of the slides, we concluded a few comments on our inclusion and diversity efforts along with some key
topics. I encourage you to read our recent corporate citizenship update by using the links shown there. During the
quarter, we have continued to serve our customers fully while most of our workforce remains off-site.
We've begun seeing customers in our branches by appointment only and continue our drive-thru operations at
most locations. Our sales teams have had success with virtual calling efforts, meetings with clients via video in
some instances, and I'm extremely proud and impressed with how our associates continue to adapt and perform.
We're taking a measured approach in our return to the workplace bringing back a small percentage of our
employees on a phase-in basis and including enhanced safety protocols. While I'd like to see more of our team
back in the office, health and safety will take a priority.
Last quarter, I shared my thoughts on the economic crisis paired with the unfortunate timing of the implementation
of CECL and its likely impact on our industry. As we continue to see, there is a great deal of subjectivity on how
banks apply the methodology making comparisons of actual risk difficult at best.
So, we focus on what we know and our priorities continue to be, maintaining the high-quality underwriting
standards that are served as well over the long term, maintaining solid capital liquidity levels to carry us through
this crisis and doing what's right to support our workforce, customers and communities.
We entered the second half of the year in a position to manage what lies ahead. We had solid capital levels and a
very strong liquidity position, with a loan-to-deposit ratio that provides us flexibility. And most importantly, we have
an experienced credit team with a superior track record, particularly in times of crisis. As it relates to the US
economy, we are navigating through the murky waters, muddled by global pandemic and deep-rooted social
issues where every issue is further politicized particularly in election year.
For these reasons, the overall economy continues to be fragile and these uncertainties will likely persist into the
next year. However, within our markets and among our borrowers, we haven't seen any significant signs of
deterioration today.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Now, I'll turn to our second quarter results, which highlighted the balance sheet strength I mentioned, along with
the quality of our underwriting practices, as evidenced by our 15 basis points of net charge-offs. 30 days into the
quarter, we continue to hear that our customers generally remain prepared to weather the current economic
headwinds. We posted net income of $60.5 million or $1.26 per share on a GAAP basis and $63.8 million or
$1.33 per share on an operating basis. Pre-tax pre-provision income of $90.2 million represents a 7.6% increase
over the linked quarter and a 15% increase compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Total fee income was strong at $120.5 million. While this included some market-related adjustments, including
COLI evaluations, we saw positive results in investment banking. At higher trading volumes, particularly in
municipals and MBS, drove the linked quarter increase of $6.2 million, which you can find in our trading and
investment banking line.
Similar to trends across the industry, we've seen reductions in 12b-1 fees in our brokerage business as well as
reduced credit and debit card spend across most categories. Net interest income increased 2.5% from first
quarter driven by lower deposit and borrowing costs, along with strong loan volume which included $1.5 billion in
PPP loans.
New loan production outside of PPP remained strong at $706 million, and payouts and paydowns were slightly
lower than historical averages at 3.2% of balances, excluding PPP. Organic growth was partly negated by the
normalization of commercial line utilization, which was 31% at June 30 following the spike to 39% in the first
quarter from the initial impact of COVID.
In addition, some active deals we had in the pipeline at the end of the first quarter were pushed out of it as
customers pause to understand the implications of the crisis. Looking ahead into the third quarter, we continue to
see robust activity. Average loan balances excluding PPP increased 8.2% on a linked-quarter basis annualized.
Driven by commercial and consumer real estate, our C&I balances were impacted by the normalization of line
utilization.
Mortgage prequalification applications hit record highs during the quarter helping to drive an 8.1% quarterly
increase in consumer real estate. The composition of our loan portfolio which remains diverse and well-balanced
across several product lines, geographies, and industries is shown on slide 18 in the balance sheet section of the
presentation, followed by loan activity during the quarter and break downs of our commercial portfolios by asset
class.
On slide 22, we've updated our exposure to sensitive industries that we shared in April. We removed
transportation after reviewing its performance. That group is largely comprised of freight and warehouse
relationships with top industry companies, and we've had little exposure to travel-related businesses. We've
added senior living CRE to the list based on the potential strain on occupancy levels and operating expenses
related to the COVID restrictions and increased pandemic-related costs. This category represents 2.1% of our
loan portfolio or just 1.6% when risk adjusted.
As we did last quarter, we again looked at each category for specific characteristics or specific credits that we feel
comfortable with, as well as those which may carry more risk if the crisis is prolonged. After an in-depth analysis,
the portion we view as potentially being more impacted represents about 10% of total loans, excluding PPP
balances.
Of course, this is an indication that we expect lots of in this portfolio, but we continue to keep a close eye on the
conditions as they evolve. We've included some details and considerations in each category on the slide. Details

on the $1.5 billion in PPP loans we booked during the quarter are shown on slide 23. The median size was
$56,000. And as you can see, they're broadly diversified among industries.
Now, looking at asset quality and provision, you see on slide 27 that second quarter provision under CECL was
$21.5 million, which represents 3.9 times net charge-offs of $5.5 million. As we noted previously, our substantial
provision and reserve build in the first quarter was prudent and conservative. The additional reserve build in the
second quarter brings our total allowance for loan losses to $200.3 million as of June 30, with an allowance-to-
loan coverage of 1.3%. Excluding PPP loans, that coverage is 1.45% or nearly 2 times what it was at year-end
2019 prior to the adoption of CECL.
Total reserves to non-performing assets is now 2.3 times compared to the peer median of 1.6 times based on
those who have reported to-date. Net charge-offs to average loans for the quarter of [ph] just a few (00:10:40)
basis points is better than our long-term historical performance and NPLs improved from the first quarter to 0.54%
of loans.
UMB has always had a reputation for being responsive, consistent and prudent as it relates to credit. And we
have a good long-term track record for keeping rank credits from moving to loss based on our relationship with
our clients. While this unpredictable environment is a new territory for all of us, we'll keep our focus on risk
management and believe that our credit quality will remain one of the key differentiators, especially during periods
of stress.
This quarter, we've added a more granular look at loans by type in the loan risk table on slide 29. This data shows
the quality inherent in our portfolio. We're continuing to provide flexibility for our clients through modifications and
you'll see those totals in the table as well. Based on initial requests, we approved approximately $2.1 billion in
modifications. However, many of those were ultimately not accepted as customers determined they weren't fully
necessary. This speaks to the general strength of our customer base. At June 30, we had loan modifications of
$1.3 billion on our books, representing 9.6% of the portfolio, excluding PPP balances. This includes our proactive
offer of six-month deferrals to our practice solutions clients, largely dental offices in our business banking group.
Our teams are in regular contact with our clients and have ongoing dialogue and [ph] clearly (00:12:21)
conversations with our CRE customers indicate that a good portion will begin making payments at the end of the
deferral period. As we indicated last quarter, a significant number of our borrowers within the sensitive industries
has strong balance sheets and sponsors.
Well ahead of the pandemic, we have begun the reinvigoration of our retail business, including online banking
upgrades, online account opening and our new teller platform. We onboarded the second wave of our existing
online banking users just days after we moved our branch operations to drive-thru only in mid-March. The usage
has increased, although the timing makes it difficult to fully gauge the drivers of the uptake among our customers.
The average number of daily online banking users increased by 12% during the second quarter and the number
of users enrolled in our personal finance tool and the new platform increased 42% from March to June. Mobile
deposit capture has increased 44% since customer access to branches was limited. And finally, since our online
account opening capabilities fully launched in May, about 17% of our new DDA accounts have been opened
through the digital channel. Ultimately, it's clear that a mix of options is important to our customer base and we'll
continue to make sure our network has the appropriate capabilities. We continually look at staffing and the use of
technology as we transform our digital offering, especially in light of the headwinds we're living through.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
In closing, I reiterate what I said at the beginning. We're in a sound position to navigate what lies ahead. We
continue to manage for the long term with a strong capital and liquidity position, a history of prudent risk
management and diverse revenue sources to help provide buffers in the interest rate environment we're living in.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram to discuss some of the drivers of our results. Ram?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. I'll begin with comments on CECL and the drivers of our allowance for credit losses, which
begin on slide 25. As we previously discussed, we took a conservative approach to our first quarter modeling
considering the volatility and frequent changes in economic expectations we saw at that time.
As Mariner noted, our second quarter provision for credit losses totaled $21.5 million, down from $88 million in the
linked quarter. Approximately half of the provisioning in the second quarter reflected changes in key
macroeconomic variables as prescribed in the Moody's baseline economic forecast issued in June as well as
consideration for modified loans.
Future provisioning levels will continue to be predicated on loan growth, any changes in our portfolio mix, net
charge-offs and forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions that drive our econometric models. At June 30,
nearly 85% of our allowance from credit losses was attributed to our commercial and commercial real estate
portfolios.
Now, looking at the quarterly results, net interest income of $178.2 million represents an increase of $4.3 million
from the first quarter, benefiting from a 58 basis points reduction in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and loan
volumes, including PPP loans. These were offset by the adverse impact of 105 basis point quarter-over-quarter
decrease in the one month LIBOR rate. Total earning asset yields fell 57 basis points to 3.01% from the linked
quarter, driven by a 73 basis point decline in loan yields. Net interest spread increased 1 basis point over the first
quarter and was down only 5 basis points from the year-ago period.
Net interest margin compressed by 18 basis points from the first quarter. Drivers of the change included a 34
basis point reduction from loan yields, which included a negative 3 basis points to margin from PPP loans and
positive 2 basis points from the synthetic floor we have in place, a 19 basis points reduction from excess liquidity
and the reduced benefit of free funds, negative 2 basis points from lower reinvestment rates and market changes
in the AFS portfolio, partially offset by a positive 38 basis points impact from lower interest-bearing liability costs,
including a 53 basis points reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.3%.
As stated, fee income was $120.5 million for the quarter and reflected continued impacts from the volatile market,
including a valuation adjustment in company-owned life insurance income, which resulted in a $24.8 million swing
from the last quarter, which is included in the other income line. This increase is offset by a similar increase in
deferred compensation expense.
As Mariner mentioned, increased muni and MBS volumes drove solid increases in our investment banking
income, supplemented by market valuation benefits from our trading portfolio. Offsets included a $4.1 million
reduction of brokerage fees and a $3.6 million reduction in bankcard income.
We've been watching as peers have reported results and it's clear that the pandemic had dramatically impacted
credit and debit card spending patterns. Our card purchase volume stats are on slide 9. On a year-over-year
basis, we saw a 17% decline in total card volumes, driven largely by reduced healthcare spending as people have

delayed some routine medical and dental care, as well as decreases in travel, gasoline, restaurants and
entertainment spending. On the commercial front, corporate travel and entertainment have been curtailed and
municipalities, which make up a good portion of our card business, have seen declines related to school closings
and reduction in other usual activities.
Expenses for the quarter increased 10.6% or $19.9 million compared to the first quarter, driven by a $24.6 million
increase in deferred compensation expense, the offset to the increased COLI income I mentioned. In the salaries
and benefits line, this increase was partially offset by lower payroll taxes and profit sharing and 401(k) expense.
Marketing expense decreased $1.4 million compared to the first quarter from the decline in travel and business
development activities due to the pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $4 million in non-recurring costs tied to our
COVID-19 response. For the full year 2020, we anticipate the tax rate will be approximately 12% to 14%.
Moving back to the balance sheet. Average deposits increased 9.4% on a linked quarter basis and free funds now
comprise nearly 34% of total deposits. We estimate that about $516 million of demand deposit balances at June
30 were related to PPP funds disbursed to our customers.
We continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with the CET1 ratio of 11.92% based on the adoption of
inter-agency guidance for regulatory capital transition and tangible common equity to assets of 8.7%. Our tangible
book value per share increased to $53.57 at the end of the quarter, up 15% from a year ago. For comparison, our
peers that have reported so far have shown an increase of 6.6%. Regulatory capital ratios are shown on slide 13.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll turn it now back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of
the call.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
I wanted to start on the balance sheet size. Even excluding the PPP deposits, deposits grew $2.7 billion quarter-
over-quarter. I'm curious what trends you're seeing so far in July in terms of deposit balances and how much of
that you'd expect to be fairly sticky or whether you're seeing any kind of outflows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
This is Mariner. We don't obviously give guidance. But I would say that the environment that we're in doesn't look
to be over any time soon and liquidity build seems to be a part of the environment we're living in. So, we don't
expect liquidity drawdowns anytime soon. We have a very, very diverse book of deposits. And I would say, during
the last crisis when we had a safety and soundness liquidity build, it stuck around largely and we continue to build
our balance sheet. It's too early I would say to determine what's going to happen. But if history is an indicator,
we've largely picked up market share rather than just temporary liquidity. It will be a combination, but I think it's
too early really to tell. But the first part of your question is what are we seeing, I would just say that we're still in
the environment and people are still building liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I think the last quarter you had suggested that you would try to put more cash on hand into the
securities portfolio. Is that still consistent looking forward from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, obviously, we want to rotate – strategically, we'd like to rotate more of that into loans and so it's just
a matter of what we're seeing with demand. In the absence of loan demand, we'll be rotating that liquidity into
securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And just on deposit cost, repricing was pretty strong this quarter. Ram, I'm curious if you had an estimate to what
kind of floor you could expect for cost or how much more room you have to go on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Go ahead, Ram.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I mean, we're at 30 basis points for the second quarter. In the month of June, we are about 28 basis
points, right? So, if you look at the last time, we were at 0 to 25 basis points on the short end of the curve. Our
deposit cost bottomed [ph] out at (00:24:21) around 18 basis points or so. Of course, that's three, four years ago,
and there have been some slight shift in our deposit mix. So, there's still some room probably on the downside for
deposit pricing based on some of the aggressive actions we're taking. But it's going to be marginal relative to the
53 basis points drop you saw in deposit cost this past quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Got it. And then last thing for me. If I look at the sensitive industry update and compare each portfolio to what was
listed last quarter, it looks like the potentially more impacted subset increased on a dollar basis and percent basis,
I think particularly in multifamily, but also some of the other categories. I'm curious what drove that, whether it's
migration from less concern three months ago to more concern now. And if so, what trends or characteristics
would have warranted more concern?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll take the high level and then Ram can see if he – if I don't pick up the whole answer for you. I mean, first of all,
the portfolio is slightly smaller, right? So, you have a percentage change related to the size of the balance sheet.
So, that's a part of it. And then the other one was really just a shift. As we spoke, we took transportation out and
put in senior housing. So, that's the overall change really there. I would say if you – in my estimation, if you take
the balance sheet size component of that, it's really a margin in the air kind of concept. It's pretty much the same
size. I would describe it as unmoved. Ram, I don't know if you want to...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No. That's exactly it. As you see in our footnote on slide 22, right, so we took away transportation as an at-risk
category and then instead this time around because of occupancy trends and what you see in the headlines about
senior living, we added that. And that differential is just about 100 basis points so that's why you see it marginally
pick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I just want to – I also want to echo that sort of our view of this concept is a little bit different than it's
being interpreted. We don't think that this group as identified means we see loss in it. It's a group of categories
that we're watching more closely. It doesn't indicate loss. So, that's also something I'd add to the description.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I appreciate the switch from transportation to senior living. But I guess, I was looking at multifamily
went from $361 million potentially more impacted in dollar balances to $463 million and I was curious if there was
any increased concern out of some of these portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Tom, do you want to take that? It's really a minor shift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Tom Terry. Some of that is just the growth in construction loans. We still have construction loans
that are advancing, so you are seeing an increase in balances. There has not been a shift in identification of, oh,
we have more that we're worried about. I think it's just the natural growth that we're seeing mainly in our
construction loans.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Mariner, in your prepared remarks, I think you characterized that the outlook for loan growth or loan demand as
robust, which is a little bit more optimistic than some of your peers. I'm interested what you're seeing in your
markets that lead to that statement and any color you could have on loan repricing would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. So, on loan growth, first of all, even in the second quarter where you see a small decrease that
obviously was mostly due to line utilization coming down. If you look at gross production, it was actually up. So,
even in the second quarter, we saw that the gross side of it coming the way we expected it to, which is negated
by utilization rates which, by the way, we see as an indication of quality. That's a positive sign of quality in the
portfolio.
As it relates to growth and looking into the next quarter, as we always do, we give a little bit of a look into the
coming quarter. And part of why we weren't any higher in the second quarter is because of coronavirus, there was
a little bit of, I call it, hesitation or slowdown in the ability to close and bring parties together and such. So, some of
second quarter has pushed into third quarter some of the growth we expected and some of the loans we identified
have pushed into the third quarter. So, that will be part of what we see in the third quarter and forward is that.
And as far as the loan growth itself, what we've always said about our loan growth is it's more about market share
gains in underpenetrated markets than it is economic activity. So, when we say we see robust loan growth, it's not

an indication of economic activity, it's more us blocking and tackling and continuing to take market share where
we have low market share in large markets. So, it's more about share gains than it is economic activity.

Appreciate it. Thank you for that. Maybe a follow-up. The ability to fine-tune branches has been emerging theme I
think with COVID. You guys have in the past been pretty proactive in terms of managing your branches. I'm
interested in kind of how you're thinking about expenses and expense management in this environment and
maybe what you've learned over the last 90 days that could lead to some synergies over time. Thanks.

Yeah. Well, I mean, I'd start by saying, we're in the middle of that. So, what I'd say is, there is absolutely change
coming, right? And we mentioned in our prepared comments some of the changes related to pickup in activity in
all of our different mobile platforms and products. So, we're seeing it. I would say what once was going to be a 10-
year process is now a 2-year process. I think the next two years will be pretty dramatic on the uptake in digital
acceptance of products and interface with the industry, with our customer base.
It's too early to tell exactly what we're going to do with that. I mean, we're deep into it. We're neck deep in
analyzing what it means and how we're going to react. And whether it's the size of a branch, what's going to take
place in a branch, will we do appointment only in the branch side and do transactions in the drive up, all these
questions that are in process, but be assured it will change, it will become more efficient. Absolutely.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's great. And maybe last one for Ram. Can you help us with the PPP outlook, the amount of fees that
are to come in and maybe the timing of how you're modeling it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. That remains to be seen, right, Chris? So, what we're modeling is very consistent what others have said,
somewhere between 60% and 80% paying off in the fourth and first quarters. That's probably the earliest that we
expect a big grudge of these forgiveness things to happen. So, probably I would say distributed evenly between
the fourth and the first quarters. I would start with 60% to 80% range.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's about 240-ish based on the median that we disclosed. Our median size on the PPP is about $56,000.
For modeling purposes, we're using about 2.4% on these balances.

Nathan J. Race Q

Hi, guys. Good morning.

Ram Shankar A

Hey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wanted to just touch on the loan modifications as disclosed in the slide deck. Just curious, as you guys are talking
to clients at this point, how much of those 10% of loans that are deferred currently are expected to need a second
deferral going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Tom, you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. At this point, we feel like the volume of requests for a second deferral so far has been very low. In our
commercial real estate book, it's been roughly 35% of those on deferral who have requested a second deferral. In
the C&I portfolio, it's been less than that. Certainly, all of that is subject to the pausing of the economy and kind of
what lays ahead over the next several weeks and months. So, that could change. But right now, we're hearing
very positive commentary from our customers and the level of requests has really slowed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And also what we have that – because that information, as you know, the note. So, from first quarter when we
talked about percentage of deferrals, those were approved and what was accepted at this point is substantially
less. Is that $1.3 billion, Tom, versus [indiscernible] (00:35:04)

$2.1 billion was approved and ultimately $1.3 billion is what got booked. So, we had a lot of clients that were
approved for a modification that ultimately said, I don't need it, and kept on paying for the contract.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, the second number that we're announcing today is more important than the first number, which is the
first number is just what we approved at the end of the last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then just thinking about the provision in the quarter, appreciate the details in the slide deck along those
lines. I guess, the qualitative effect on the provision score is a little below what we saw from some others so far in
the quarter. And it looks like you guys use a third party input from early June. So just – and I think that input
includes no second wave of COVID going forward, which I think varies by state at this point. So, just curious if we
had a more kind of current economic input into the provision and CECL model, how that would have impacted
your provision in the quarter and kind of how you guys think about provisioning at least into the third quarter as
well at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll take the high level there and, Ram, you can get in to any modeling question that we want to get into there. But
I'd first – I'm going to get my soapbox here for just a quick second. You know CECL, if you all are trying to look for
actual performance or relative try to look through the fog to figure out what credit risks actually exist in the banks.
I'm not a believer in CECL as it relates to what it actually tells us.
We're complying with CECL because it's an accounting convention we need to comply with. But it means nothing
to me as it relates to how I feel about the quality of my loan portfolio and what we pay attention to is what is
happening to our NPLs, what's happening to our charge-offs, what's happening to our past dues, what's
happening to utilization rates. And those are the things that you can actually look at across all banks to level the
information. CECL is a joke because the way every bank does it, it's different. So, it's a stupid way to analyze
what the problems are in a bank's portfolio.
So, that's how I feel about that. So, for me, what you should look at is what is our NPL coverage to allowance. For
us, it's 2.3 times against our peer group at 1.6 times, which helps understand why we're at [ph] 1.45 (00:37:51) on
coverage with the provision versus the peer group being a median at [ph] 1.65 (00:37:56). They're covering their

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
NPLs at 1.6 times. We're covering our NPLs at 2.3 times. So, those are the kinds of things I think are more
important to focus on.
And you know, what's happening to your charge-off rate, what's happening to your – your utilization rates [ph]
also (00:38:18) down significantly which means the performance of our C&I book is actually stronger than it was.
And then in your past dues, what's happened in your past dues. Those are current period forecasting outlook
things to look at that are real and tangible versus trying to forecast the impact of COVID on unemployment and
the impact – the short-term impact of 10% and 20% unemployment that happens overnight on a short-term basis
because of the disease or a virus. And what that impacts would be on the economy nine quarters from now.
It's an obscene and absurd way to think about credit quality. So, that's how I think about that, but so, stepping
back into that, we're using Moody's and we're using [ph] BBB (00:39:10) corporate spreads and the data that we
deploy is right in line with Moody's and right in line with BBB corporate spreads. And that's the information that
was spit out, gave you the macro piece of our provision for the quarter, which is I think about what $9 million for
the quarter, [ph] a minor effect. We are on that (00:39:35). Our total provision is $21 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:39:38). Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
$8.1 million, yeah. If you look at page 27 on the slide deck, it's $8.1 million and that's all spit out from the model
and using our data that we would update the model – using our data for our portfolio to update those macro
effects to do the qualitative side. [indiscernible] (00:40:00) that's my take. You didn't ask for all that, but I'm kind of
frustrated by having to be compared to other banks, COVID, macroeconomic, nonsense, that's all over the board
and it's just silly, because it doesn't have anything to do it anyway. So, that's my take on it.

Hi, guys. Appreciate all the color on CECL. That's certainly helpful. But maybe switching over to the commercial
loan book, have those utilization rate stabilized? And in your commentary for a robust loan growth in the third
quarter, is any of that coming from the commercial base?

Can you ask that again? I've...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, looking at the utilization rates in the commercial book, have those started to stabilize at the 31%? And then as
you look at the robust loan growth commentary for the third quarter, is any of that being driven by the commercial
book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, the utilization rate is it's hard to tell what it will be on a prospective basis because that will be based on things
that will have to unfold. But this would be more in line with our historic utilization rates where we are now. So,
that's it's sort of in line with a backward looking utilization rate as far as what – how it will play into loan growth in
the next quarter given the fact that it's kind of stabilized the historic levels, it's less likely to be a drag but probably
not going to play much in the way of what kind of growth we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Understood. And then one more for me. Looking at the deferrals, can we have the break out of those
deferred for 90 days versus six months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
You got that. I guess, Tom, we have that down on the slide there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The – so, on page – slide 29, the business banking category, those are all done on six-month deferrals.
The vast majority of everything else was done on a 90-day interest-only basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And so I guess for the business banking clients as the deferral period is going on, how much visibility are
you getting into that sub-segment? Is there an offset gives you kind of cautious optimism coming out of this, or is
this going to be more of a situation then until that deferral period end that's going to be really hard to gauge what
the outcome is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Go ahead Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The majority of that business banking segment are practice finance loans largely to dentists. And so you
can really track quite early with when the dental offices open back up and they're allowed to do more elective-type

procedures which they are today. Then we're optimistic that at the end of the deferral period they should be able
to get back to a normal payment structure.
The unknown clearly is if we fall back into a lockdown of some sort that changes. But you kind of follow the dentist
and for the first 30 and close to 60 days of this, they were shut down entirely except for emergency-type
procedures. So, we're optimistic that as the economy slowly opens back up and the dental practices continue to
be able to do the elective-type procedures that they'll be able to come off the deferral at the end of the agreement.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the follow-up. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the trajectory of service charges.
We've heard from most banks that the elevated cash and liquidity is obviously in lower transactions are just
weighing on that, but interested in kind of that progression over the course of April, May, June.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A

You've got that Ram or Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Well, this is Jim Rine. On the service charges, we saw an uptick in the first quarter related to one-time event, but
we're seeing primarily the same thing but most are as part of service charges actually on the decline. But they're
consistent with earnings credit, more cash on balance sheet. So, that particular line item certainly is going to see
some pressure, but it's not through loss of business or other market actions that are causing that other than
increased offset.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A

So, relatively stable at this point with some sort of industry pressure based on just trends, right? But there's
nothing underneath the hood on it.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one quick one on the hotel portfolio, could you maybe comment on occupancy rates in your
portfolio, in kind of where those need to be for kind of breakeven for some of your borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, it's – I mean the first answer is it's just under 50% and we mostly have limited service as you know within
the portfolio. As far as breakeven, I'm not sure that's something – you know, Tom, was that something we have
for [indiscernible] (00:46:31)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
It's not off top. We don't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't have that. We – that's something maybe we can address later, but it's about 50%, just under 50%
occupied in portfolio. We feel relatively good. I mean it's certainly something that we're watching closely. But
again, it's a 100% guaranteed portfolio with large liquid sponsors and it's the limited service hotels.
So, I don't have all the other loaded expenses to deal with, et cetera. The limited service tend to outperform or
tending to outperform the other categories. And again, feeling pretty good about, about where we are there and
maybe we can address in the future quarters the breakeven. I'm sure it's obviously different from hotel to hotel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just a quick one on the deferral process for hotels. Some banks are
kind of were requiring more equity to get that deferral. How did the deferral process work specifically for your hotel
borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take that. You have to also start out on the basis that the hotel deals that we have done started out at
lower loan to cost, lower loan to value generally with strong sponsors. So, we just – we didn't require across the
board additional equity. In some cases we did. But as a rule, we just would go ahead and do the deferral. But
again we're going into these I think in a stronger position than perhaps some of our brethren.

up any market share in that business as well?

...to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think the only thing I would add is that because we are a strong player in the alternative space, the asset values
hold up better than the alternative side than they do in the liquid market side, if they don't reprice the same way.
So, they hold better than [ph] how we used to hold (00:50:11) better. And we have also seen new business.
So, combination of continued new business along with a heavier reliance on [ph] alt (00:50:23) with less volatility
and the way the assets are priced has been helpful. And lastly, you asked about market share gains because of
the industry. We have seen the pipeline grow because of the consolidation and what we've learned from talking to
our teams is that when the consolidation takes place, the pipeline goes into suspense basically.
And so, anything that has been in the pipeline within other larger consolidation basically becomes more alive for
us. And so, our pipeline has been growing because of the consolidation. So, those are the kind of the three
combinations along with our custody business has been – we've hired some people, added some of the big
players. So, we're starting to see some strength on just pure institutional custody side. Largely again, the fallout
from the consolidation, we picked up several really key people to help just build the custody, institutional custody
side of the loan.
