President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. It is truly an honor and a privilege to talk to you today for the first
time as the CEO of Synchrony. Building on our strong foundation, I believe Synchrony is exceptionally well-
positioned for this next chapter of our growth journey. There is strong momentum in the business, driven by the
ongoing implementation of our strategy, and the unwavering hard work and commitment of our people.
While this past year has been challenging and unprecedented in many ways, we are starting to see positive signs
of recovery and we are seeing the benefits of the strategic initiatives that we accelerated in the new programs that
we launched last year. I am very optimistic and excited about the opportunities ahead, and I'm honored to lead
Synchrony into the future.
And with that, I'd like to get into some of the highlights of our first quarter results. Earnings were $1 billion or $1.73
per diluted share, an increase of $1.28 over last year. The resilience of our business has been evident as we
navigated the pandemic. From the underlying fundamentals of our business, including diverse programs and
networks and solid underwriting to our ability to quickly adapt to meet the moment with easily integrated seamless
digital solutions, we have demonstrated that our business is structured to execute even in the most challenging
operating environments. And as we begin to emerge from this challenging period, we have seen many of our
growth drivers outperform pre-pandemic levels experienced during the first quarter of last year.
Importantly, purchase volume increased a strong 8% over last year with a substantial increase in purchase
volume per account of 18%.While we're seeing strong trends on purchase volume, loan receivables were down
7% to $76.9 billion, given elevated payment rates with the infusion of additional stimulus this quarter, though
average balances per account have rebounded, increasing 1% over the first quarter of last year, as have new
accounts, which were up 3%.
Net interest margin was down 117 basis points to 13.98%, as further stimulus continued to elevate payment rates,
which lowered our receivable mix and yield. The efficiency ratio was 36.1% for the quarter. We are on track with
our strategic plans to reduce our expense base, removing $210 million of expenses by the end of the year.
Credit continued to perform exceedingly well with net charge offs of 3.62% this quarter compared to 5.36% last
year. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet,
deposits were down $1.9 billion or 3% versus last year. Given our excess liquidity, we have been slowing our
overall deposit growth.
Total deposits comprised 81% of our funding as our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source.
Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to depositors and we will
continue to build out additional capabilities.
During the quarter, we returned $328 million in capital through share repurchases of $200 million and $128 million
in common stock dividends. We continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities across our platforms, but

we are being very disciplined around risk and returns and it is critical to ensure that our partnerships are
structured with strong alignment that benefits both parties.
Having said that, as we previously announced, we will not renew our partnership with the Gap as we were not
able reach terms that made sense for our company. We expect that exiting this partnership and redeploying the
capital will be EPS neutral relative to current program economics and accretive to proposed renewal terms.
We have been on a journey to grow with partners who leverage our digital capabilities to help them drive sales
and meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers. Our ability to win programs with transformational digital
innovations has been demonstrated with a number of recent wins, and these capabilities are also integral to the
success of all of our programs as consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce
and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our vast digital assets as well as
our strong data analytics capabilities to make the entire consumer experience more personalized and meaningful.
We have continued to expand our digital penetration across the customer journey, from apply to buy, to servicing.
Approximately 60% of our applications were done digitally during the first quarter and we grew 14% in mobile
channel applications. In Retail Card, 50% of our sales occurred online and approximately 65% of payments were
made digital.
The investments we are making in digital and data analytics continue to pay off. During the quarter, we renewed
10 programs, including American Eagle, Ashley HomeStore, CITGO, and Phillips 66. We also added 10 new
programs, including Prime Healthcare, Mercyhealth and Emory Healthcare, which furthers our penetration of
health systems. And we are also expanding the utility of our CareCredit card. Our Patient Financing app is now
available on the Epic App Orchard. This makes CareCredit available to hundreds of health care organizations
using Epic's MyChart and enabling card holders to use CareCredit to pay co-pays, deductibles and medical
expenses not covered by insurance.
Not only does this technology integration provide a way to increase usage and acceptance of CareCredit, but also
helps health services and hospital providers to run efficient, financially healthy organizations by helping to
improve revenue cycle management and reduce debt risk. We are excited by the prospects to support patients
beyond elective care as we expand to offer payment options for non-elective medical expenses in routine care.
I'll spend a few minutes today outlining our CareCredit strategy and providing a framework to think about the
opportunities that lie ahead. Over the last several years, we've been transforming CareCredit to become a more
comprehensive solution for consumer financing and payments in healthcare, pet care and wellness by expanding
our relationships with providers, retailers, payers and pharmacies.
We have unparalleled scale and depth in this space, with $9.3 billion in receivables and acceptance at
approximately 250,000 enrolled provider, health and wellness retail locations. The card is used by more than 8
million cardholders. We are in more than 80% of dental offices nationwide and over 40 healthcare specialties, 13
of which we entered into since 2018.
We see big opportunity in health systems and hospitals and have rapidly expanded our reach by launching eight
new programs in 2020, bringing our total to 13. With the growth in our pet vertical, we are now in over 85% of vet
practices and have grown pets in force by 174% since our acquisition of the Pets Best insurance business two
years ago.

A big part of our success is the engagement we have with our cardholders. Our cardholders give us high marks
as we have increased our customer satisfaction score to 92% from 78% back in 2009.
Our Net Promoter Score is nearly double the credit card industry average. And as proof of the value our
cardholders place on the card, we've been able to increase our repeat sales to nearly 60%. That is a testament to
the hard work that we've put in to creating a strong value proposition for the card and for increasing utility as we
build our network, one office and provider at a time.
And our growth numbers reflect these efforts and the position we hold in the space. Our receivables have
increased 44% in seven years. We have also increased the breadth of our business with an increase in provider
locations to 41% in that timeframe, and active accounts currently stand at 5.7 million, another double-digit
increase in seven years.
We have built an incredible platform for growth and we are in an enviable position as we chart the course forward,
continuing to evolve to capture further opportunity. There's still tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock
growth in dental, veterinary and specialty industries. We are making investments to simplify the customer and
provider experience and leveraging technology to support more consumer-driven self-service capabilities. We
have ample room for growth with increased penetration among our existing partners and through innovation to
make it increasingly easy to engage with our network.
Just recently, we acquired Allegro Credit, which has both deepened our penetration in audiology and other
industries, while also enabling new products and capabilities. With a steady increase in out-of-pocket healthcare
costs and the popularity of high-deductible healthcare plans, consumers are assuming more of the financial
responsibility for their healthcare. This translates to a significant opportunity of more than $405 billion in out-of-
pocket health expenditures in the US, but flexible and extended financing is only a small component of overall
healthcare payments, so there is significant runway for growth.
We're also expanding beyond the traditional CareCredit industries and capitalizing on the evolving healthcare
landscape that has increased focus on overall wellness. We have moved beyond elective care financing and now
support patients by enabling them to pay for non-elective medical bills, planned procedures and routine medical
care as we expand into health systems and more healthcare specialties. This will be enhanced by ongoing
integrations with practice management software and the recent news about CareCredit becoming available
through Epic's App Orchard.
Further, we have expanded our utility, creating more ways to access healthcare services by partnering with
pharmacies. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 17,000 pharmacies nationwide, and we recently
announced that we will become the issuer of the Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the US, the first
such credit program in the retail health sector, and expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021.
We are also transforming our pet business to be a more comprehensive financial solution provider and to meet
the needs of pet parents throughout their pet care journey. Now more than ever, Americans are invested in their
pets, with both pet ownership and cost increasing significantly over the past several years, and that trend grew
even more during the pandemic. Americans spend more than $100 billion on pet expenditures. There is a large
market outside of vet practices with significant opportunity to provide new products, financing alternatives and
services.
CareCredit supports a lifetime of care for pets, and with the acquisition of Pets Best Insurance, we currently offer
a complementary solution with veterinary care to support pet owners with simple, flexible financial options. We
5

continue to integrate the Pets Best Insurance offering to capitalize on the payment and customer experience
synergies, and we're also looking for ways to expand into other pet adjacencies through products and services in
retail.
By focusing on the needs of our partners and customers and bringing substantial scale and expertise, we believe
we will drive royalty to the CareCredit network and, as a result, should see outsized growth in the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This is an important period of time for our company and the world as
we continue to emerge from the pandemic. Our business and the actions we've taken over the past year leave us
well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities which lie ahead of us. I share Brian's sentiment of
appreciation on the unwavering commitment of our people. I want to thank all those involved in development,
delivery and administration of vaccines to help us emerge from this incredibly difficult period of time. I'll now
provide an update on our first quarter results.
The pandemic and resulting government stimulus actions have impacted several key areas of our business over
the past year. However, our business mix has helped us to mitigate some impact from the pandemic as certain
areas have performed very well, including digital, home-related products and services, veterinary services,
electronics and appliances. Performance in these areas have provided support against the overall effects of the
economic downturn. As we exit the first quarter, we are starting to see greater signs of economic recovery more
broadly.
Purchase volume increased 8% versus last year and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. From a
macroeconomic perspective, we have seen consumer confidence reach a one-year high in March, unemployment
continued to improvement, and easing of some of the remaining local restrictions. This is evident in the increase
in purchase volume per account, which is up 18% over last year.
Average active accounts were down 8%, which marks a slowing in the rate of decline that remains impacted by
the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic in 2020 and uneven recovery in the first quarter. We did originate
over 5 million new accounts, an increase of 3% versus first quarter 2020, which is a positive sign and reflective of
improved consumer sentiment.
Loan receivables declined 7%, which is worse than our expectations. The driver was higher than expected
elevation in payment rates, which resulted primarily from the recently enacted stimulus. Interest and fees on loans
were down 14% from last year, driven by the elevated payment rate in addition to lower delinquencies. Dual and
co-branded cards accounted for 38% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 6% in the prior
year.
On a loan receivable basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. Overall,
we saw positive momentum in several of our growth metrics this quarter, where higher payment rates is impacting
loan receivable growth. While we're still cautious about the state of the pandemic with the recent rise in confirmed
cases, we are encouraged by the progress made with the national rollout of the vaccine and lifting of some of the
remaining restrictions. We remain optimistic of the positive momentum and continuing improvement as we
progress through 2021.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
RSAs increased $63 million or 7% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.1% for the
quarter. This was elevated from the historical average primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-
offs. We reduced our loan loss reserves this quarter due to an improved macroeconomic outlook, combined with
the decline in loan receivables.
This, coupled with lower net charge-offs, resulted in significant decrease in the provision for credit losses of $1.3
billion or 80% from last year. Other income increased $34 million, mainly due to investment income. Other
expense decreased $70 million or 7% from last year due to lower operational losses and lower marketing costs,
partially offset by an increase in employee costs.
Moving to our platform results on slide 9, our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to
the pandemic restrictions and elevated payment rates. Their trajectories have been different based on factors
such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hard line goods. We
have seen broad-based momentum in purchase volume as consumers become increasingly confident as we
begin to exit the pandemic.
In Retail Card, loan receivables declined 9%, but showed momentum with purchase volume increasing 11%
versus last year. Average active accounts were down 7% and interest and fees were down 16% due to the impact
from the pandemic.
We're excited with our renewal of the American Eagle program and continue to see significant opportunity with
our recently launched programs with Verizon and Venmo as those programs begin to build. The strength of our
Power Sports and Home Specialty and Payment Solutions continue to help offset some of the impact from
pandemic shutdowns and higher payment rates.
During the quarter, loan receivables declined 1% and average active accounts were down 9%. Interest and fees
were down 11%, which was driven primarily by lower late fees, finance charges and merchant discount, all the
resulted reduction in loan receivables.
We did see positive momentum in purchase volume, which was up 3% over last year. Our focus on growing this
platform resulted in several new programs being signed and renewing key partnerships including Ashley Home
Furniture during the quarter. We continue to drive organic growth through our partnerships and networks and
added over 3,900 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now
stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas.
Although CareCredit sustained the largest overall impact from the pandemic restrictions, improvement in this
platform has continued into 2021 as providers have increased elective and planned services from the trough in
the second quarter of last year. This improvement is evident in our purchase volume being flat to last year.
Loan receivables were down 8% this quarter and drove a decrease in interest and fees on loans of 7% as we
recorded lower late fees and merchant discounts. During the quarter, we continued to grow our CareCredit
network and enhanced the utility of our card. The expansion of our network and acceptance strategy has helped
us drive the reuse rate to 59% of purchase volume in the first quarter. This is a powerful growth platform for our
business and we remain excited about the opportunities to drive future growth as the impact from the pandemic
subsides.
I'll move to slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, recently enacted
stimulus contributed to an elevation of payment rates, which were up about 2 percentage points on average
7


Synchrony Financial

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
compared to the average payment rates we experienced pre-pandemic. The difference was as high as 3.5
percentage points in March, when the most recent stimulus plan was enacted. This has resulted in a reduction in
loan receivables, which has had an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter.
Net interest income decreased 12% from last year, driven by lower finance charges and late fees. The net interest
margin was 13.98% compared to last year's margin of 15.15%, largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on
loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the loan receivables yield of
19.32% was down 135 basis points versus last year and was a primary driver of 117-basis-point reduction in our
net interest margin.
The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over 3 percentage points from 81.7% to
78.6%, driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 61 basis points of the net interest
margin decline.
The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 23 basis points reduction in
our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by a 93 basis point decrease in the total interest-
bearing liabilities cost to 1.57%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 78 basis point increase
in our net interest margin.
We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset
growth and slowing payment rates should result in higher interest and fee yields, leading to increasing net interest
margin.
Next, I'll cover key credit trends on slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with the
delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.83% compared to 4.24% last year. Our 90-plus
delinquency rate was 1.52% compared to 2.10% last year. Higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency
improvements.
Focusing on net charge-off trends, our net charge-off rate was 3.62% compared to 5.36% last year. Our reduction
in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior
improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was
12.88%.
Moving to slide 12, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were down $70 million or 7% from
last year to $932 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs. Specifically, the
decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs, partially
offset by higher employee costs.
The efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 36.1% compared to 32.7% last year. The ratio was negatively
impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was
partially offset by a reduction in expenses.
Moving to slide 13, given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to
carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain
and volatile periods, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate.
As a result of this strategy, there's a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined by
$1.9 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.1 billion. This resulted in
8


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 79% last year, the securitized funding comprising 9% and
unsecured funding comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit
facilities, was $28 billion, which equated to 29.2% of our total assets, up from 25.3% last year.
Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the
transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits. First, it delays the
effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, it allows for a portion of the
current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.
With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 310 basis points
above last year's level of 14.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.3% under the CECL transition rules compared to
15.2% last year. The total capital ratio increased 320 basis points to 19.7%. And the Tier 1 capital, plus reserve
ratio, on a fully phased-in basis increased to 28.7% compared to 24.1% last year, reflecting the increase in the
reserves as a result of implementing CECL.
During the quarter, we returned $328 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases
and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Given the continued uncertainty in the operating
environment, I thought it'd be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for 2021,
which we've laid out on slide 14.
Our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the
second quarter, with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the
economic recovery.
First quarter purchase volume was stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year, as local restrictions are
lifted with consumer confidence improving, so do consumers' willingness to spend. We currently believe these
trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms.
In the second quarter, we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns. In the second half, we
anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates.
Regarding loan receivable growth, we expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates and
therefore, loan receivables into the next quarter.
In the second half of 2021, we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and we
return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns. Combining this with the expected increase in
purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment, this should contribute to loan receivable
growth.
For net interest margin, we expect the higher payment rates will continue to pressure loan receivables and
generate excess liquidity, impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix. We continue to believe that excess
liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates in the second half of the year, which will
drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increase in net interest margin.
With respect to credit, delinquencies are expected to increase from their current levels. So we now believe the
peak will occur later than we anticipated, likely in early 2022. While current delinquencies will result in lower net
charge-offs in the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies
as we move through 2021.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Given the magnitude of the stimulus that was deployed during the pandemic, we believe the overall loss curve will
be flatter than we initially thought, but it remains volatile and difficult to forecast into the effects of the stimulus and
industry forbearance has abated.
We expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth, impacts from any changes in credit and in our
macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases
this year.
We expect RSAs to remain elevated into the second quarter, primarily reflecting strong program performance,
including an improvement in net charge-offs, partially offset by lower revenue. In the second half of the year, we
continue to expect lower RSAs generally, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue.
As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization. And I'm pleased to report
that we are on a pace to achieve our expense savings target of $210 million for the full year. Partially offsetting
these cost reductions will be the expense increases [ph] for any growth (00:28:53) in addition to anticipated
increase in delinquent accounts.
We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic
environment.
At the foundations, it's our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the
economic recovery takes from the hold. Further, we've made the investments to support our partners as they've
been required to rapidly transform their businesses to meet the new digital realities. And we'll continue to make
investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure the
safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts.

Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick overview of key themes for the quarter and then turn it over so we can begin
Q&A.
Clearly, the pandemic has had significant impacts and has, in many ways, changed the way we do business. This
quarter made it evident that we are beginning to emerge on the other side of this period. Consumer sentiment has
improved, the unemployment rate has dropped and US retail posted the largest gain in 10 months.
Our business is showing its resilience as growth has accelerated with purchase volume up 8% and 5 million new
accounts opened this quarter. And although the solid growth metrics were tamped down by higher payment rates,
which impacted loan receivables and NIM, these are headwinds that we anticipate will soon abate.
Credit performance has continued to outperform and we continue to expand our CareCredit network, delivering
new products, financing alternatives and experiences with a focus on overall wellness and pet. The bottom line is
that we demonstrated that we were able to rapidly adapt to operate in a new environment, while continuing to
keep our eye on the long-term, positioning ourselves well for the future, and in my opinion, we have never been in
a stronger position.
I'll now turn the call back to Jennifer to open the Q&A.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Brian, I was hoping that you could talk just a little bit about the – about this return to normalcy with
respect to things like late fees and how that's impacted the net interest margin and the timing, as well as perhaps
the prepay speeds, like, what are the actual, besides the injections of stimulus, the ongoing effects, like, how
should we think about the timeframe for both of those to get back to something approximating normal. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Moshe, and good morning. So, yeah, clearly, we've seen the headwind relative to stimulus. We saw the
cash flow really start back in mid-March around the [indiscernible] (00:32:29) stimulus started to hit. So from
there, we continue to see elevated payments. They are starting to trend down a little bit now as we get into latter
part of April. Obviously, we have a converging factor with tax returns. So stimulus, clearly, is the number one
factor.
When you think about the late fee yield, if you went back and looked at our number of delinquent accounts,
they're down over 30% from the 2019 period, so pre-pandemic. So, again, as you think about a rising net charge-
off, or even just the return to normalcy when you think about the charge-off environment, that late fee yield will
come back into the book and come in, in advance of when the charge-offs actually hit. So we would expect to see
that yield begin to increase in the back half of the year.
What I'd say, Moshe, is a lot of people focus on the margin of the business. We're at 14% today. We've kind of
guided people to, call it, the 16% range in a normalized environment. If you break down the components of that
for a second, the first piece is really the excess liquidity, which I started with, with the stimulus factors, right.
So if you went back and looked at excess liquidity, pre-pandemic, applied that to the book today, you'll probably
pick up about 90 basis points of net interest margin from there. We previously talked about, there's probably 25 or
so basis points, 30 basis points in the benchmark rates, which we'll see how prime comes. And the residual
amount, right, which is the mainly late fee yield and interest yield, will come back into the book and that will rise.
So I think you can see a trajectory where this begins to accelerate in the back half of the year and begins to
approach normalcy for us as we move into 2022.

Yeah. Moshe, this is Brian Doubles. I think we would certainly expect that number to continue to grow. We're not
in a fully open economy right now, as you know. I think there's – look, there's a lot of reasons to be bullish. When
you look at the consumer, you look at the trends on jobs, unemployment back to 6%. I think consumer balance
sheets are strong and they're starting to spend again. I think the fact that we saw 8% purchase volume growth
and 11% of retail card is a really positive indicator, but that's not where it should be in a fully functioning open
economy. And so I think there's still room across all the growth metrics to go further from here. We're still in the
early innings in terms of a recovery, but most of the trends that we're seeing are pretty positive.
The fact that we grew purchase volume per account up 18% is a really good indicator that consumers are
spending again. And I do think that will turn into more revolving behavior over time. I mean, the effects of the
stimulus, as Brian said, are going to – they're going to wane over time. I think you're going to start to see that
pretty soon as the confidence gets better, you tend to see consumers take on more debt and revolve a little bit
more, which will help on balances and margins as well.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
The only thing I'd add, Brian, is as you think about the new account originations, we haven't touched the credit
box.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
I do think as we begin to continue to move through the year, we are making credit refinements to expand credit,
but we haven't done that in acquisition. So that will also provide a tailwind as we move throughout the year,
Moshe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
And then, Moshe, just on Venmo and Verizon, a lot to be excited about on both of those programs. Venmo, it's
still early, but we're ahead of our expectation in terms of new accounts and spend. The feedback from customers
on the card has just been phenomenal. They love the val prop, and the fact that it automatically optimizes the
rewards for the spending categories where you're spending the most. They love the card design, the QR code. So
the feedback has just been terrific.

And then Verizon, which is a little bit further along, I'd say, we're seeing really good purchase volume. It's
definitely behaving like a top-of-wallet card, which is what we wanted. So, so far so good on both, and I continue
to believe that both can be top 10 programs for us in the future.

Operator: We have our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just want to follow-up on the comments on loan growth. I guess, when I think about your
framework and outlook for the year, do you feel like you're more constructive on loan growth as we look out for
the rest of the year? And then, just specifically to that offline recovery, are you guys anticipating an offline
recovery, because it would seem like it would impact that loan growth more significantly than others?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yes. Good morning, Sanjay. Yeah. As we think about loan growth here, we entered the quarter optimistic on the
positioning. As we exit the quarter, we're probably a bit more optimistic than that. So we've seen broad-based
recovery. When you look at retail card up 11%, that is both the expansion of digital as well as some of the, as you
call them, offline retailers kind of coming into play.
I think, from a receivables standpoint, we are seeing strong volume. Some of that is obviously buoyed by the
stimulus dollars that came in, in March, but we saw strength across each of the months in the quarter. So, it
outperformed what our expectations are.
And as I think about loan growth, I think you probably will see an inflection point here in the second quarter and
acceleration into the back part of the year. So I do think you'll see positivity come through the portfolio. And again,
we have the tailwinds that still existed in the CareCredit platform, right, as you have dental implant services
opening up and you still have the supply chain issues in the Payment Solutions platform. So there's a lot of
tailwinds that are in place besides what we've already seen.
So, again, we're optimistic about where we are and how the second quarter will play out and what we've seen to
date in the quarter, and then how the back half of the year looks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q

some aggressive pricing type stuff. I mean, how do you think that affects the future pipeline? And are you seeing
deals in your pipeline that look interesting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. Look, I think this was a bit of a unique situation. I'd say we had a really good partnership
for a number of years. We had great feedback actually from the client on our partnership model, our products, our
capabilities. And I think, at the end of the day, this one just came down to terms and price, and our competition
was just a lot more aggressive on both.
There were some, I would call them really out of market terms, where they were looking for guaranteed revenue
that increased annually regardless of how the program performed. And for context, just given the turnaround that
they've been working through, the program had been shrinking. And so there's really only so far you could go to
guarantee those types of payments on a program like that.
So, look, we tried to reach an agreement. At the end of the day, there just wasn't a way for us to get our interests
aligned, but I do think this is a pretty unique situation. I look at the pipeline today across all three platforms. We've
got really attractive opportunities with very strong partners at attractive returns where our interests are aligned.
And I think that is so important. We talked about this for a number of years. We want programs where our
interests are aligned and growing the program. We're doing that in a way that benefits both parties.
So, I still feel really good about the pipeline as I look across all three platforms.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Brian, you're running at 17.4% CET1. If I look at this quarter, you earned over $1 billion. Reserves are likely
coming down. And even with the return to growth, you're likely to accrete quarter – capital in the coming quarters,
even using the existing $1.6 billion buyback. So I was wondering maybe could you just talk about the strategy for
getting CET1 back towards peer levels. And is there the potential for you to revisit your capital return as for the
coming quarters? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So, obviously, in the first quarter, we repurchased $200 million of shares in the quarter that
was part of the $1.6 billion we announced in the early part of January. And just to put that frame of reference,
obviously, when we went to the board and discussed with the board, that authorization that was in the December
timeframe off the models. As we move through the quarter, clearly, we have more information. We've updated our
scenarios. We submitted our capital plan to the Fed in March and look forward to their feedback later this quarter.
So, obviously, we'll see what the results of that come back, but we're optimistic with regard to their support for our
capital plan. It's not lost on us that we have the excess capital, Ryan. In the second quarter, we'll again be subject
to the limitations by the Fed which will cap us out around $390 million for the current quarter with regard to the
amount of repurchases that we can do. I would make the presumption we will be, depending upon market
conditions, at that maximum. And then we'll be back to you and talk about the capital plan that we submitted back
to the Fed.
That being said, to the extent that the income profile of the business changes, we have not, in that capital plan,
dealt anything with Gap, and if that portfolio conveys that we would potentially revisit that and go back to the Fed,
if it's warranted. So we'll continue those discussions and dialogues with the board and most certainly with our
regulators. So there is an opportunity.
With regard to your cadence question, clearly, we want to get back to our long-term goal being in line with peers,
and we'll do that as prudently as possible, but obviously, we want to do it with the support of all our constituents.
They're not barriers to doing it. We just want to do it in a prudent fashion. And most certainly, we're not totally
done with the pandemic here, but we'll move as prudently as possible to execute that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe just as a [ph] sanity (00:43:48) check, a follow-up to Moshe's question. How should we think
about the pacing of NII improvement relative to the pacing of loan growth given all the dynamics on margin and
the normalization of credit over time? As we see these factors abating, should we see NII materially outpacing
loan growth as we normalize? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. I would probably think they're more moving in sequence as of – in the early part of this quarter. As you get
to the back part of the year, when you start seeing the late fee yield come in, you may see the NII accelerate a
little bit faster. But it will really depend upon that delinquency formation, Ryan.

Hi. Good morning.

President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
A couple of questions. Just on the capital targets, could you just give us a sense as to where you think optimized
is for you over the next cycle here? And part of the reason for the question is I'm trying to understand how you're
going to be thinking about your capital to fund loan growth. Or on the flip side, do you feel like your loan growth
can be fully funded by the liquidity mix shift? So just give us some color there would be helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Let me with the latter part of your question. Clearly, the excess liquidity we have, we believe, sustains us
with the loan growth that we see coming to the portfolio, which, again, gets back to a more normalized level back
half of the year. We've talked about a potentially acceleration into 2022 as there's pent up demand. And we
believe the excess liquidity is ample enough to support that. And most certainly, with the earnings power of the
business that we expect this year from a capital standpoint, we should be able to support it.
With regard to the first part of your question, with regard to those targets, I mean, we talked about peer targets.
So you think about the Cap Ones, the Discovers down in that 11% to 12%, maybe 10.5% range. We'll see how
the portfolio develops. We're optimistic we can get there in a reasonable period of time. I think if you go back, we
exited GE with 18%. We made it down to 14% before the pandemic hit. And we think we can get back in a fairly
16


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
reasonable period of time. And if you remember, right, before the pandemic hit, we were on a path to execute a
$3.6 billion capital plan. We're $3.3 billion into it. So we think we can deploy it fairly rapidly once we feel
comfortable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then, Brian, you were talking at the beginning of the call about CareCredit. And maybe
you could help us understand the impact of the Walgreens portfolio over time. I think you mentioned that you
could see Verizon and Venmo getting the top 10 program. Maybe you could give us a sense as to how you're
thinking about Walgreens? And then also, how should we think about CareCredit impact on RSAs? Is it similar to
the way that the retail program is run or is there any differences that we should be aware of? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Betsy. I think, look, CareCredit I think is probably the most exciting growth opportunity that we've got
in the company today, and we tried to lay that out for you in a couple of slides. I think, first, just going after a
market of this size, that's growing as fast as it is, obviously, healthcare costs are rising, high deductible plans are
increasing in popularity, so less and less is being covered by insurance. And that's really where CareCredit comes
in.
We're a big player in the space today, but financing options in this space is still a very small fraction of the
potential spend that's out there. So there is just a ton of room for growth. And I think about the growth in really
three components. One is growing the core. We're in – CareCredit's accept in about 250,000 locations today.
We're in 40 different specialties. We just entered into 10 new specialties just over the last two years. And we're in
80% of dental offices, 85% of that. So we've got a lot of scale. But with that said, there's still a lot of room to grow
penetration inside of those providers because third-party financing options is still a relatively small percentage. So
a lot of room for growth there.
And then we talked a little bit about both health systems. We're in 13 large health systems today. That's a growing
part of our business. We're paired up with big players like Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic. And then we
talked about pets as really that third leg of the strategy. We're seeing just unbelievable growth in our pet
insurance business that we bought a couple of years ago, up 174% since we bought it.
So just a lot to be excited about. And then you touched on Walgreens. We had – our CareCredit cards were
accepted at Walgreens. We expanded that relationship to launch a new program. And I think similar to Venmo
and Verizon, this can be a top 10 program for us, and we're tapping into 90 million myWalgreens customers. So
the opportunity is just huge and we're actively working to get that launched in the second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And RSA – sorry, go ahead, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
The RSA will operate similar to how you see things operate in the retail card platform. So it would be a similar
type of alignment.

Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. How are you? I guess just going a little bit more – it's clear you did emphasize
CareCredit in the prepared remarks. I'm wondering – and you talked about the scale. Maybe can you just give us
an update? I think from a competitive position perspective, you're dramatically larger than the next largest, I
mean, but maybe talk about the competitive framework. And just given the growth momentum there, how much
bigger as a percentage of, call it, loans receivables might CareCredit be over the next few years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, John. We're certainly probably the biggest player in the space that does what we do, but we have seen
competition come and go into the space over time. I love the fact that we have the scale that we have. It's taken
us decades to build this kind of scale and get embedded in 250,000 locations. So I would expect going forward to
see outsized growth in CareCredit relative to the rest of the business. So I definitely think this becomes a bigger
part of the business going forward.
We're also increasing the level of investment that we're making in CareCredit. We've invested quite a bit,
obviously, over the last 10 years. But I'd say just recently with acquisitions and pet insurance, we just recently
acquired Allegro Credit. We're definitely seeing a lot of opportunities to invest both organically and inorganically,
which I think will just accelerate the growth rate here relative to the rest of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then you guys – you cited some good trends with respect to account adds recently, but clearly, there's

some of the churn come from?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial

Operator: And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Brian, obviously, there's been a big proliferation of fintech companies. And I was just curious,
as you look at your three businesses, is there one or how would you rank them in terms of where you're watching
closer? And I'd be curious on CareCredit, it seems like that could be susceptible to fintech players maybe more so
than other areas, but I could be wrong on that. Just wanted to get your thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. No, look, I think you can't limit it to just one of the platforms. Obviously, it's a very competitive space right
now. The fintech landscape is changing every minute and we have to stay all over it across all three of our
businesses. And I think the team's doing a really good job of doing that.
So I don't think that we feel it more acutely in one area than another. I think what we tend to feel from fintechs is,
they tend to do one thing really well and that's a luxury that they have. And we are – given our scale, we have to
do a lot of things really well to compete with them, but I feel like we're doing that across all three of our platforms.
So, look, competition's good. At the end of the day, it makes us better. I don't feel like we're losing share in any of
our three platforms. We still got a lot of opportunity for growth, but it's something we got to stay all over. Our
teams watch this. They're talking to our partners. And when they see people come into the space, we're doing our
best to keep them out and solidify our relationship.
So I feel really good about we're positioned competitively, but you can never let your guard down. You got to stay
all over this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. And then in terms of not really touching credit underwriting standards, it seems like some of the peers have
started to loosen up. Are you just being cautious or do you still need to see something to get comfortable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
No. So, Don, the way I would think about it is we have started to make refinements in our credit underwriting. If
you remember, when we started back in the pandemic, we did – attaining more on proactive type of credit
extension. So we shifted the cut-off down on our private label and Dual Card product mix. We reduced the
number of proactive credit line increases. We reduced the number of invitation to apply and pre-screen type offers
on new accounts.
20


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
As we move through into 2021, what we started to do in places where we obviously have known customers, we
begun to unwind a lot of those credit refinements. So we are shifting the cut-offs, so more people can get a Dual
Card, which would be a slightly higher line, but most certainly stimulate some spend in the world.
We have begun a number of credit line increase type programs, which are customers that we've known and seen
credit behavior and payment behavior patterns. And then, we've also begun to upgrade accounts from private
label to Dual Card that would have qualified for Dual Card a year ago. So we're doing a number of things
proactively. We just have not touched – at the point of acquisition, changed any cut-offs, things like that. But,
again, we didn't do a lot of that last year. So I don't really expect us to do a lot of it – changes now, but we have
begun proactive increases. And the good news is, given our portfolio, we're able to do that with customers we
know and we're not taking incremental risk in our eyes.

Operator: Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Look, when we think about the nature of private label, there
is more, by category, concentrated behavior than you would expect to see with, for example, general purpose.
When you look forward to where there are opportunities for further recovery, how do you think the portfolio and
the opportunity indexes against that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Rick, I think probably the best way to think about it is you have to look at – I know there's – obviously, [ph]
T&Es (00:57:17) has a big pullback. We're a little bit less concentrated there, but certainly our Dual Cards will
benefit from that and our general purpose card will benefit from that. I think the fact that brick and mortar stores
are opening again. I think we're certainly well-positioned to benefit from that.
And then I think, frankly, the digital trends that we saw over the last year, while we're going to have some tough
comps, they're coming up over the next few quarters, I feel like some of that shift was certainly permanent and will
stay, and we'll benefit there as well.
So, look, if you look across the portfolio, the one thing that I think about quite a bit, and we hear this from all of our
partners, including all the providers in CareCredit, is there is a real pent-up demand, right, for pretty much
everything. This pent-up desire to spend and get back to normal. We're talking to our providers in CareCredit. And
they can't keep up with the appointments because so many people over the last year, they postponed things that
weren't critical. They didn't want to go into the practices. And now, you're seeing all of that start to flush through.

So I think regardless of the category, there is a ton of pent-up desire to spend. And I think if travel and
entertainment dining, those things come back, I think that also spurs other types of spend that we'll see both on
our Dual Cards, but also in some of our adjacencies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
I think it's also, Brian, as you kind of pointed out, we're so broad-based, when you think about inside retail card,
which is up 11% in the first quarter, I mean, think about the breadth of lifestyle/specialty groups over there. Think
about the – not only the American Eagle's, but the DICK'S Sporting Goods, when you got to value-oriented
retailers, such as Sam's Club, et cetera, TJX, that are in there, we have such a wide breadth of coverage with
regard to where spend happens. It actually is a fairly nice tailwind as we come out of this period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. And Brian, you bring up a really interesting point in terms of CareCredit and it leads to
my follow-up question, which is, do you think that there are certain categories of spend that translate naturally into
a higher percentage of borrow?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
A higher percentage of borrow, is that what you said, Rick?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. So, for example, people may be more inclined not to borrow on a gas card, but certainly if it's a larger
transaction, like you might see through CareCredit, there would be more revolve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Certainly, we would expect to see that in CareCredit with some of the bigger ticket purchases. We tend to
see really good revolve rates there. And I do think it does depend a little bit on the size of the ticket. I mean, if
somebody is getting braces for their kids, that's a big ticket item. They typically don't want to tie up their general
purpose card utility with that purchase. And that's where CareCredit comes in. And that can be done on a equal
pay installment loan. It can be done on a promotional financing product. And we tend to see really good revolve
rates there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you, guys, very much.

Operator: And we have our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to start, I was hoping you could share some
color on how you're currently thinking about just buy now, pay later. And I'm thinking more in terms of the Pay in 4
type program versus some of the larger ticket things, like Payment Solutions, where you basically have a buy
now, pay later solution. I'm thinking more just the smaller ticket Pay in 4. Just how are you thinking about it? Is
that something you're considering? Should we be expecting you to be in the market with something like that, any
timeframes that you can share there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, I can tell you, it's definitely going to be a product that we offer. We're going to have something to
market with a couple of partners later this year. Just to take a step back more broadly, our strategy is really to
provide a full suite of products. We have such a diverse array of partners that we really can have a one size fits all
strategy. We've got to be able to offer revolving products, short-dated installment, longer-term installment, equal
pay products, buy now pay later products. And we want to do that in a way that we can bring that full suite of
products to our partners and basically allow them to choose which products are best for their customers based
on, not only their customer, but what types of products are they selling.
So, not surprisingly, bigger ticket items tend to steer more towards the longer-term installment. That can be on a
revolving product or closed end. And then, smaller ticket, it tends to be shorter-term either through a product like
SetPay or a Pay in 4 type product. So that's really the strategy, provide that comprehensive suite of products, and
then take that to our partners and really allow them to select from that menu in terms of what meets their
customer needs based on the products that they're selling in their strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. And any timelines or anything – I guess I'll move on from that. I just wanted to clarify, in terms of just your
comments on loan balances; I just wanted to make sure I understood that right. Do you think loan balances have
troughed or are pretty close to troughing at this point? I guess what I'm asking is, do you see more pressure from
payment rates in 2Q or do you think that those balances start increasing from here? And if you've seen anything
in April that you'd be willing to share that would be great too. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So I think as you think about the beginning part of April, we continued to see elevated
payment rates from historical average that has tended to trail down a little bit. We expect that to burn off during
this quarter. So, with regard to a loan receivable trough, my expectation would be that we are going to trough
here. Most certainly, we have seen very strong sales in the first 20 or so days of April. So, our hope would be that
we trough here in the second quarter and begin that acceleration up.

Operator: We have our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Scharf Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Hi, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Brian, I just had one follow-up on CareCredit. Most
questions have been addressed. Can you just provide a little more maybe granularity or specificity around just
how the payment product is marketed, awareness is created for – the transitional – transition to more kind of non-
elective procedures? I'm just – I've seen CareCredit displays at vets, the counter tops of vets and other elective
outlets. But I'm trying to understand how, as a member myself of a large healthcare system, how I would even
become aware of this as a payment option? How it's going to be marketed to me?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. A lot of it is – again, we've built this business over decades and a lot of it is awareness at the point of sale.
So, when you're sitting in the waiting room for a vet appointment or dental appointment, you see the promotional
financing offer, you see CareCredit. We actually talk about it in the providers and talk about the benefits of it.
And so that's the primary channel and at least has been historically. We also have a provider locator. And what
we're trying to do is move up funnel a bit, so that at the time that you're booking your appointment, because a lot
of that is now happening online, you're actually getting – you're seeing the promotional financing offer, so that that
becomes kind of part of how you're thinking about your treatment.
So, it's not – once you actually get to your appointment that you become aware of it, you can actually go through
the whole process well in advance of your appointment and think about how you're going to pay for whether it's
braces or whatever your treatment's going to be. And we found that to be really successful.
So we've been building that brand awareness over time. It originated largely inside of a provider's office, but has
certainly expanded to be more digital in nature through direct marketing and other channels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Scharf Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
No, I see, and I believe you may have mentioned MyChart at one point. I mean, once again, just reflecting on –
particularly with the pandemic the expenses over the last [ph] few years (01:06:51). Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Getting integrated into the practice management software system is huge for us. That is a really important
aspect of the growth strategy here. And for health systems, our integration with Epic inside of the dentists and the
24

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
vets, their practice management software, regardless of what they use, we want to be completely integrated
there, so that it becomes part of the process for the office manager that's working there. And you can imagine,
with 250,000 providers, we have a wide range of big providers, small providers, and keeping CareCredit top of
mind as a payment option is really critical to the future growth of that business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Scharf Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Got it. And just one last follow-up, more program-specific on Venmo. I know you had mentioned it. It's still very
early stages. And I think you had commented it's modestly kind of exceeding kind of expectations at this time.
Can you give us a little color though on perhaps what percentage of the Venmo user base has initially been
targeted? Just trying to get – it's obviously a very younger skewing demographic. I got to believe a lot of Venmo
users have very thin credit files. Just trying to get a sense for how we should think about the opportunity there in
terms of the mix of current users.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, nothing I can provide specifically, but I mean this is a huge opportunity to tap into 70 million Venmo
customers. Obviously, they have to meet our underwriting criteria and our screen, but that's just a – it's a huge
opportunity for us. Again, no doubt, this is going to be a top 10 program. And the early returns in terms of what
we're seeing on spend and accounts is ahead of what we thought it would be. And we had – we were pretty
aspirational in terms of our expectations. So very positive even though it's only been in full launch mode for a
couple of months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
The only other thing I'd add here, this is another point of the strength that we have, Brian, right, which is the ability
to get data from our providers. So when you think about where Venmo may know a customer for a period of time,
watch the payment velocity, see how long they've been affiliated, they can pass us that information. So, it actually
helps us even though they may have a [ph] same credit or bureau (01:09:27), the richness of the data that they
have with PayPal and Venmo may be a help for us as we underwrite.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Thanks so much for taking my question. If you think about – I just want to go back to the total business and I
really appreciate all the color on CareCredit. But if we think about the CET1 and where that can go versus the
general purpose players, I think, historically, there's been a buffer between private label and general purpose
CET1s. And so do you expect that spread to close? And have you had conversations with the regulators of them
feeling comfortable with that closure? And then I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Dominick. I don't think we've had a conversation with regard to the product private label versus general
purpose. I think they look at the loss scenarios that we run, right, the stress scenarios that we run. We are – have
a very unique feature in the RSAs, which provide a buffer against some of the outlays. So I think when you look at
the output of those, we don't really view it differently than some of our competitors when you think about a capital
one for argument sake with regard to how their stress capital buffer comes out.
So we're in line with those. It's not really product-oriented. And most certainly, for us, as we have those
conversations, really demonstrating to them the resiliency of this business and this customer because of the point
of origination, we actually get stronger yields and risk-adjusted returns off. And again, when you combine that with
the RSA buffer, it provides particular strength when it comes to having a lower capital ratio. And those are the
conversations we're having with them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Makes a lot of sense. I would argue, you should be below the general purpose players to some extent because of
all those factors on a risk-adjusted basis. And then, if you think about the efficiency of the business, as we move
forward, there's obviously going to be some pressure from multiple factors on the loan book. And obviously, you
could see some good cycle growth, given some of the tailwinds of the overall economy. But when we think of
Gap, when we think about all the various factors of – the size of your loan book, how do you think about the long-
term efficiency of the business moving forward over the next few years? Is there some pressure on efficiency until
you get back to maybe your more traditional average loan book size? And is there some dynamics between the
CareCredit and the Retail Card there? Thanks so much. I really appreciate being on the call. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Dominick. So, I think the way to think about efficiency is when we went through last year, we underwent a
strategic outlook. That said, if I look out to 2025, think about the mix of business I'm going to have, think about
trying to be a top ROA profile company and I look at the revenue characteristics, the loss content characteristics,
the RSA characteristics, what is my expense and efficiency ratio have to be in order to be a top tier ROA and
ahead of all of our peers to really generate the investment thesis. We then rolled that back into the plans that we
put in place in the latter part of 2020. So I think we've engaged upon that. Part of that's delivering over $210
million of benefit this year from a cost out perspective.
I think the greater pressure on the efficiency ratio in the short-term to be honest with you is the revenue headwind
that we have with the net interest margin and NII have been a little bit impacted or being impacted by stimulus
and really terrific credit and late fee impact that comes from that. That's a little bit ahead, but I do think you're
going to see this. This business model, right, we're built off of a foundation of running expenses at a very
26

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2021
manageable level given the loan balance size. I think as you see CareCredit, our business grow, you should be
able to get operating leverage because they run at higher average balances, if you think about the bigger ticket
size associated with those accounts.
And then, what can't be lost is the fact that we don't have to spend as much on marketing as our peers relative to
generate those new accounts. So we are an industry probably best or very attractive cost to acquire customers,
which really puts us at a competitive advantage versus our peers.
So we will tightly manage the efficiency. And while we're doing this, we're going to continue to invest in the future.
The digital assets that we put in play over the last several years, we're going to continue to invest for our long-
term future. So it's a combination of investing and really having a business model and set of partners where we
can leverage it and generate that operating efficiencies. We probably grow above average with peers and have a
higher return than average versus our peers. That's how I would think about it, Dominick.
