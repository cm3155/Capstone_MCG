Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
The firm delivered a very solid quarter against, obviously, what is a more challenging backdrop. Businesses
proved resilient, reflecting an important aspect of our strategy and that is to, as we've said many times, deliver
stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining well-capitalized.
The integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients, grow
assets, and support the firm's overall stability. Net new assets in Wealth Management of over $50 billion despite
the volatility and clients' tax-related withdrawals in the quarter underscored the scale of our business and its
power to attract assets. And in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets, Wealth Management delivered a
strong PBT and improved margin, supported by the benefits of rising rates.
Investment Management benefited from its diversification and we saw continued momentum in private
alternatives, Parametric customized portfolios, and the counter-cyclicality of our money market business. Finally,
in Institutional Securities, our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helped materially counter what
everybody knows to be limited activity across investment banking.
Our results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out. First, we saw a significant
movement in the investments related to deferred cash-based compensation plans. While the marks on these
investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense, they created significant drag on top line revenues
in the quarter across the firm, particularly in Wealth Management where the impact to revenues exceeded $500
million.
Secondly, the quarter results also included the legal costs of $200 million that reflects the likely resolution of
regulatory investigations by the SEC and the CFTC regarding employees' use of unapproved personal devices
and the firm's recordkeeping requirements. This has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny.
Our ROTCE, excluding integration expenses for the deals that we've done, was 14.3%, down 20% in Q1 and from
last year. As I said at the outset, our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic
cycle was achieved this quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance in what was
otherwise a challenging environment.
Finally, the Fed's stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model. Our diversified business mix as
well as our strong capital position provide us the flexibility to invest in future growth and support our robust capital
return program. As such, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and announced a $20 billion multiyear
buyback program. Having a dividend that's aligned to the more stable earnings from Wealth and Investment
Management is a leading priority of this firm. And by the way, at today's stock price, the current dividend has a
yield of approximately 4%.
With the buyback, we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows. Given the nature of our
business model, it's especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital of what we believe to
be attractive valuations.
I'll now turn the call over to Sharon and, as always, at the end, we'll take your questions.

Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.1 billion in the second quarter. Our EPS was
$1.39 and our ROTCE was 13.8%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.44 and our ROTCE

was 14.3%. Our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against the challenging backdrop and the benefits of
a balanced business model.
The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients' evolving needs in a dynamic environment. Wealth
Management benefited from its scale and rising rates. Despite the decline in global asset prices, our expanded
product set in Investment Management proved supportive to that business. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio,
excluding integration-related expenses, was 70%. This includes the $200 million legal matter related to the firm's
recordkeeping requirements that James discussed.
Given the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment, we are focused on discretionary spend while
balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth. As
a management team, our priority is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. We will
continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective.
Now to the businesses. Institutional revenue of over $6 billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise
against a difficult market backdrop. Revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year while the
backdrop was challenging for Investment Banking, particularly underwriting. Fixed income and equities led the
strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets.
Investment Banking revenues were $1.1 billion, down significantly from the prior year. Heightened volatility led
clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity. Advisory revenues were $598 million, reflecting lower
completed M&A volume. Equity underwriting revenues declined to $148 million. Results were in line with global
equity volumes which fell meaningfully versus the prior year. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $326
million, also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investment-grade and
non-investment-grade companies. The Investment Banking pipeline remains solid. Conversion to realized will
largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence.
Equity revenues were $3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop. Prime

Our revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of $413 million. Mark-to-market losses on
corporate loans held-for-sale including event loans offset by gains on hedges were $282 million. This reflected the
widening of credit spreads. Notable declines in deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to gains in
the prior year also contributed to the decline.
Turning to ISG lending. As a reminder, over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment-grade
or secured. Our Institutional Securities Group credit portfolio continues to perform well. Our funded ratio on
corporate loans stands at approximately 11%, in line with pre-pandemic levels and well below the first quarter
2020 peak of approximately 25%.

Turning to Wealth Management. By several measures, performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop. We
reported revenues of $5.7 billion. Results were meaningfully impacted by movements in DCP, which reduced
revenues by $515 million in the quarter. Excluding the impacts of DCP, revenues increased 6% from the prior
year to $6.3 billion, a new record. The decline in DCP was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation
expense. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was robust at $1.6 billion and the margin increased to
28.2%. The margin's resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the
franchise and the benefits of our business mix, including the growth of our banking offerings.
Transactional revenues were $291 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 17%.
Lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last year's elevated levels and limited new issuance.
Self-directed daily average trades remained well above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition highs. Asset management
revenues of $3.5 billion were up modestly versus the prior year, driven by strong fee-based flows realized over
recent quarters. Fee-based flow assets were $29 billion in the quarter and fee-based assets now represent 50%
of our advisor-led assets.
Total net new assets were $53 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to $195 billion, representing a 6%
annualized growth rate. Tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarters. And yet asset
generation remains strong and balanced. NNA was driven by existing and new clients in the advisor-led channel,
stock plan vesting events, positive net recruiting, and self-directed channel inflows.
Bank lending balances grew $7 billion in the quarter, driven by securities-based lending and mortgages. We
continue to expect full-year loan growth of $22 billion. Deposits declined $12 billion in the quarter to $340 billion.
The decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of rate-sensitive cash. The outflows
were largely in line with our expectation. The average rate of deposits increased to 28 basis points. This was
driven by an increase in saving account rates and deposit mix.
Net interest income was $1.7 billion, up notably from the prior year, driven by higher rates and continued strong
bank lending growth. Looking ahead to the second quarter, NII is now a more reasonable exit rate going forward.
While the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain, if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions
materialize, we estimate $500 million of incremental NII to be spread over the upcoming two quarters weighted
towards the fourth quarter.
Turning to Investment Management. Revenues were $1.4 billion. Against a challenging public market
environment, our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix, particularly with strength in our
portfolio solutions, led by Parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offerings.
We've built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments. The benefits of these efforts
were apparent in the quarter. Total AUM was $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of $3.5 billion primarily reflect
recurring headwinds in equity strategies, but were partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions,
particularly in Parametric customized portfolios. Collaboration with our Wealth Management business as well as
other US wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings.
Liquidity net inflows exceeded $30 billion. We have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade, which
has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment. Asset management and
related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower AUM was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as
rates came off of a zero bound. Performance-based income and other revenues were $107 million in the quarter.
We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio with particular strength in infrastructure and the
5

energy sector investment. The decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in DCP and markdowns on
public investments.
Overall, our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. We have seen early success in leveraging
our global distribution across our combined businesses.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets declined 4% from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our
standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs notably
decreased to $461 billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses
amid a market decline. The result was a reduction in RWAs of $40 billion. OCI related to our available-for-sale
securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of $1.1 billion. While this should be earned back
over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. Our supplementary leverage
ratio was 5.4%.
During the second quarter, we completed our $12 billion buyback plan that we announced last year. The most
recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model and we announced a dividend increase of
11% and a $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict, we are focused on our underlying
business drivers. Lower asset values will impact revenue in both Wealth and Investment Management. However,
in Wealth Management, rising rates are already driving NII higher, supporting performance, and net new assets
remain healthy in Investment Management. The diversification across fund strategies should continue to support
results.
What we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our
Institutional Securities business. However, our competitive positions remain strong and we remain close to our
clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment.
With that, we will now open the line up to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon, James, I guess, and then good morning, Sharon. Maybe I'd start on the macro.
James, it's a very confusing time on the macro front. There are some positives, but a ton of headwinds. I mean,
obviously, this quarter was unusually noisy for Morgan Stanley and I think you kind of put up your lowest ROE in
almost two years. So, just curious how you're thinking about the macro backdrop, how is MS positioned for that
backdrop, maybe how you think about your pathways to achieve some of your longer-term targets in the current
backdrop. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Thanks, Christian. I think you hit it on the head. The environment, if I had to use one word to describe it, it
would be complicated. We have the Russian invasion in the Ukraine, obviously, a historic occasion. We have
historically low rates with very significant rate increases going around the world. We've got the tale of COVID.
We've got obviously the fears of inflation and actual inflation. We've got enormous political change just here in this
country, the UK where I am at the moment, they had leadership change a few days ago, supply chain issues,
China-US relations, et cetera. So, yeah, very complicated.
I think it's important to say, though, it is not 2008 complicated. This is a different type of financial stress in the
system and, frankly, the banking sector is much stronger than it was going into the last time we went through a
major reset in 2007/2008. Morgan Stanley is in particular – I won't speak for others, but we're specifically in much
better shape. We're along the US in our businesses largely because Wealth Management is almost entirely US.
And the US is yet again sort of a great region to be in in the world. And yes, while we might head into some form
of recession and I, like many others, have tried to handicap it, but we're frankly guessing at this stage, but I think
it's unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the US. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how
COVID rolls out and it's sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe, obviously, is fighting the
hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine, because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on.
So, when I look at Morgan Stanley, to sort of add it all together, we did exactly what we wanted to do this quarter.
Yes, it's the lowest ROE for a couple of years after I think three consecutive record years. But, hey, this is the
most difficult environment we've been in decades. So I'm okay with a lower ROE particularly when it has a ten
handle on it. We have CET1 capital ratios of 200 basis points above our requirement. Our ROTCE was nearly
14%. If you look at the Wealth Management margins, we did a 27% margin, including integration this quarter,
28% without it. Those numbers were unheard of a few years ago. So, you add it all together, the environment,
very complicated, lots of uncertainty, but frankly for our business model, I think we fare relatively well and
evidence of that is our confidence in the future. And I'm sure we'll talk about that in terms of capital and so on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you, James. Maybe, Sharon, on some more specifics around the buyback. Just thinking about how
you're thinking about buybacks in the second half of the year. I mean, your CET1 did grow quarter-over-quarter,
7


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
but I think [ph] a lot of that (00:22:22) was RWA declining. [indiscernible] (00:22:25) CET1 dollars are still falling,
they've been falling for a while. So, I don't know. Can you maintain the sort of $2.7 billionish buyback a quarter
going forward or any more specifics around how long it will take to exhaust that $20 billion in buybacks you
announced?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, multiyear obviously means more than one year. So, sort of just to put that in perspective. But I think that the
most important thing about the buyback and also the capital more broadly is we've been very prudent and efficient
around our capital usage. I think that we've always said that capital is very much tied to strategy. They're one and
the same. And so, we think about them holistically.
When we think specifically about the buyback and the concept of a multiyear repurchase plan, right, two points.
One, we did complete our old authorization so, therefore, we had to announce a new authorization. And in
addition to that, the point is we provide ourselves with tremendous flexibility in an environment such as this one
where there are, as James said, multiple macroeconomic factors, but also a commitment to continue to return
capital to those shareholders, be that both in the evidence by the increase in the dividend, and I think that what
we're looking for is really – is flexibility around the capital repurchase plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I just want to add something. I mean, it was an important move to $20 billion number. And we said multiyear for a
reason. Obviously, we're not going to do that in one year. But we have enormous flexibility quarter to quarter now.
And that's really important. And with 200 basis points of capital excess, we can use some of that flexibility. Listen,
the stock is trading – I don't know what it is this morning, $72 or something, it was $109 a couple of months ago. I
like buying the stock at $72. And by the way, every time you buy a share at $72, you're retiring a dividend worth
$3.10. So, there's a sort of virtuous circle. We're averaging about 6% of shares outstanding net, we're buying
back plus a 4% dividend, shareholders getting great return with that getting out of bed. So, this is a statement of
confidence of, A, our capital position and, B, the resilience of our business model.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-on on the buyback convo and broaden it out. When you look across all the big G-
SIBs, lots have high – I'm sorry [indiscernible] (00:25:04) lots have higher G-SIB buffers coming, capital deficiency
to their targets and don't have the exit that you have. So, I get it. Buy back cheap stock is great. Are there any
other options that you ponder, like, maybe using that capital to grow share in any parts of the business or just
save for a rainy day? Like, I'm curious on how that dynamic works being one of the only ones with excess
position.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, Glenn, this is sort of the ultimate question. We've built through a decade of, frankly, hard work and discipline
a great excess capital position. Not for nothing. Along the way, we did two major acquisitions. So, we're using it
on deals and two small ones. Solium and Mesa West, you recall. The majors, of course, E*TRADE, Eaton Vance.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
We've taken the dividend – last year we doubled the dividend. And this year we took it up another 11%. It wasn't
so long ago our dividend was $0.05 a quarter. The incremental change this year is $0.075 a quarter.
So, we're investing in the business everywhere, particularly around the workplace, retirement space, we've
invested in the digital bank and building out the wealth space. We've invested in asset management and our
capability and we're going to be doing more of that taking the Eaton Vance funds internationally, expanding the
Parametric program, and then we're investing in banking. I mean, obviously, the banking calendar has been
terrible the last few months, but that's not – we're interested in the next 10 years, not the last few months.
So, the only thing we haven't done with excess capital is do a special dividend, and that's something I'm just
personally not a fan of. I think it's like giving shareholders a problem and saying we don't know what to do with
that money, hey, you take it. So, what we like to do with that money? Invest it in the business, check. Give you a
smart dividend with a 4% yield, check. And do buybacks and have flexibility around it when the stock is trading.
The beginning of the year for every X dollars we've spent, we got four shares retired. Now we're retiring five
shares. I like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Cool. I appreciate all that, James. A follow-up on Wealth Management. Sharon, thank you, you gave color on new
money coming into which types of accounts and new clients. I'm curious what are they doing with it. In other
words, is it sitting in cash? Are cash positions higher than they usually are? What products are they going to? And
then, thirdly, you're the largest gatherer of alternative assets. Has this market brought any noticeable impact to
that opportunity on the Wealth channel? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Let me start with the last. No change in opportunity. I think we continue to actually work very closely with
different alternative managers as we go forward and think about educate FAs, educate FAs to educate their
clients and use that relationship to continue to create the right products for our clients all based on education for
both channels.
In terms of what are they doing with that money, I think what you do see is a lot of the money ends up moving into
fee-based over time, right. So, look at the fact that we aggregated all these net new assets over recent quarters
that first often does come into the system as cash when they're brought over and then that cash is then deployed
into various types of fee-based asset accounts. I think it's worth noting and just repeating that those fee-based
assets are now 50% of our advisor-led channel and those assets, which is a big move from those somewhat 40s,
low 40s that we had seen in previous years.
In terms of very specifically what we've seen over the course of the first half of this year in terms of different types
of product, we were sitting at the end of the fourth quarter with cash levels at around 17% to 18% around the self-
directed and the advice-based channel. We're now at around 21%. Of course, that can be reflective of some of
the equity asset values and the other asset values coming down to increase, but there is somewhat of – there is a
pause. I think people are waiting and observing in certain markets to deploy that cash. And I think that's just – you
can see that in the transactional coming down a bit and DARTs coming down a bit. But I don't want to suggest
that the engagement isn't there because we still are at levels where our engagement as thought about by some of
these dark metrics and just what we've seen in transactional, it's still higher than levels where we were from a pre-
pandemic basis. So, people are engaged, people are active, and they are seeking advice from their FAs.

Hi. Good morning. So, I wanted to ask a follow-up...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Hey Steve, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Wanted to ask a follow-up question on the deposit outlook. As you noted in the prepared remarks, just lots of
crosscurrents this quarter on the deposit side – tax seasonality, cash sorting, and maybe some offset from higher
market volatility. And given the NII guidance, Sharon, that you had laid out, I was hoping you could speak to what
you're assuming for deposit betas and the deposit growth trajectory given the myopic focus on cash sorting and
recognizing that you already laid out some pretty explicit guidance on the loan growth side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think what you just noted at the very end is very important because all of this is weighted into that NII forecast,
right. Deposit betas is just one piece of that conversation, the behavior, and then also how we continue to build in
and aggregate be it new assets through NNA and also various types of, as you call it, cash sorting, but the
movements of cash between products and that behavior of deposits.
Specific to your question around the beta, as we've said, we are informed by the last rate hike cycle. And it does
have to do with the weighted beta at 50%, which I had noted last quarter and will just reiterate again this quarter,
it really has to do with the deposit composition mix that we have. So, we have obviously still accumulated very –
increased levels on those smaller accounts with smaller account levels. And we might have other accounts where
we've seen larger inflows into larger accounts, right. So, account balances that are higher might also have gone
up over time.
And that helps to explain the deposit beta, which we see now based, again, as I said, on that deposit composition
mix. It will not just be, though, of course, around deposit beta. A lot that is embedded into the forecast, as I said,
has to do with how we see those deposit behavior moving over time and, again, a lot of that is informed by what
we saw in the last rate hike cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Very helpful color, Sharon. And maybe just a follow-up on the earlier discussion on organic growth. I mean, the
4% number, which, considering the more pronounced tax seasonality, elevated market volatility, was certainly an
impressive result. If the market volatility persists, should we view this as a reasonable floor on organic growth?
10


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
And I was also hoping you could just speak to the cadence of flows from April to June just to give us a sense as to
how organic growth is trajecting over the course of the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, the cadence is obviously – you've seen more in the second two – I mean, you've seen a different mix, right,
in the second two months than the first month because you had a tax outflow season. So, that kind of gives you
the change in the two numbers. I think what we have seen is a – you have a lot that comes in from a flow-based
basis is just – if you think about workplace, you're going to see that development and continue as people have
exercised their options, they continue to move forward. So, there are various types of offsets.
I think what's important as we look forward in terms of where is the floor, look, we've said historically, we don't
expect to be in that very low single digit range, which we were before the acquisition of E*TRADE. We said that
11% was too high. So, that kind of gave you that middle range. Exactly how it will pan out? What I can say to you
is it's still healthy and we still feel well-positioned.
As it relates specifically to other indicators that you might think about, for example, recruiting, the recruiting
pipeline remains healthy. And what we often see and tactically, anecdotally, is when those recruits come over,
they could be, in a market volatility event, actually be quicker to begin to bring those assets that were held away
into the channel. Why? Because they're seeking to be with their FA through that advice-led channel more
immediately. So, as you called it, there are crosscurrents, and I think they're important to bear in mind in this
environment.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on Investment Management and the fee outlook you have.
Obviously, beta working against you on some of your higher fee products, but you have fee waivers coming off on
the money market side. So, as you think about mix and client behavior going forward, how do you think about the
fee rates in that business longer term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
It's a great question. I'm sure you'll see the disclosure also that will come out in the Q specifically for this
business. But just to give you a sense, the fee rates themselves haven't changed. What has changed is the mix of
the actual flows themselves. So, we've seen a decrease over the course of the last few quarters in some of those
equity accounts, for example, which, as is disclosed, can have higher fees. But what we have seen is an increase
in balances and things like liquidity where we're now not seeing those fee waivers since we've moved off that zero
bound floor. We had given you previous guidance of $200 million that we expected to see as an incremental fee
positive over the course of the year as those waivers went away because rates came off of that zero bound. We
stand behind that guidance and you continue to see that flow into the numbers.
I think, though, what is important is, obviously, where could you see things change is the liquidity balances, right.
It's a [ph] rate times balance (00:35:50) question, as I've said before. And the balances, in this case, I think is a
testament to the amount of time and the investment we've put into this business to find relationships also across

forge relationships that will help bring in some of those deposits into those money market products.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, given the backdrop we're in where revenues are a bit more
challenged or uncertain. As you think about non-comp expense, and you highlighted being focused on this area
and being efficient, but have you proactively started to make decisions around spend and cutting back, or as you
think about that flexibility in the back half of the year, is there a way to quantify levels of growth or lack thereof and
any changes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So, the first point that I would highlight to you is that, ex-integration, our efficiency ratio is at 7% and that includes
the legal charge that James mentioned this quarter. So I think we have shown and continue to demonstrate
discipline around our expense base very similar to the way we think about capital resources. We think about it
very holistically and part of our strategic decision-making process.
As we walked into the second quarter, we were aware that the environment was changing and we all had been
seeing the same events that we've all witnessed together as it relates to geopolitical front and the macro side.
And we came in and we took a look – a hard look – and we continue to do so, individual product by product,
investment by investment, project by project to understand where are the potential growth and expenses coming
from, how are we thinking about balancing, as James said, that near-term investment, making sure that we need
to get done certain things. We always need to ensure that as we invest also with a longer-term horizon, the right
controls are in place as we continue to grow the business efficiently. But are there projects that can be delayed
that we might be doing on the margins? So I'd say that that work is in flight, has been in flight. It's not new
information, and it's certainly something that we're keeping our eyes on.

Just wanted to follow up on the Institutional Securities business. So, you talked about a market share opportunity
that you clearly have. Would love to hear your thoughts around just the health of, one, how's the plumbing in the
capital market functioning? We saw a bunch of headlines around hung deals, et cetera, during the quarter. So,
just how are clients holding up on the Institutional side? And given how strong the franchise already is on the
prime brokerage side, is there more opportunity there? I realize that was a big driver of the growth this quarter. So
would love to hear your thoughts.

Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
From basically in terms of the capital market functioning, as James said, we're not in a position of the same kind
of stress we've seen in other necessary cycles. We're still seeing functioning markets. You can see that in just
some of the funded balance points that I made across the ISG portfolio in terms of funded balances being at 11%
versus even in the pandemic we had seen those balances up to 25%. So I would certainly say that you see
institutions that are in a good place.
I also think, from a corporate perspective, it is worth noting that many came into this from an environmental
perspective in a much better position than they have before because they did issue and were in a good spot from
a balance sheet perspective in a period of low rates that you saw over the course of last year. Of course, there
are days where it's more difficult to come to market. That is very clear as you see that in the underwriting results
so just to provide that balance. Of course, it's not the same thing as having a green screen every single day. But I
think that you are seeing both institutions and corporations, et cetera, taking advantage of days where the market
is open, and they are able to do that and from that perspective the market is functioning.
As it relates to prime brokerage, we've been very balanced in that business. I think we've been a tremendous
leader in that business. And we continue to effectively look for the relationship that we're well-suited for both in
this environment that makes sense to partner with clients. You see that on the balance side. You see that on the
revenue side. And you see that the mix also matters to us. And so, from that perspective, we've been very
focused on the equities business more holistically for over a decade now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for that. And just on the fixed income, so appreciate that you all right-sized the business a few years ago.
Like, given the capital constraints at your peers, does it make sense, maybe James or Sharon, to like lean in and
revisit areas where you could actually pick up share on the fixed income side? Or no?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Listen, there's always opportunities to and environments where you can try and pick up share. We're in a bit of an
uncertain world, as I opened with. I don't think this is the time to be overly aggressive personally. I like the fact we
have excess capital. I like where our CET1 ratio is. Obviously, as you drive up RWAs, you eat into that. We
actually brought up RWAs down by $40 billion this quarter. I think the Institutional team in both fixed income and
equities were very prudent and appropriately so. So, listen, if the option is to trigger another 50 basis points on the
SCB or generate, I don't know, $100 million, $200 million in revenue, that for me is a very easy call right now. I
like the 50 basis points that we haven't had to trigger that some of our competitors have.
So, listen, we'll be eyes wide open. But we're not trying to win the game right now. The fixed income business has
gone from doing, I don't know, what they were doing, $500 million, $600 million a quarter in the back half of 2015,
and we're consistently at somewhere between $1.75 billion and $3 billion. They've done a phenomenal job.
They've materially gained share. I think we're around 10% share, up from 6% or lower in those days. Stable
business. Great leadership. So, yeah, we'll be opportunistic, but we're not going to be greedy.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on Steve's questions on deposit beta, but
rather talk about the balance side of things. So, the brokerage sweep deposits declined by about $30 billion this
quarter. Sharon, I think you referenced that was driven by both tax payments, but also some yield seeking. Could
you maybe break that down a little bit or do you have a sense about what that attribution would be just so we can
kind of level set and think about how much further potential deposit – deposit loss there could be from further yield
seeking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think the better – I mean, I think that one quarter would be a little bit difficult to kind of draw those
conclusions. I think the way I would think about it, Brennan, is a little bit differently, which is some of the questions
I know we've received are, well, why didn't your beta come down because you had E*TRADE and so those
balances should be in a position where you should have an average weighted beta that's lower over time.
So I think the best way to kind of answer your question a little bit more head on in terms of where the underlying
crux is, is we have seen balances also increase in the higher account level. That's built into the model. It's built
into our expectations. It's built into the NII forecast. And we've said, as I said directly in my remarks, we also saw
deposit behavior very much in line with what we expected. And so, it is working in terms of that predictability. But
why is the beta then higher? Some of that beta just has to do with you have some higher balances. Why?
Because you accumulated them likely at periods of time where yields were lower and there was excess cash that
was sitting in position. And so, some of that higher balance amount begins to leave seeking out higher yielding
payments. So I think that can help give you a little bit of construct in terms of what's going on from the balance
perspective to more directly I think answer the question rather than just look at one quarter's behavior.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. Sure. Okay. That's fair. Thank you. And then when we think about the SBL book, you flagged the $22 billion
of continued loan growth. So, it seems like you're expecting loan growth in the back half to be about half of what
you saw in the first half, a little more than that, but not by much. And it makes sense it would slow. Can you talk
about what we've seen from an LTV perspective in the SBL book? And whether or not some of that slowing loan
growth is going to reflect some – maybe some SBL pay-down or is there the potential of some SBL reduction just
because LTVs are getting high and so there's going to need to be some of that just mechanically and maybe also
how you manage those LTVs in these choppy market environments? Multi-parter, sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. So, the LTVs are very well-managed. No, it's okay. It's okay. I'll just try to remember it all. So, from the LTV
perspective, as you would expect, we're very much actually in line with where we've been from historical years.
And the reason for that is it is a very well-managed book. And why any uptick at all, as you would expect,
obviously, the value of the underlying has gone down. But from a historical basis, we've always been within that –
we've sort of given a 40% range – a low 40% range. We're in that range and we're very much, like I said, in line
over the last couple of years.
Now, as it relates directly to what we're looking forward and seeing, I think what's important here is that from a
mortgage perspective, you might see some slowing just, obviously, given where rates are. Now, why would the
14

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
SBLs come down? You just might not have as much interest or engagement in the products with lower asset
values. So, I don't look at it in terms of, oh, there's a management issue. Rather, that is a very well-managed
portfolio where we haven't seen issues in a lot of different market environments with the calls from an operational
perspective more broadly, et cetera. But rather, just the engagement from that relationship side, is this the right
product to be using now. You might not have those conversations as much with the asset values coming down.
So, very practical answer to the question that you give.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just a follow-up on the loan growth. The $20 billion loan growth chart at the start of the year, it looks like you're
still looking at that. But how are you thinking about loss rates on those new loans given perhaps a new economic
forecast? We note that provisions for wealth losses are already triple the level of last year. Kind of what's the risk
in that portfolio? And does it make sense to have a loan growth target? It's always easy to make loans. It's just
tough to get paid back sometimes. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think that the loan growth target is – I mean, just in terms of – it's more of an expectation to help people
understand where the NII trajectory is. I wouldn't call it a target. To the point that was raised by Brennan,
obviously, the expectations on a quarter-over-quarter basis have come down. So, we did see some pull forward,
and that's all what we're reflecting in that.
As you look at the provisions themselves, they're still very on a relative basis to other provisions across various –
those institutions and even our Institutional Securities franchise is quite low. In terms of what drives that, as you
know, it is based on the CECL concept and the life of loan concept and you also know it is a complicated idea
between both qualitative and a quantitative scenario. For us, as we disclosed in our Q, the factors that we look at
that are most important is really around GDP. We did see a degradation in the GDP expectation. So, very
consistent with what's gone on in the macroeconomic outlook. And we are expecting the recession that we've
talked about, the probabilities are in the 50/50 range, and that's very consistent with also what we've said publicly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2022
Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, in the workplace channel, you guys had some good growth in the number of
participants, on a year-over-year basis, it was up 17%. The unvested asset values declined about 33%. Can you
give us a little color? Was it primarily just market conditions bringing that down or is there something else there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
It's a great question, and you draw a good point distinction. No, those are just the value – it's just the value of the
assets themselves have gone down that those holders have. Now, the increase in participants has a lot to do with
the fact that we just continue – as we continue to win mandates, we've seen that increase the number of
participants. What I would say in terms of just an opportunity in terms of engaging with those clients is, obviously,
it is a difficult time and environment for some of those individuals, and we continue to educate and use financial
loan as a tool especially in these environments to explain the advice-driven model and provide us with an
opportunity actually in this kind of environment to discuss what financial advice and what financial wellness is
specifically as people see different declines in their potential portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And do the assets skew to more new start-up companies that might be tech-orientated versus a more
traditional industrial company or a staple company in those plans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
There is a good portion, I would say, of technology companies that would be in that sector that you can see, as
you see those asset values decline. But there is a balance on the other side of different types of companies. And
as we win mandates, it's not just on the tech side. We're winning mandates across different institutions, especially
as people better understand that financial wellness offering.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Appreciate all the details on slide 11 here, the allowance for credit losses. Maybe you've had it
before but it's more relevant now and good detail. If you had to kind of guesstimate in a moderate recession, that
$1.2 billion of total ACL, where does that go?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think that is a very difficult question to answer. I think that what you can look at and think about it is, obviously,
the economic scenario makes sense, the GDP makes sense, the size of where the growth actually comes from
and goes, and then there is some extension of duration that you can see dependent on the rate rise expectation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Any way to frame? Is it double or triple? Obviously, a lot of the loans are in Wealth Management, which is
just not going to, you would think, have as much loss content, but any way to frame, numerically, how high it could
go?

Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I mean, you know what I would do, I would say is why don't you think about it as it relates to COVID, right. You
can think about where we were from a COVID perspective. And so let's talk ISG specifically. The provisions this
quarter are $82 million. It was almost four times that when you think about where we were from a COVID
perspective.

Matt O'Connor Q

Okay. That's helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I would just point out that – sorry. I'd just point out that the Wealth Management piece, ACL percentage is 0.1.
These are very different kinds of loans from traditional consumer banking loans. So, you're just not going to see,
at least for that part of it, a major, major move. For the others, I think it's just – you can't project. I mean, who
knows what kind of recession the recession might be, how long it might be, and so on. But we manage this
business conservatively and we don't have a big traditional middle market small business loan book. We just don't
have that kind of business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And then just a clarification question. The total DCP for the firm, you mentioned $515 million
revenue impact in Wealth. But what's the firm-wide revenue and expense impact, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
It's not material per business line, which is why we don't call out the number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
The reason we called it out in Wealth, just to be clear, was Wealth actually had a great quarter, all right, revenue
growth, new money growth, fee-based growth, and margins year-over-year, the same, at 27% in a very difficult
environment. So, we thought it was kind of raining on the party a little bit that the DCP took $500 million off the top
line number even though it comes out of the comp expense number almost dollar-for-dollar, not quite. So, that's
why we called it out.
Ordinarily, we wouldn't call out DCP. We don't make a big deal of it. It's an accounting issue. It's not a business
issue. So, we're not often that excited about it. But we just thought given you'd all be interested in how the retail
investor was behaving right now and what was going on in that business and how panicked they were, the short
answer is not very, behaving well, business stable, saw growth. Hence, we wanted to call it out.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just on the RWA decline. Was that a deliberate reduction or is that more market-
driven? And if [ph] somewhat – some (00:55:22) deliberate actions, can you kind of give us a little more clarity on
what those actions were specifically and if that can continue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. It was both is the way I would answer it. There are obviously market declines that had to do with it as well.
But this was a very thoughtful approach around efficient uses of RWAs and where does it make sense from
business perspective given the uncertainty. And I think there is a very, as I said, the same way when we think
about the expenses, it's about being efficient and thoughtful and very prudent and flexible with all of that
environment. So, it's both of those things that were taken into account when thinking about the RWA decline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Listen, I want to make an important point here. We regard our capital ratios as sacrosanct. These are a big deal
for us. We've spent a decade building them. We like having excess capital for exactly this environment we're in
now. We can buy back up to $20 billion. And a bunch of it we're going to be doing hopefully in the low 70s. So,
making sure we give ourselves that flexibility, demonstrating discipline in a tough environment. I think Ted and the
ISG team did a phenomenal job in driving that number down. And obviously, it's driven in part by volatility in the
market, so things outside of their control. But this is something that we should and will try and control as best as
we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. Maybe as a follow-up on that, James. I think you've talked about hoping the change in the mix of your
business over time would push your DFAST losses and SCB down slightly this year is probably a [ph] peer
(00:57:04) victory relative to what [ph] – some (00:57:06) happened to your peers. But do you think there's still
room to see that come down over time given your changing mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Absolutely. Look the PPNR number was materially up as [ph] stress losses (00:57:20) were also up. Not
surprisingly, the test was incredibly demanding in this environment. But notwithstanding that, we increased the
dividend and we still came out at [ph] 13.3% I think versus 13.2% (00:57:30). We're very focused on the SCB
buffer not getting away from us. The change in business model, the growth in the asset management business,
the growth in the workplace retirement business, all of these things which frankly are very capital friendly, yeah,
that number is going to keep moving.
Then we have an argument, we've been – or not argument, I won't put it that way, but let's just say a different
point of view with the Federal Reserve about how they treat financial advisor compensation during a time of
stress. And we have argued for a long time that financial advisor compensation is obviously variable, so that
18

expense comes down when revenues come down. The Fed has not yet seen it our way, but we're continuing to
push that argument strongly. And when it does, we believe that will free up another bunch of capital.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, James, you've talked about variable expenses for variable revenues, and the revenues were down and
comp was down. But at what point do you pull the lever on kind of Plan B? I mean, you said 50/50 on a recession,
and Sharon talked about maybe delaying some projects. But when it comes to resource allocation, head count,
more aggressive moves to prepare for a difficult environment, you said yourself that it's uncertain, it's not the time
to take too much extra risk, push for market share. But is it time to go to Plan B, a more recession-like scenario in
terms of your resource management?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
No. It's not. We're overwhelmingly in the US. We had 6% revenue growth in the Wealth Management business,
produced ex-integration 28% margins. This is a business we definitely don't want to harm in this environment, and
we are managing. I mean, I guess, it's quasi-Plan B, managing the RWAs, as we just said, and the balance sheet
reflecting a more stressed environment. We met as a management committee last September, I think, and I
spoke to the management committee about I felt there was much more downside risk to the market. The
magnitude of it I didn't have a strong feeling for, but I thought it was somewhere between significant and a really
significant, and I think we're in the sort of significant phase of it right now.
So, we started pulling back, Mike, at that point. We've got a very clear handle on head count growth on where that
growth is. We've also got lot of regulatory obligations we've got to continue to fulfill, as all the banks do. But right
now, we're definitely not in a sort of crisis mode at all. I mean, if we were, we wouldn't be buying back $20 billion,
increasing the dividend 11%. On the other hand, balance sheet growth will be very measured. I think we'll pick up
share by banks coming back to us, not necessarily us having to move forward. And as I think Sharon articulated
very well, we're doing a pretty systematic review of the prioritization of all the projects going on around the firm.
Listen, in a big company like this with $60 billion of revenue, we have a lot of stuff going on, and we have choices
as to when we do it.
So I'd call it a sort of Plan A minus, not a Plan B, if you will. But that's the mindset we're in. However, if things get
worse, and in my career I've seen a lot of recessions, a lot of crises, a lot of damage done to the environment, if
things really deteriorated, particularly in the US, then we'd take a much more aggressive position, and we
obviously have the ultimate weapon which is comp.
