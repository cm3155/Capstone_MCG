Kessel D. Stelling
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2020
earnings call.
This past year was one that none of us will ever forget and certainly challenging for the industry and for our
company. From the pandemic to social and political unrest, the year presented more intensive challenges in a
more concentrated period than any single time in my 40-plus year banking career, including the financial crisis
just over a decade ago. So I want to start by thanking team members, their dedication and their tireless efforts to
get us through another year of uncertainty. And by thanking customers and communities for trusting us to play an
active role in helping them recover and rebuild.
Slide 3 includes some notable achievements from 2020. So starting with the Paycheck Protection Program
through which we extended approximately 19,000 loans totaling $2.9 billion to customers across the Southeast.
P3 represented a truly Herculean effort by our team to quickly deliver critical aid to customers and communities in
need.

We're also off to a very strong start with the newest round of P3, with approximately 5,000 loan applications
submitted totaling $700 million in the request. We operate in one of the best geographic footprints in banking, and
last year, we continued to improve our competitive positioning for 2021 and beyond.
This past January, we announced our transformational Synovus Forward initiative and we made significant
progress throughout the year executing on our Phase 1 revenue and efficiency efforts. As previously stated, we
expect to achieve $100 million in pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of this year. And Kevin will provide more
detail later on plans for an additional $75 million in benefits by the end of 2022.
We made additional investments in talent and solutions to support growth and to enhance technology that further
improves the customer experience. Last year, we made upgrades to our mobile and online banking portal, online
account origination capabilities and other digital touch points, and we continued to invest in and grow our existing
businesses while also building out new offerings. During the year, we onboarded new affordable housing and
agro business expertise, significantly expanded our merchant services business, and further matured our
structured lending in treasury and payment solutions capabilities.
Also during the year, given the dramatic change in the underlying economic environment, we moved quickly to
further strengthen our balance sheet and capital position. Our CET1 ratio increased over 70 basis points ending
the year at 9.7%. In addition, our ACL ratio increased to 75 basis points from day one CECL implementation and
our total risk-based capital ended the year at 13.4%, the highest level since 2014. As a result, we entered this
year very well-positioned to facilitate additional growth while also effectively managing balance sheet risk.
I'm also proud of our work last year in important areas that are not directly disclosed in financial statements but
are important sources of value, such as ESG reporting, financial literacy outreach, and financial support of
nonprofits and community agencies, including the establishment of a substantial scholarship endowment for
African American students through the UNCF in honor of our former colleague and longtime Georgia state
representative, Calvin Smyre.
Finally, we announced last month that I'll be transitioning from Chairman and CEO to Executive Chairman of our
board in April following our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. I'll serve in that role until January 1st of 2023. To be
clear, this is not my final earnings call, so no farewells or goodbyes just yet. I'll participate in our first quarter call in
April, and then will hand the reins over to Kevin and team to take it from there.
With that, I'll turn to Jamie to share fourth quarter financial highlights beginning on slide 4.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kessel. We ended the year strong with diluted EPS of $0.96 per share compared to $0.56 last quarter
and $0.97 a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $1.08 per share compared to $0.89 last quarter and $0.94 a
year ago. Total adjusted revenues of $499 million were up $5 million from last quarter led by broad-based
increases in fee revenue, continued reductions in deposit costs and accelerated P3 loan forgiveness income.
Adjusted noninterest expense of $275 million was up $6 million from last quarter, which was impacted by a $5
million increase in Synovus Forward, P3 and COVID-related expenses.
Moving to slide 5. Total loans declined $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, including accelerated P3 loan forgiveness
that resulted in balance declines of $516 million. Total lending partnership loans held for investment declined $81
million, while loans held for sale from this category increased $81 million. Excluding reductions in P3 and lending
partnership balances, total loans declined $700 million or 2% from the third quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Total C&I loans declined $640 million in the fourth quarter, including the $516 million coming from accelerated P3
forgiveness. Line utilization continued to decline in the quarter, down an additional $57 million. C&I line utilization
of 40% was 6% lower than it was the same quarter last year and remained near historic lows.
Total CRE loans declined $395 million as pay-off and paydown activity increased significantly in the fourth quarter
as transactions that were delayed during the height of the pandemic were completed. Total consumer loans
declined $282 million. This included lending partnership reductions as well as paydowns within our mortgage and
HELOC portfolios.
As shown on slide 6, we had total deposit growth of $2 billion. Fourth quarter increases were led by core
transaction deposit growth of $1.8 billion and $1 billion in seasonal public funds. Offsetting this growth were
expected declines in time and broker deposits. The cost of deposits fell by 11 basis points from the previous
quarter to 28 basis points due to a combination of rates paid and deposit remixing.
In the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce the cost of time deposits by 28 basis points and the cost of money
market deposits by 9 basis points. In this lower-for-longer rate environment, we believe there are additional
opportunities to reduce deposit costs through CD turnover, ongoing repricing, as well as the ability to continue to
remix the deposit composition.
Slide 7 shows net interest income of $386 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $9 million from the third
quarter that was primarily due to the impact of increased P3 forgiveness. Net interest income was further
supported by deposit cost efforts, previously mentioned, and was offset by modest headwinds from lower loan
balances and continued pressure from fixed-rate asset repricing. Exclusive of P3 fee accretion, NII in the fourth
quarter was $361 million as compared to $365 million the prior quarter.
We are pleased with continued progress on deposit repricing and positive remixing trends on the liability side of
the balance sheet. The current environment is enabling us to grow our core relationships and further improve our
overall liability profile, which is serving to offset a portion of the headwind we are experiencing from repricing
within our fixed-rate asset portfolios. The net interest margin was 3.12%, up 2 basis points from the previous
quarter. The additional P3 fee accretion of $13 million to a total of $25 million was a meaningful contributor to that
increase.
Conversely, considerable deposit inflows coupled with the timing of our subordinated debt transaction, led to an
elevated level of one balance sheet liquidity within the fourth quarter with average excess cash balances
increasing $1.4 billion. This dynamic can have a notable impact on the margin with every $1 billion of extra cash
on balance sheet diluting the margin by approximately 6 basis points.
In the coming quarters, we expect the elevated cash position to decline as we experience seasonal deposit
outflows and as we manage our balance sheet and overall liquidity position. This will include further growth within
our securities portfolio as well as declines in noncore funding sources such as brokered deposits. As of year-end,
there were $49 million of Phase 1 P3 processing fees remaining with approximately $20 million associated with
loans that had initiated the forgiveness process.
Excluding the impact from P3, we expect modest downward pressure in NII and NIM in the first quarter from the
rate environment, as asset growth and further reductions in cost of funds partially offset continued fixed rate asset
re-pricing.

Slide 8 shows non-interest revenue, which was $115 million, flat to the prior quarter. After adjusting for security
gains, adjusted non-interest revenue was $112 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter
included notable increases in service charges, fiduciary and asset management, card fees and brokerage income.
Core banking revenue improved by $3 million to $37 million, primarily due to increased activity as we continue the
gradual return to pre-COVID levels. Service charges on deposits, SBA gains, and card fees each increased about
$1 million from the previous quarter. $2 million in revenue growth from fiduciary and asset management,
brokerage, and insurance helped offset the $1 million decline in capital markets revenue, resulting from lower loan
activity.
Net mortgage revenue of $24 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter remained elevated. Secondary
mortgage production increased 4% which directly impacted commissions. Despite a quarter-over-quarter increase
in secondary production, fee income declined due to lower margin and pipeline.
Total non-interest expenses were $302 million, down $14 million. On an adjusted basis, NIE was $275 million, up
$6 million from the prior quarter. Adjustments include $14 million related to the voluntary early retirement program
we announced in October, $8 million in loss on early extinguishment of debt, and $4 million in branch optimization
real estate write-downs. Payback on all of these strategic initiatives are 2.5 years or less.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted NIE includes $5 million related to Synovus Forward, P3, and
COVID. The Synovus Forward expenses are upfront third-party expenses associated with the design and build of
these strategic initiatives. This quarter's expenses are largely tied to the pricing for value and commercial
analytics programs. Most of the $3 million increase in P3 and COVID-related expenses are upfront consulting and
technology fees to streamline the forgiveness process. We are encouraged by the forward impact of efforts we've
taken and investments we've made throughout the year, including the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we realized an additional $2.5 million in savings from Synovus Forward that offset investments
in digital and technology. These include the first phase rollout of our new commercial digital platform Synovus
Gateway, continuing migration of systems to a cloud environment and enhancements to our BSA/AML
technology. These investments will provide future revenue, scale, risk, and expenses benefits in 2021 and
beyond.
In the fourth quarter, head count declined by 100, most of which occurred in December as part of the voluntary
early retirement plan. Savings from this initiative largely began January 1. So, these salary reductions will help
offset the seasonal first quarter increases in employment taxes. Kevin will speak to our full year guidance shortly.
Before providing some comments related to key credit metrics on slide 10, I'd like to provide a brief update on our
COVID-related deferral program which provided for up to 180 days of deferred payments of principal and interest.
Loans in this program with a full P&I deferral declined 34 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter.
Performance for borrowers that completed a deferral period has been strong with approximately 99% paying as
agreed.
As we've shared in the past, we've conducted enhanced monitoring on industries that were likely to experience
the most pressure from the pandemic. Elevated risks remain, and are largely concentrated in hospitality-related
segments, including hotels and full service restaurants. More information on those portfolios is available in the
appendix.

As evidenced by key credit metrics, we're not seeing widespread credit deterioration. Credit measures of NPLs,
NPAs, criticized, and classified assets all remained relatively stable for the quarter. Past dues and net charge-offs
declined modestly. Based on our forward-looking credit metrics, customer cash flow analysis, and customer
interactions, we expect net charge-offs in the first quarter to be at or near the range we experienced in the back
half of 2020.
Cash inflow updates, which are also in the appendix, generally showed continued improvement through
November, although we do expect some pressure to these inflows from recent surges in COVID cases. This
pressure will likely be more impactful in the same hospitality segments I mentioned, and were the main driver of
increased in criticized and classified loans in the third quarter.
Provision for credit losses of $11 million include net charge-offs of $22 million or 23 basis points. Provision for
credit losses other than net charge-offs reflect lower loan balances and a more favorable economic outlook. The
allowance for credit losses ended the fourth quarter at $654 million and the ACL ratio increased 1 basis point to
1.81% excluding P3 loans. The year-end allowance includes a multi-scenario framework with a base economic
outlook which incorporates the most recent stimulus with modest economic growth and declines in unemployment
rate throughout 2021 and 2022.
We return to a two-year reasonable and supportable period this quarter as economic uncertainty is moderated.
Another noteworthy change included use of a third-party provider's economic projections as a starting point for
our economic outlook rather than a benchmark or challenger as it was used earlier in the year. Changing to a
third-party provider did not have a material impact on the economic inputs or resulting allowance. There's more
detail included in the appendix.
Preliminary capital ratios on slide 11 show continued improvement as CET1 increased 37 basis points to 9.7%
this quarter. We ended the year above the higher end of our operating range of 9% to 9.5%, which positions us
well as we move into the New Year. The total risk-based capital ratio of 13.4% was up 25 basis points. It includes
subordinated debt optimization efforts completed in the fourth quarter that aligns with our ongoing efforts to
diligently manage our capital position and weighted average cost of capital.
Our 2021 capital plan maintains the current common shareholder dividend of $0.33 per quarter and includes
authorization for share purchases of up to $200 million. We will be opportunistic with repurchase activity
throughout the year as we prioritize organic growth first and balance capital deployment, with factors such as
uncertainty in the economic outlook.
Based on the current outlook, we will continue to target a CET1 ratio at the higher end of the 9% to 9.5% range
with more opportunity to deploy capital as we gain greater clarity around the effectiveness of the vaccine, as well
as confidence in the broader economic recovery.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide an update on Synovus Forward and provide our 2021 outlook.

Thanks, Jamie. Let me take a few minutes to provide a brief update on our Synovus Forward progress. Having
initiated the program back in the second half of 2019, 2020 was a year of execution and expansion. As we have
shared, the initial focus was on funding our journey through various efficiency initiatives. I am pleased with our
progress and the delivery surrounding these first round programs. The third-party spend program will fully deliver

$25 million run rate savings in 2021. We also consolidated 13 branch locations this past year which will result in
approximately $5 million in run rate savings on a go-forward basis.
And as we close out 2020, we completed two components of organizational efficiency work stream with a
voluntary early retirement program and a back office staffing optimization, which will produce $13 million in run
rate benefit in 2021.
As 2020 progressed, we expanded our efforts within Synovus Forward by embarking on several revenue-based
initiatives, starting with our pricing for value program, we have begun the market-based re-pricing of our treasury
and payment solutions offerings and are pleased with the progress to-date, with an anticipated run rate benefit of
approximately $9 million in the first half of 2021.
As Jamie has also noted, we have been able to more aggressively re-price our deposit throughout 2020 with the
month of December coming in below our previous cycle lows. We also kicked off our commercial analytics
program, utilizing transaction level data we have built a tool known as [ph] Smart (00:20:52) that will allow our
commercial bankers to better identify opportunities to expand relationships, reduce attrition as well as better
manage changes in underlying risk profiles.
As we begin to pilot the [ph] Smart (00:21:06) tool, we are convinced we will see incremental revenue benefits
from its full deployment. We have also prioritized resources, capital expenditures and business activities to ensure
that we have continued to invest prudently during the year. As Kessel referenced, during the 2020 highlights, we
made significant improvements in our consumer and business digital capabilities during the year. Enhancements
made improved the customer experience, expanded new account origination availability and built a more scalable
platform for future functionality deployment.
As a result of our progress and the plans for additional Phase 1 initiatives, we remain committed to deliver the
$100 million run rate pre-tax benefits by the end of 2021. We have also increased our objective by an additional
$75 million run rate benefit to be achieved by the yearend 2022.
The additional benefits will come from both revenue and expense initiatives with a heavier weight towards
revenues. Much of the additional benefit will come from expanding the breadth and depth of the programs already
launched, as well as leveraging new processes, technology, products and solutions, and talent to generate the
incremental benefits. We will provide more detail throughout the year as we set more specific execution plans for
the next phase of Synovus Forward.
Turning to slide 13, this slide provides an overview of our 2021 outlook which incorporates Synovus Forward
initiatives and other strategic objectives and is predicated on our current view of the economic stability and growth
in our footprint for the year. Before I share more details around the individual categories, let me first touch on a
few things that gives me confidence as we enter 2021. First, the talent we have added in recent years continues
to provide outsized opportunities for growth as they continue to build their portfolios to more seasoned levels.
Secondly, investments we are making in products and capabilities continue to pay dividends. For example,
treasury and payment solutions new revenue in 2020 was up 160% over 2019 and 450% over two years ago. And
lastly, our teams are better prepared for the operating environment in 2021 and will be able to avoid many of the
distractions and challenges that we encountered in 2020. With our enhanced online account origination
capabilities and remote sales approaches, our sales effectiveness for the year will improve.

So, let's start with the asset side of the balance sheet. We expect an additional 65% to 70% of the P3 loans
funded in 2020 to be forgiven by mid-2021, leaving around $500 million on the books for an extended period. As
Kessel mentioned earlier, we are participating in the second round of the P3 program, and since opening our
portal on January 19th, we have received strong application volumes and are working diligently to efficiently
process the request to support our eligible customers' and prospects' needs.
Based upon our results to date as well as our preliminary analysis of eligibility, we believe the number of
applicants will range from 5,000 to 7,500, which compares to just over 19,000 last year. We expect the average
loan size to be less than the round one average of approximately $150,000, which would result in a higher
percentage of fee revenue.
Excluding all P3 balance changes, we expect loan growth of approximately 2% to 4% in 2021. Given the current
environment, we do forecast this growth to accelerate in the back half of the year and will be well-diversified
across business units, asset classes, and geography. Despite continued uncertainty in the markets, we have
reasons to be optimistic about our expectations for loan growth. Our expectations are that we will see a steady
increase in production throughout 2021 in our commercial book as economic activity improves. From our
discussions with our customers, we also know there is a pent-up demand for capital that has been delayed due to
the overarching uncertainties.
Synovus is well-positioned for growth given our marketplace and business model. Entering 2020, our teams were
achieving record levels of production and we expect to return to similar levels post pandemic. We love our
footprint and the outsized growth expectations for the Southeast. The demographics of our markets continue to be
very constructive for growth. In addition, our model is very attractive to both prospective customers and banking
talent, and we've seen this over the recent years. As such, we expect to continue to see organic growth arising
from the execution of our go-to-market strategy as well as any fallout that may occur as industry consolidation
continues.
We've also added and expanded through our new specialty verticals in 2020, including structured lending,
affordable housing, and agri business. These teams will provide accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond as we
continue to evaluate the expansion into new industry and asset class specialty areas that will expand our offerings
and provide new sources of growth in the future.
A return to a more normalized C&I line utilization would increase funded loan balances by $650 million as
compared to year-end balances. Although there is obviously some uncertainty related to how quickly this will take
place, especially with the possibility of additional stimulus and elevated liquidity, we do expect the normalization to
occur over time. Lastly, we have the capacity to increase our lending partnership portfolios, which can serve as an
effective and profitable use of excess liquidity and capital. As Jamie mentioned earlier, given the current liquidity
environment and the recent increase in interest rates, we are likely to increase the size of the securities portfolio
in the near-term.
Now, let's move to revenue. Net interest income will remain under pressure from fixed rate asset repricing. We will
actively work to reduce the impact of rates through balance sheet management, loan growth, future reductions in
cost of deposits, as well as the potential deployment of excess liquidity in the investment portfolio or higher
returning asset classes such as third-party lending.
There is a similar story with fee revenue, which faces the headwind of normalized secondary mortgage revenue.
The expected decline in mortgage activity will be largely offset by increases in most other categories, including
core banking fees as well as fiduciary and asset management fees. Our investment in treasury and payment
9

solutions, the recently launched merchant program, and various wealth management businesses will provide
added momentum throughout 2021.
One business that we are especially excited about is the Synovus Family Office. Despite a challenging year, the
Family Office grew assets under management by 23% and new business revenue booked for the year increased
66%. This unique value and service provided by businesses like Synovus Family Office will provide continuous
growth opportunities. In aggregate, we expect total adjusted revenues to decline 1% to 4% in 2021. Some
opportunities to perform at the higher end of the range include more favorable deposit pricing, further steepening
in the yield curve, higher than expected economic activity, increased participation in Phase 2 of the P3 program,
and acceleration of the benefits from enhanced analytics and other revenue-centric Synovus Forward initiatives.
Moving to expenses, in the fourth quarter, we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with branch
and head count reductions. As we assess the current environment and the resulting pressures on revenue, we
are proactively adjusting our expense base to promote a return to positive operating leverage. Despite our overall
actions to reduce expenses, it is not inhibiting our ability to continue to invest in areas of focus with approximately
$20 million in strategic investments in technology and digital plan for 2021. In aggregate, we expect adjusted
expenses to decline between 2% and 5% for the year. We continue to assess, challenge, and target all expense
categories as we look to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness and remain committed to positive
operating leverage over the long-term. A large portion of the annual decrease will be realized in the second half of
2021 as seasonal increases in employment tax and the previously mentioned investments in digital and
technology will be more frontloaded.
Turning to capital, our CET1 ratio of 9.7% is above our stated operating range of 9% to 9.5%. Existing capital
levels as well as the inflow from 2021 core earnings will support our anticipated balance sheet growth and
strategic objectives. Jamie mentioned some components of the 2021 capital plan, so I'll simply reiterate that we're
a growth company and that's our first priority for deploying capital. Other priorities include maintaining a
competitive dividend, capital optimization, and other deployment opportunities, including share repurchases. The
CET1 target of 9.5% in the 2021 outlook is at the higher end of our 9% to 9.5% operating range, which we believe
is prudent while greater levels of uncertainty exists. Given our current CET1 ratio and our economic outlook, it is
likely we will remain above our targeted range in the near-term. As clarity around the economic outlook increases,
we will look to further deploy capital through balance sheet growth and/or share repurchases.
Lastly, assuming no significant changes to the current tax environment, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to
25%. We've increased our focus and execution around various tax strategies, some of which were executed in
2020 and others that will be established over time that will provide opportunities to further reduce the effective tax
rate from current levels. For sensitivity purposes, a federal tax rate change from 21% to 28% would result in an
increase of our long-term effective tax rate of 6.5%. That would follow a one-time adjustment to the DTA that
would mitigate a portion of the impact in the first year.
Now, before we move to Q&A, let me close with a couple of comments. I am humbled and honored to be
presented with the opportunity to transition into the CEO role in April. Kessel has led this company with such a
steady hand over the last 10 years and has returned the company to a position of strength. With this handoff,
working with Kessel in his role as Executive Chairman of the Board, we will continue our unwavering path
forward.
And on the second point, as we evaluate our path forward, I am convinced our purpose-driven, advice-based
relationship approach complemented with innovative digital capabilities and functionality will provide a compelling,
differentiated value proposition in the crowded and competitive landscape we operate within. We will continue to

use Synovus Forward to set our vision and agenda for the transformational imperatives that are required to
ensure we execute and deliver on our short- and long-term business and financial objectives. 2021, despite the
uncertainties, will serve as our next step forward in achieving these goals.
And with that, operator, let me turn it over to you for Q&A.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
It's great to see the additional $75 million from the Synovus Forward. I was just wondering, roughly speaking, how
much of that benefit do you think will actually drop to the bottom line. I think I heard Jamie say that some of the
savings in the fourth quarter were reinvested maybe on the technology front. Should we be thinking about that
additional $75 million as all dropping to the bottom line or will some of that be reinvested into the franchise?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, this is Jamie. I'll kick this off and then hand it over to Kevin. The first thing I would just say is we're a
growth bank and our Synovus Forward efforts are intended to offset strategic spend in digital and technology and
other growth initiatives to help us deploy and kind of bring Synovus to more customers. And so, with regards to
the overall expenses, that $175 million, all of that is a top line benefit, however, we do have spends in other areas
that are increasing.
And so, what I hope you see in our 2021 guidance is the commitment to react to revenue pressures and we strive
for positive operating leverage in a challenging environment. And so, we think that as you look at 2021, you'll see
an approximate 4% or so benefit due to the Synovus Forward initiatives in calendar year 2021, and that helps us
have the ability to go out and spend on digital, on technology, on people to get us to where we need to be to
grow. And so, let me hand it to Kevin to give a little more detail on the Synovus Forward initiatives.

So, Brady, Jamie nailed it, it's top line initiatives that will generate the $175 million. But as we think about this, we
look at every investment from an ROI perspective. So, as we look at new opportunities, whether it'd be talent or
technology, we're going to make those investments if they have the right return on investment. The important
thing, as we've talked about in the past, is our other calibration factor will be top-quartile performance. So, as we
look at the $175 million, can we look at our capacity to reinvest, we're still focused on that top-quartile
performance which was based on ROTCE, ROA, and efficiency ratio, and it's fairly turbulent right now, so it's hard
to see what that number is, but we know with the $175 million that we've committed, we know we're moving in
that direction.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brady, the only other thing I would add is, as we look at the benefit of these initiatives and specifically on the
expense side, we obviously get the benefit of fourth quarter activity immediately, but the benefit will flow in over
the course of 2021, and we would expect the largest impact on the year-over-year declines to be in the second
half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, it was great to see the 2021 outlook on slide 13. The one thing that's missing
there is a provision guidance, which I know can be tough nowadays. Jamie, I heard you point to basically 25 basis
points in net charge-offs there in the first quarter. So, it seems like net charge-offs are going to be low. So, looking
at your reserve, you're at 180 basis points. I think your day-one CECL reserve was around like 100 to 110 basis
points. So, it feels like we're headed back there. But maybe just talk about how fast we could see reserve
releases in this year and next.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. The million-dollar question is how will this all play out. I mean, we obviously see a lot of uncertainty out
there, and I think you're right to look at day one CECL as a potential where we could land in a more normalized
environment, assuming no significant changes to loan mix in the loan portfolio. So, I think that that is reasonable. I
would just point to the uncertainty in the outlook. I mean when we look at credit and we thought about giving
guidance, typically we would give full-year guidance, but we only did the first quarter because of the uncertainty in
the outlook. And so, when we look at this year, when we look at 2021, we believe that they're very possible
scenarios where charge-offs remain stable all year long at current levels.
A scenario like that could include a vaccine – effective vaccine rollout, Phase 2 P3 success, future stimulus, a
strong economic recovery. But then there are also scenarios where we see charge-offs increase throughout the
year to more than double today's rate, and that could include COVID case increases, ineffective vaccine, no
stimulus, basically a slow or declining economy. And so, given how wide the range is between these hypothetical
scenarios, we just didn't think it was prudent to give full-year guidance. But we're committed to giving guidance as
we go through this year as we gain clarity on the outlook, but – obviously, we feel good about where we are, we
feel we're adequately reserved for this uncertainty, and we'll see how it goes as we move through the year.

Operator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess just first around the guidance for the revenue outlook. I was wondering if you can break it down a little bit
more for us in terms of fees versus NII and what your expectations are. I mean, mortgage banking was very, very
strong last year. How you're thinking about it? And on the NII side, Jamie, like when do you see core NII at least
[indiscernible] (00:40:05) for Synovus on a quarterly basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, let me start with fee revenue, and you're right, as we look at industry data on mortgage revenue in
2021, obviously, there will be a significant decline from 2020. Everybody is speaking to this, and I don't think we're
any different. And so, what you will see from us in fee revenue is, fee revenue will be down year-over-year, likely
in 2021 versus 2020, driven by an approximate 40% to 50% decline in mortgage revenue. And that more than
offsets this really strong broad-based growth in our other fee businesses. And so, it's unfortunate that it's
overshadowed just due to the strength in 2020 of mortgage, but we are really excited about the broad-based
growth we have in the core banking fees, fiduciary and asset management, including the Family Office that Kevin
mentioned earlier and brokerage. And so, that's what we expect in fee revenue as we go through 2021.
And then, with regard to NII, I'm glad you mentioned kind of core or stripping out the noise of P3, because that's
very important. And what I would say there is, as we look at NII, you should see a decline in the first quarter really
due to two things. First is day count, which you're obviously aware of, but second is fixed rate asset repricing
including an acceleration of prepayments in the securities book. And then, once we get past the first quarter, we
expect NII to be stable to slightly increasing throughout the year, as benefits from deposit repricing and loan
growth just outpace the headwinds of that fixed rate asset repricing.
With regards to the deposits, on the deposit side, we're obviously pleased with where we landed in the fourth
quarter. If you look at monthly data, we achieved our objective of prior cycle lows. And then, when we look
forward, we believe that we can get an incremental 7 basis points reduction in total deposit cost in the first half of
2021 of that 28 basis points for the fourth quarter just due to the maturities in our time deposit book. Obviously,
we see benefits as well between price and mix and non-maturity deposits, but we see more room to go there and
we're excited about those opportunities.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. That's helpful, Jamie. And just one question, I guess, Kevin, you spent a lot of time on technology
investments both in terms of back office, front office. Just talk to us in terms of, one, does this – like, how would
you pick Synovus relative to large regional peers, the big banks within your markets, like do you feel confident in
terms of the wherewithal of the franchise? And has all of this made you sort of look for like tuck-in acquisition
opportunities in the fee income on the technology side that we should anticipate over the next year or so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, it's a great question. I think before you start evaluating the functionality and capability, you all
must have to look first at what your customers are telling you. And if you look at Synovus customers, they have a
higher NPS scores or loyalty scores than most of the big bank peers. So, what we're providing them today are
making them satisfied with the offerings and making them very loyal to the company. And as we think about going
forward, the way that we're able to garner additional growth and relationships is from those referrals. So, I think
it's first important to look at what our customers are telling us.
As it relates to investments, we obviously saw the need to continue to improve the capabilities and functionality on
the digital front. We have My Synovus on the consumer side where we continue to provide enhanced customer
experiences. We've seen that with the scores that we've gotten online. We've also this past year rolled out
enhanced online origination capabilities. So, now our customers have the ability to originate more products from
the comfort of their home which is, obviously, with the pandemic something that we saw a shift in activity and we
feel like we're on par with being able to do that.
Our focus in first quarter, which Jamie touched on, is the expansion and the development of a new commercial
portal, which is called Synovus Gateway, and that's going to be, we believe, best-in-class as we relate to others in
terms of their cash management systems and their digital capabilities for business customers, and that's been a
big focus for us. We think we can win in that space, we have the right to win, and we think our technology will
continue to be improved over time. As we've told you in the past, the key here is making sure that you partner with
the right fintech and that you get the right sort of R&D that's happening at that company which allows you to
continue to enhance your offerings, and we feel like we're in a good position to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anything around M&A on the fee side, Kevin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, look, we look at all sorts of M&A as it relates to any sort of benefit that we would have for any
capability adds or new products and functionality. We've been focused on growth in fee income through the
treasury and wealth management businesses, and we've had good growth there, double-digit growth. And so,
we'll continue to leverage the investments we've already made. But if there's something that were to make sense
from an M&A standpoint, we would look at it. But right now we really believe the best investment we have is in
Synovus and continuing to leverage the talent and the technology and resources we have today, and we think
there is growth that will come from that in our marketplace as well. We feel like we're in one of the best footprints
in banking. So, we don't see currently a need to go out and have to use M&A to stimulate growth.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A

Hey, Jennifer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A

Hey, Jennifer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I think the key questions has been asked, but just a question on the second round of PPP.
What kind of borrowers are you seeing requesting applications at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Jennifer, this is Kevin. We're seeing, as Kessel mentioned, about 5,000 applications for right around $700
million. So, the average loan size is a little less than $150,000. So, similar borrowers to what we saw before.
Obviously, to qualify, you had to have a 25% reduction in revenue in 2020 and I think what we see with most of
our borrowers is that occurred early in the pandemic, the second quarter. But we've actually been pleased with
our process and how we've been able to get the applications onboarded. We've leveraged a third-party this time,
which I think will make us more efficient and effective. We're not having to use a lot of internal resources to get
that completed, but there's really been no surprises from a company standpoint or NAICS code or size, it's really
been just a subset of what we had expected from the initial withdrawals on P3. And so, as I said, right at 5,000
today, we had 19,000 in the initial phase, so a smaller percentage than maybe what you would expect at this
point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It absolutely does. One of the things that we've recognized, as you know, Jennifer, we've been able to
rightsize our branch network over the last 10 years. I think if you look at legacy Synovus branches, we've cut
almost 25% of the locations. But what you have to look at today is, when you look at our branches and you
evaluate what percentage of our branches are within three miles of one another and which percent of our
branches are less than $50 million in deposits, we have – relative to our competition, we have a lower
percentage. So, as we go forward, we will continue to look for ways to optimize the branch network, but we'll also
look at staffing levels, we'll look at size of branch locations, we'll look at two for ones. It will not be traditionally
there's just the consolidation of the branch network, because we feel like we've done a good job of that.
As it relates to corporate real estate, that was part of our initial assessment as an opportunity, and as we evaluate
the remote workforce environment and what the needs are going to be long-term, there will obviously be
opportunities there. But we're not waiting for that, we're taking the opportunity now to renegotiate rent and get
benefits from that, and so just rationalize the space that we're using. So, yes, both of those will be part of the
short-term and longer-term initiatives.

Jamie, I appreciate your comment about the desire maybe to grow the bond portfolio a little bit more with some of
your excess cash. Just curious if you could comment on maybe other moves on the other side of the balance
sheet, maybe specifically as it relates to the broker money market and the brokered time. It looks like the
brokered time accounts yield or costs were pretty much unchanged linked quarter. Just curious kind of when you
start to maybe see some movement there.
And then, anything else you can do on kind of the long-term debt side of things that was down on average quite a
bit, although, it look like the rate and dollar costs was up. So, just any additional color there or maybe other moves
on the right side of the balance sheet aside from just normal repricing?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Yeah. Great question, and obviously, by our actions in 2020, it's something you can see we're extremely focused
on. And when we look at on the brokered side, even in non-maturity, a lot of those are governed by terms. And
so, we don't have the flexibility necessarily to take those all when you would want to immediately. But on the CD
side, we have approximately $300 million maturing in the first quarter, a little more than $200 million in the second
quarter, and we'll continue just to let those run off. In the fourth quarter, you saw the expenses that were
associated with our debt kind of optimization and that included both the sub-debt as well as optimization of our
home loan bank exposures. And so, you'll continue to see us look at the right side of the balance sheet and
digging in on ways we can optimize our liabilities as we go forward in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then maybe a question for Kessel or Kevin, I appreciate the guidance around loan growth for the year,
particularly in the back half. Is there a way to quantify kind of based on the number of people that you've hired or
new verticals that you brought in sort of what your capacity is kind of based on what these folks had at their
previous institutions? Just kind of curious kind of what the – what you [indiscernible] (00:51:57) view as the bigger
picture opportunity based on all the hiring that you did, kind of pre-pandemic with those folks maybe getting off to
a slower start because of the pandemic. What's kind of the size of the pie that's out there for Synovus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Let's maybe try and tag team. I will let Kevin give a little more color. But I will say this, we had been super
excited about the level of talent that continues to be attracted I think to our operating model and to kind of our
history of how we serve customers. Kevin mentioned the relationship-centric approach of both in the private
wealth, in the middle market wholesale bank, in the CRE space. We had great talent adds over the last 12 months
to 18 months.
And then as we again stood up some of our specialty verticals, which Kevin talked more about, we have I think
additional capacity and certainly think that loan growth for this year will be back-half loaded just for a lot of factors,
but certainly pandemic vaccine, recovering economy. Kevin, maybe you could speak to any of those in particular
where you think we have outsized capacity again. I think – I think our specialty lending areas have really proven a
source of value, not just to us but to the marketplace in terms of how we've brought expertise there.
So Kevin, maybe you could go a little further detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. No, Kessel, it's a great point. I'll use some math to talk about I think where the opportunity is. And when you
think about just loan production, and I think this is a salient point, when you look at commercial loan production in
2020, we had funded production of right at $5 billion and that was down roughly 13% in 2020 versus 2019 largely
due to the pandemic.
So, if you just return 2021 to production levels that we observed in 2019, it would produce about $700 million of
incremental production. Now, that that sounds large in and of itself, but I think what's more important is to look at
where we were producing in the first quarter of 2020. And our commercial production in the first quarter came in
60% higher than where it was in first quarter of 2019. So, when you start putting quantification to what these
teams can do, you'll look at just returning production back to 2019 levels would be $700 million. And then if you
were to be able to sustain a 50% to 60% growth rate over time, obviously that growth becomes exponential.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
So, to Kessel's point, structured lending has been a great addition to our team. But even as we've added talent
within established areas like ABL or CRE or commercial real estate, you know there's lots of opportunities to grow
within mature products. This just brings on new talent. So across the board, we think that there is opportunity to
increase the production and get it at levels much higher than what we would have had back in 2019.

Brad Milsaps Q

That's helpful. And I assume that all – that all plays into your – the additional $75 million that you're looking for in
2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's part of it. You know, obviously we've said that you know new talent and growth on the balance sheet; growth
in fee income would be a component of that. But it's not what we're making the $75 million bet on. But it's part of
that forecast.

I wanted to start – so with all of the initiatives underway, you seem to be building a better mousetrap on the digital
side to acquire new customers. You're also in great markets. When should we start to see revenue growth trends

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Steve, this is Jamie. I guess what I would point to is the growth in the core business. Our headwind right now
on revenue, when you look at growth, is a couple of things. One is interest rate sensitivity and the impact of rates
on the book. And that's a headwind on NII and that slight downward pressure and kind of core when you back out
the impact of P3, that's a little bit of a headwind, and you'll start to see loan growth and the deposit costs more
than offsetting that as we get into 2021.
And then we feel really good about our fee revenue growth. We're doing year-over-year comparisons. We have
the kind of headwind this year in 2021 of a really strong mortgage performance in 2020. And so, we feel good
about the components. We feel good about longer term loan growth. We believe that we can grow faster than the
economies in our market – in our five-state footprint, which we believe will grow faster than the general US
economy. And so, we feel good about our revenue growth based on those factors but we do have that headwind
of NII just due to rate sensitivity.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Well we...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You know, that's a tough question to answer, because you have all the branch team members. But we in back
office, you know there's – I would tell you that there's 60% of our team member base that's in some sort of
frontline capacity. And if you look at over the last several years where we have been adding resources has been
on the frontline and we've been taking cost out of the back office through automation, optimization.

commercial banking before we would in a well space just because it may have a quicker payback.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess, when you look at the expense guidance as the base that we should be using the full year $1.09 billion, $1
billion adjusted or is that really our 4Q annualized $275 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Full year adjusted.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then when we look at that $4.5 million, as you called out of Synovus Forward, PPP, and COVID-
related expenses that's still on the adjusted. I guess, what's the timing for that to roll off? Is that just really
dependent upon full back to work, back to normal economy, or is that more of a specific to fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. The Synovus Forward upfront third-party expenses are initiative- specific. And so, those are individual and
you can think about those per initiative that we choose to pursue. And so, those – think about those that way. On
the COVID-related and P3 fees, the fees we have in the fourth quarter are related to the forgiveness process of
Phase 1.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
In 2021, you will see some fees associated with both the origination and forgiveness of the second phase of the
Paycheck Protection Program. The upfront origination fee will be embedded in loan yields. So, they will not show
up in expenses but the forgiveness fees will show up as you see them in the last quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just shifting back to the allowance, I appreciate the comments you made around that. I
guess when we look at the ratio; it's still pretty high compared to peers. And it seems like you have some
qualitative overlays in there. I guess what could be the main drivers of lowering that ratio faster or is it just second
half GDP accelerating above sort of a consensus estimate or is it just more once you all get comfortable with that
potentially lower loss content, we could see those qualitative overlays reduce.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's the right way to think about it is that as we get into this year and as we look at the economic outlook and
get more comfort and confidence that the base case scenario is what's going to play out, that'll reduce the
uncertainty that's embedded in our allowance. And our allowances 12/31, it does not have any future stimulus in
it. It does not have a lot of the things that are being discussed today as benefits to the general economy. So, we'll
constantly reassess our calculations and our estimates. But I think you're thinking about it the right way.

I know you indicated that the – when you were discussing the Synovus Forward program that a lot of that is
revenue, but the backbone really here is – the projection is for positive operating leverage longer term. So, can
you give us an idea, in your modeling, in your expectations, what is the timing that you see returning to positive
operating leverage?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, John, as we've mentioned, that's an important priority for us and we believe that we have a shot at positive
operating leverage in 2021 year-over-year on adjusted revenue and adjusted expenses. It's not a lay-up. There's
a lot of effort that will go into that, both on the expense and revenue side. But that's our objective. And so, you see
that in our guidance when we say that we expect revenues to be down 1% to 4%, expenses to be down 2% to
5%, that's what we're shooting for. Now, look it's early in the year and there's a lot of work to do to achieve it, but
that's our objective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yes. Thanks. And just given the ranges are somewhat wide, so wanted to clarify.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Then on – and then on the capital return front, I know you indicated that the priority is organic and that you're
going to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases. So, if you could just maybe help elaborate a little
bit around the potential timing about when you step back into the market and buyback stock given you have the
authorization? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes, John. You know, as we think about our capital management framework and philosophy, you know I'm going
to go back and just look back at 2020. We feel really good about performance in a challenging environment,
starting the year at 8.95% CET1 and first quarter dropping down to 8.70% due to customer loan growth and now
being about 100 basis points higher at year-end.
We feel really good about that, and we feel good about how we got there through stable PPNR, stable – you know
strong credit performance and active balance sheet management. So, we feel really good about our process and
our framework, and how we as management, respond to those environments. But in today's environment, we do
believe it's prudent to operate with higher capital than we felt a year ago, operating at the high-end of the range at
9% to 9.5%.
We also believe that our common equity dividend at $0.33 a quarter is appropriate for 2021. But you know, so
we're pleased with where we are. We believe that our balance sheet, both capital and liquidity are positioned for
us to achieve success in 2021 and be ready for customer loan growth. And so, we feel good about that as well.
And that's our priority, is to deploy that capital to loan growth.
But as you are well aware, today we're at [ph] 970 bps, our target is 950 bps (01:05:18) and we're above it. And
so we're going to think about how do we deploy capital above our target. Again, the priority is customer loan
growth. But if that's not there for us, then we'll look at share repurchases. But we're going to be patient and
opportunistic. We do not expect to buy shares in the first quarter but we will be looking at that as we proceed
through 2021.

Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jamie. And then just lastly if I could ask, I know on slide 3, you walked through your
adjusted ROTCE and about 9.1% for 2020. 2019 was clearly in the mid-teen to 16%. How should we think about
your updated thoughts on your appropriate long-term ROTCE as trends ultimately normalize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
John, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we believe that there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but we also believe that the
$175 million we have in for Synovus Forward will help us get to top quartile. And so, we don't believe that there's
enough clarity in the economic and environmental outlook today to be able to give a good return on tangible or
ROA estimate over the long run. If you look at the rate curve, it remains flat for a very extended period of time.
And so, as we get more clarity on the outlook, we'll give more clarity on our longer term return targets or where
expect to be. But at the moment, we just think it's more prudent to just be clear that we're targeting top quartile.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And John, just to add that the pace in which we get there, that's our focus. Maybe not so focused on the
destination and what the number is, but making sure that we're putting the initiatives in place and getting the
incremental performance that allows us to grow faster at a relative pace.

Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ken, that's a great question. You know, I mean for the fourth quarter we're sitting here at 28 basis points. I
mentioned that we can get another 7 basis points in the first half of 2021 just due to time deposits alone.
Obviously, we'll get benefits from nonmaturity deposits and mix as well, which could get you another 2 or 3 basis
points from there. But so, I would say that in the next 12 months, 10 basis points is certainly reasonable. And
we're trying everything we can to get it lower.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. And then just one follow-up, just as a clarification question. Your comments that you would expect
a modest downward pressure on NII and NIM in the first quarter, does that exclude all PPP fees?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Yes. And so – it does. And Ken, just a little more color on that. In our slide deck, we mentioned that we have
$20 million in fees in-process at year-end. But just to be clear, there's also the normal fee amortization that will
happen in the first quarter there, other loans that could go through the forgiveness process in the middle of the
quarter, we would expect in the first quarter to potentially have approximately $30 million in P3 fee realization.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
I just want to go back to the loan growth. I just wanted to get a sense – I appreciate you sort of gave some, I
guess, numbers around how 1Q stacked up this year and what it would look like if you got back to last year kind
of levels. But just wanted to get a sense for how loan pipelines stack up currently relative to the year-ago period
and maybe during the middle of the pandemic? And then, the expectation for paydowns, are those to remain
elevated in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So this is Kevin. So let me first start with the paydowns and payoffs. Although the fourth quarter was
elevated from second and third quarter, when you look at 2020 for the year, payoffs and paydowns were in line
with previous year's and expectations. So what fourth quarter was, was just maybe some lower payoffs and
paydowns that would have occurred in the second/third quarter that were just pushed back into the fourth quarter.
So as we look into 2021, we don't expect payoffs and paydowns to be in an elevated level.
As it relates to production, I mean, very clearly, our growth for 2021 will come from our commercial business. We
believe that we can get mid-single digit growth in both core C&I and core CRE growth. And that comes from, as I
mentioned earlier, just having increased levels of production.
The pipelines, to your question, are not fully back to where they were pre-pandemic. And in the fourth quarter, our
commercial production was actually down about 30% year-over-year. So it has trailed off based on the underlying
economic environment. But all of our line leaders are seeing folks come back into the pipeline with new projects
and new opportunities. And so, we expect for those to continue to build throughout the year, as Jamie mentioned,
probably, more so to the second half of the year.
And then, I also just want to remind you that Jamie touched on the third-party retail partnerships. We currently
have right around $675 million in third-party partnerships. As you know, historically, we've operated right around
$2 billion. So we have capacity with our liquidity and capital profile to be able to go out and make some purchases
from third-party, if they meet our hurdles from a profitability and a return perspective.
So as you think about loan growth for next year, I'm fairly bullish that we can produce at the higher end of the
range just based on the fact that production will return throughout the year. If utilization were to normalize, as I
said in my prepared remarks, just getting back to normal levels, there would be $650 million. And we have some
dry powder as it relates to third-parties. So we feel confident that we can deliver on our loan guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one more on Synovus Forward. I appreciate the timeline you put in the
deck. I just wanted to get some clarification that the $60 million annualized in the first half 2021, is that more, I
guess, heavily weighted towards the rest of the expense capture, expense save that you need to do? And then as
the $100 million in the second half 2021, is that more based on the revenue enhancements?
And then, I guess, you gave sort of some indication that it's going to be more heavily weighted towards revenue
on the additional $75 million. But I guess, I wanted to better understand how much of that is going to be driven by
new hires, I guess, on the fee side or is it more on the loan origination side that's going to help with those revenue
enhancements in 2022?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I'll jump in on the timing and then hand to Kevin about the hires. When we look at the timing, what I would say is
that first $100 million is kind of a two-third/one-third split with expenses being two-thirds of the first $100 million.
And then, that reverses for the $75 million. And so, for the $75 million, it's approximately two-thirds revenue and
one-third expense. And obviously, all of that is in progress and in process. We have workstreams identified, but
not [ph] ticked off (01:13:47) for that. And so, it could evolve. But that's how we look at it today.
Kevin, I'll hand to you for the hire side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So look, I don't want you leaving thinking that there's a great deal of expense for new hires that would be
required to generate the revenue growth. Two big components of revenue growth and one that we haven't started
yet is on the analytical front. As I mentioned, we've started the commercial analytics, and we believe that's going
to give our frontline bankers a tremendous opportunity to cross-sell within the existing book. We will, in the
second quarter, roll out the same project for retail analytics. And so, that's going to provide our private wealth and
our retail bankers the opportunity to do the same.
And so, much of the revenue that we see in the future is just continuing to leverage that analytical platform to be
able to sell deeper into the relationships we already have as well as reduce the level of attrition. So there's not a
tremendous amount of revenue at risk if we do not bring in new team members.
Now within our guidance for this year with the reduction in expenses, we are still planning to add new producers
into our high-growth areas, whether that'd be market-specific, whether it'd be in our wholesale banking area,
whether it'd be in specialty or just the middle-market banker. So we are continuing to invest broadly in talent that
can give us the proper returns and we'll do that. But the $75 million is not predicated on a bunch of new hires to
be able to get there.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just wanted to talk about your excess liquidity. I think it's around $3 billion. What's the pace that we should expect
that to wind down each quarter? And are you planning just to redeploy that into the securities book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So it's a great question and one we debate daily. As we look at 2021 and think about what to do with excess
liquidity, first off, our base case forecast would have deposits declining. We didn't give official guidance on that
because it's highly uncertain, to look at future stimulus possibilities, the Paycheck Protection Program round two,
all of those could materially impact deposits.
And so, it's difficult to know exactly what that'll look like this year. As we mentioned earlier, we do expect to
increase the securities portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we were between 14% to 15% of total assets in the
securities portfolio. In 2021, I would expect to grow that to between 16% to 17% of total assets with the majority of
that happening in the first quarter. And so, we will deploy some of that excess liquidity there.
As Kevin mentioned, we do believe that we have opportunities in our third-party lending portfolio. That is a
portfolio that we view as a surrogate for the investment portfolio. And so, the way we think about that is we get
increased spread in exchange for incremental risk. And that incremental risk is credit, liquidity and marketability.
And with what we experienced in 2020 with the sale of the student loan portfolio, realization of a gain there, with
the restructuring of our largest third-party relationship that derisked that portfolio, all of that just tells us that we
really think that we have a strong framework in this portfolio and it truly is a surrogate for the investment portfolio.
So as Kevin mentioned, that's an opportunity for us to consume some of this excess liquidity. But that's how we're
thinking about it. Obviously, the number one priority is customer growth, and that's our first and foremost
objective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Appreciate that. And the third-party portfolio, that was around $630 million in the fourth quarter. Is that
right?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's right. That's right. As you look at – as Kevin mentioned, on 12/31/2019, we were right at $2 billion in third-
party loans on balance sheet. And right now, you're spot on at over $600 million, just over $600 million on loans
held for investment on balance sheet. We also have the held-for-sale portfolio, but we view that differently. That's
a different risk profile. And so, we have really reduced the loans on balance sheet in the HFI portfolio. And we
believe that there's definitely opportunity to grow that portfolio in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
So I guess, maybe, just an extension of this. By the fourth quarter, do you expect your excess liquidity to be
around $2 billion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a challenging thing to forecast, just given all the different flows and how we see 2021. I believe that liquidity
will remain elevated. We're going to do everything we can to manage that including reducing broker deposits that
we thought about earlier. But I think it'd be pretty tough to give a good answer for the fourth quarter of 2021
excess liquidity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No, fully understand that. And then just the last one. Just on the $45 million revenue benefit from Synovus
Forward, about how much of that is coming from fees versus NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So in the first round, we said it would be $45 million. We have three primary initiatives in there. Number one is our
pricing for value. As I said on the call, about $10 million of the benefit there will come in through fee income,
through repricing to market levels, our treasury payment solution solution. The second is on new product offering
that we've rolled out. Merchant services, we brought it in-house. And so, that will all be fee-income related.
And then the third and the more difficult one to assess is this commercial analytics where we put a $20 million
benefit there. That comes from cross-selling and reducing attrition. And so, cross-selling to our existing book
could come from extending additional credit. It could come from depository. So there will be an NII component.
But a large component of the ability to cross-sell will be on the treasury and payment solutions side. I think about
70% of the leads that we get out of this system are treasury and payment solutions related. So I would assume
that a large portion of that revenue will also come in through the service charge line or fee income line.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Just a quick one. I know you talked about the M&A environment and not being interested in that. I'm
just curious from a, perhaps, venture capital or just general investment standpoint, does fintech interest you at all
from that deployment of cash? You have some unique history in payments in fintech, that's why I asked.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, I'll jump in on that. This is Jamie. As we look at those – you're right. We have a very unique history
and a unique expertise. And so, that definitely plays into it. But a lot of times, when you look at the financials and
the valuations, it's challenging to make those work to bring it into a bank because, generally, and not always, but
generally, their valuation is based on their ability to sell to other banks. And if you bring it in-house, it makes that
difficult. And the value to the buyer is a fraction of what the value is of that company when they can sell across the
country.
And so, that's typically what makes the math difficult. But is the type of thing that we look at. As Kevin mentioned
earlier, if there is technology that we can deploy to serve our customers better, to add a product, that is definitely
something we would consider. It's just you have to find the right fit to make the valuation work.

Well, thank you very much. And thanks to everyone for your questions and for your time today.
In closing, I think, 2020, again, proved the valuable role banks play in our communities and in our economy. In my
entire career, I'm not sure I've ever been more proud of our profession. And I'm especially grateful to be part of an
organization that was already well-positioned with strong talent and longtime local relationships to respond when
and where needed throughout the year. It's certainly been a trying season for everyone. And while we in no way
celebrate the difficulties that have been life-altering for so many and that created challenges our team is still
working to overcome, it has been inspiring to again watch our bankers, our advisors, and support teams kick into
action 24/7, caring for each other and those we serve. This might have been our finest hour so far, and there's so
much more to come.
We're looking confidently towards the future with the right talent and the right growth strategies leading the way to
become an even better bank. And we're just so well-positioned for 2021 and the years beyond with a strong
balance sheet, with higher levels of capital and liquidity and strong credit quality, with a strong operating model,
