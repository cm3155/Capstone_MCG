Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I'd like to start by
thanking our teams across the company for the strong execution throughout the year in the face of significant
global political and market turmoil. It is our partners' unwavering focus on supporting our clients in uncertain and
volatile times like these that truly differentiates Northern Trust.
For the full year, revenue was up 5% including trust fee growth of 2% and our return on average Common Equity
was 12.7%. Excluding the impact of $303 million in charges detailed in the presentation, revenue for the full year
grew 8% and our return on equity was 14.9%.
Fourth quarter results reflected trends that were consistent with those we saw through the first three quarters of
the year. Namely, on a year-over-year basis, weaker markets pressured our trust fees, but this was more than
offset by strong increases in net interest income.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Within our Wealth Management business, assets under management and advisory fees grew sequentially in the
fourth quarter. Total fees declined however, due to the lagged effect of markets, strategic price reductions in our
index funds and shifts in client allocations out of liquidity products.
Overall, new business generation in Wealth Management was healthy in 2022. However, we did see some
deceleration in the second half of the year as market activity waned. We continue to execute on our growth
strategy in Wealth Management, including increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force, expanding our
digital marketing efforts, and leveraging the differentiated capabilities of The Northern Trust Institute.
In asset management, assets under management were up sequentially, but fees declined due to the outflows we
experienced in our liquidity and index products as a result of the impact of both weaker markets and clients
seeking alternatives. We did see solid increases in alternative funds throughout the year, including year-over-year
growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our ETF complex also continued to perform well with year-over-
year organic growth to 12%.
Our product launches during the year focused on ESG capabilities, including three new ESG funds in the fourth
quarter.
And within Asset Servicing, we delivered a solid finish to the year. We saw healthy momentum throughout the
year with our Whole Office offering as investment managers are increasingly considering outsourced solutions in
the face of continued margin pressure and the challenging macroeconomic environment.
Whole Office integrates our global asset servicing platform with innovative partners facilitating access to new
technologies, services and solutions. One recent client win offers an insight into what differentiates us in the
marketplace. After an exhaustive RFP process during which we conducted a complete review of a large UK-
based asset manager front-to-back operating model, we were selected to provide a holistic full suites of core
asset servicing capital markets and data and analytics products and services.
This client was particularly impressed with our ability to digitalize their investment process to maximize the value
of their data. We learned that this client chose us because of our combination of market-leading tools and first-
rate client service. We also saw continued strong demand for our Integrated Trading Solutions offering throughout
both the quarter and the year. In 2022, the number of clients on the platform increased 20% year-over-year to
nearly 100. Our [ph] one bit knot (00:05:10) transition backlog that we spoke to you about last quarter, started to
transition in during the fourth quarter and our pipeline remained strong. Expense growth continued to be elevated
in the quarter, reflecting investments in people and technology to strengthen our resiliency, advanced our digital
modernization effort, and drive growth in the business. All critical initiatives, but the level of growth is too high.
Some of the charges we announced today reflect early steps we are taking to bring down the trajectory to better
align with the current operating environment and create capacity for profitable growth. To underscore our
commitment, we recently launched a dedicated office of productivity to reinforce our approach to driving
efficiencies throughout the company. Jason will provide more color on in his prepared remarks.
In closing, as we begin 2023, we remain well positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market
uncertainty from a position of strength. Our focus is on driving organic growth, improving our productivity, and
continuing to bolster our foundation.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Jason J. Tyler
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call.
Dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net
income of $155.7 million. Earnings per share were $0.71, and our return on average Common Equity was 5.9%.
Our results were unfortunately impacted by the inclusion of $266 million in pre-tax charges, which reflect $199
million in net income impact and $0.94 in earnings per share impacts.
These charges included the following on a pre-tax basis: $213 million of investment security losses related to the
intent to sell certain available-for-sale debt securities, which were subsequently sold in early January; $32 million
of severance-related charges; $14 million of occupancy charges related to early lease exits, and $6.8 million of
pension settlement charges. Also recall that in the first quarter of this year, we implemented an accounting
reclassification of certain fees which continues to impact the year-over-year comparisons as noted on this page.
Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Including the charges previously
mentioned, year-over-year revenue was down 8%, the expenses increased 13% and net income was down 62%.
In a sequential comparison, revenue was down 13%, expenses were up 8%, while net income was down 61%.
Excluding the charges previously mentioned, year-over-year, revenue was up 5% and expenses increased 9%.
Excluding the charges previously mentioned, on a sequential basis, revenue was down 1% and expenses were
up 5%.
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Year-over-year, unfavorable currency
translation reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Trust, investment, and other servicing
fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1 billion and were down 6% from last year and
down 3% sequentially.
Our trust fees continue to be unfavorably impacted by the weaker equity and fixed income markets and
unfavorable currency movements. As a reminder, a significant portion of our trust fees are recorded on a month or
quarter lag basis. So, this quarter's performance is largely reflective of the third quarter's market performance as
well as the months of October and November. The year-over-year and sequential declines in all other remaining
noninterest income are primarily driven by the $213 million pre-tax investment security loss due to the intent to
sell certain available-for-sale debt securities.
These securities were subsequently sold in early January 2023, which I'll describe in more detail in a few minutes.
Net interest income on an FTE basis, which I'll also discuss in more detail later, was $550 million and was up 48%
from a year ago and up 5% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Asset Servicing business, fees
totaled $588 million and were down 6% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Within Asset Servicing,
custody and fund administration fees were $406 million, down 11% year-over-year but, importantly, they were flat
sequentially.
Custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to unfavorable markets
and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by new business. Assets under custody and administration
for Asset Servicing clients were $13 trillion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The
year-over-year decline was primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation The sequential
increase was primarily driven by favorable markets and currency translation.

Investment management fees within Asset Servicing were $124 million, up 9% year-over-year and down 9%
sequentially. Investment management fees decreased sequentially, primarily due to asset outflows and
unfavorable market. Investment management fees increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower
money market fund fee waivers, partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets.
Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $898 billion, down 25% year-over-year and up 3%
sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by asset outflows, weaker equity in fixed income markets and
unfavorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency
translation, partially offset by asset outflows
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $454 million, down
7% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year
declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and asset outflows, partially offset by the
elimination of money market fund fee waivers.
Sequentially, the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets, asset outflows, and a
strategic repricing initiative. Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee
waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. The sequential decrease was mainly related to
asset outflows, unfavorable markets and the repricing initiative.
Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $351 billion at quarter end, down 16% year-
over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by unfavorable
markets and asset outflows. The sequential increase was primarily due to favorable markets.
Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $550 million in the quarter and was up 48% from the prior year.
Earning assets averaged $134 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus the prior year. Average deposits were
$116 billion and were down 14% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $42 billion, up 6%
compared to the prior year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 5%. Average earning assets were up 1%. Average
deposits declined 2%, while average loan balances were up 2%. The net interest margin was 1.63% in the
quarter, up 64 basis points from a year ago and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The prior year quarter
increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher
average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix.
Turning to page 7. On a year-over-year basis, expense growth benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to
currency translation. As reported, expenses were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, 13% higher than the prior year
and 8% higher than the prior quarter. The current quarter's expenses included $53 million in charges. These
charges, in part, reflect steps we're taking in conjunction with the launch of our office of productivity, to shift away
we approach and manage our expenses. Through this initiative, we expect to leverage data and analytics to help
us better understand the efficacy of our spending so as to optimize our cost base and drive greater efficiencies
throughout the organization. We'll update you on our progress in the coming quarters as appropriate.
Excluding charges in both periods, expenses in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 5%
sequentially. Also, recall that the current quarter includes the impact of the previously mentioned accounting
reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $8.6 million compared to the prior year.

Compensation expense was up 15% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year
growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures and the previously
mentioned severance-related charges, partially offset by favorable currency translation. The sequential increase
is primarily to the aforementioned severance related charges and higher salary expense, partially offset by lower
incentives.
Employee benefits expense was down 4% compared to the prior quarter and down 6% sequentially. The year-
over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower ongoing pension expense, partially offset by higher medical
costs. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower pension costs, including the lower pension settlement
charge relative to the prior period, partially offset by higher medical costs.
Outside services expense was $233 million and was up 4% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The year-
over-year increase was primarily driven by higher technical service costs, legal services and consulting services,
partially offset by lower third party advisory fees and subcustodian expense. The sequential increase was
primarily due to higher technical services costs and legal services, partially offset by lower subcustodian expense
and consulting costs.
Equipment and software expense of $229 million was up 17% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-
over-year and sequential growth were both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments
in technology, as well as inflationary pressures and higher amortization. We also recognized a $3.8 million
termination charge associated with our mainframe strategy.
Occupancy expense of $66 million, was up 27% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-over-year
and sequential growth were both primarily driven by the previously mentioned $14 million of charges related to
early lease exits. Other operating expense of $108 million was up 37% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher staff-related expense, business promotion and
miscellaneous expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher business promotion, supplemental
compensation plan expense and miscellaneous expenses in the current period.
Turning to the full year, our results in 2022 are summarized on page 8. On the right margin of this page, we
outlined the charges that we called out for both years. Included these items, net income was $1.3 billion, down
14% compared to 2021, and earnings per share were $6.14, down 14% from the prior year. In 2022, these
charges had a $227 million impact on net income and a $1.08 impact on earnings per share. In 2021, these
charges had an $18 million impact on net income and $0.07 impact on earnings per share.
Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page 9, and include the charges previously mentioned.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 2% in 2022. The growth during the year was primarily driven by
lower money market fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets and unfavorable
currency translation.
Net interest income grew 36%. Average earning assets during the year decreased by 10% while the net interest
margin increased 64 basis points, driven by higher average interest rates. The net result was revenue growth of
5% in 2022 compared to 2021, and expense growth of 10%. Excluding these charges in both periods, revenue for
the full year was up 8% from the prior year, and expenses were up 9%.
Turning to page 10, our capital ratios remained strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% under the
standardized approach, up from the prior quarter's 10.1%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, up from 7% in the
prior quarter. A decrease in net unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio and less foreign

exchange volatility were the primary factors in this quarter's increase in capital ratios. Accumulated other
comprehensive income at the end of the quarter was a loss of $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we returned $158.9 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158.8 million
and share repurchases of $0.1 million. In early January of this year, we sold $2.1 billion of higher capital-
consuming, lower-yielding non-HQLA debt securities and reinvested the proceeds into lower capital-consuming,
higher-yielding HQLA assets. This repositioning offered a unique opportunity to de-risk our portfolio, free up
capital, and improve our liquidity ratios while simultaneously generating more attractive returns.
With that, Marjorie, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to allow the opportunity to
signal for questions but while we do, we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. So, I guess, I'll try to focus on deposits. So, the interest-bearing down 12%, the noninterest-
bearing down 48% year-on-year. But there's a clear declining impact on a sequential basis. So, I'm curious, a
much higher rate paid and a slow – and a decelerating outflow of deposits, how do we – can you help us think
through what to expect in 2023 on both attrition mix and betas for deposits? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, let me – there's a lot going on with the balance sheet, with the repositioning as well. So, let me give
you a couple of the key ingredients and then let me know if there's additional detail you'd like. So, just on volume,
we saw volume up at – down last to $116 billion, we still think that that $110 billion to $115 billion is a good
starting point for first quarter.
And as you know, the quarters have some seasonality. We usually get a spike at the end of fourth quarter. First
quarter gets some build from tax preparation. And in the second quarter, we'll start to see outflows as clients pay
taxes. But, as you think about first quarter at least $110 billion to $115 billion still a good range.
Then, let me take beta in three different and – or rate really in three different parts. First beta and you noted that
beta was high. We'd indicated we thought it would be at this point in the cycle, and we still think that that's a pretty
good indication of what it will look like over the course of the next three months. So, beta for interest-bearing
deposits was 75%, 80%. It was in line, we do anticipate that to be similar.
Balance sheet repositioning, that takes $2 billion – a little bit more at what was about 2% or 2.25% then reinvest it
on the short end of the curve a couple hundred basis points higher. Right now, we're mostly overnight. But, we'll
8


Northern Trust Corp.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
continue to think about what we want to do with that from a non-HQLA perspective. But at least the starting point
you should be thinking about is moving that $2 billion to overnight.
And then just lastly, as we're talking about rate, just a quick reminder, the one-off on the portfolio is just over $1
billion and you're moving that from 2%, 2.25% to higher rates. We're repositioning as we mature securities to the
short end. So, there's a similar pickup there.
And then last thing, on outlook, just as you think about first quarter is just remember that day count costs us about
$8 million going from fourth quarter to first quarter. So, those were the big ingredients. Hopefully, that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Wow. That's well prepared. Thank you. Appreciate it. And maybe just follow-up is similar question on average
earning assets, up 1% quarter-on-quarter. Should we feel in the range of stable now or, I guess...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's hard to tell. I mean, I think about it very much from where – obviously, as you know, it's a liability driven
balance sheet and so the commentary on deposits is really what's driving the size of average earning assets in
general. And what we saw in the quarter, it certainly does look like things have – that like client behavior has
settled and leveled out a little bit. But we're not calling it flat at this point. We're still operating in a way that we're
anticipating some muted but continued decline. That's why that $110 billion to $115 billion, that's really the – you
should think of that as the driver of average earning assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
So, I heard all the commentary around the expenses and the efforts to kind of slow the growth rate as we go
forward here. But maybe you could help us understand maybe the pace at which you think you can do that.
Because when I strip out the onetimers from the expense ratio, it still looks like the expense ratio moved up a bit
around 400 basis points Q-on-Q. So, how should I think about the trajectory from here? Does it stabilize where it
is? Is there still some pushup from here, or should we expect that the arc begins to come down in 1Q? How
should we think through that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, it's not – it doesn't stay where it is and it certainly doesn't – doesn't increase over time. That expense ratio
needs to come down. It's pretty good you're talking about assumed expense to trust fee.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
And so, a few – yeah, a few things to think about, one, and we can get into more detail on it. But in the short run,
at least, from an expense perspective, as we think about what first quarter is going to look like, I can give you
some thoughts there just as you start to model out what does it look like.
Compensation is obviously our biggest line and so we've got to start there. And so, we've got the $30 million
which you indicated even pulling that out, and so what does that look like going forward? We actually think that, in
general, that line item should start to flatten out in the near term as some of those severance-related activities
come online and we should get a benefit from that. To your question on timing, we should get a benefit on it this
year. We're not going to get a benefit of it right away, but a significant portion – more than half of the actions we're
going to take with severance we're anticipating to take place first in the – by the end of the first quarter. So, we're
going to start to see benefit of that.
We're going to backfill some of those roles, but they're not going to be in expensive locations. This is less about
us addressing FTE or head count, and it's getting at what the economics are, which is the salary run rate line for
the business showing up in comp, and we're going to get a benefit of that this year.
And so as you think about first quarter, don't forget that we've also got retirement-eligible incentives coming
online. That hits $50 million in that quarter, but that's very predictable and seasonal. The other dynamics for
compensation, I'd call it a wash as we think about going into the first quarter.
And then equipment and software is where we've seen a big uplift over the last couple of years. And we've talked
a few weeks ago externally about the fact that we thought that line would be at about $225 million. It came in
higher than that at $229 million. But that difference – 100% of that is the – $3.8 million is a contract termination we
decided to do very late in the quarter. Otherwise, we feel like that line item is starting to flatten out as well.
We will have a step-up as we come into first quarter. But we think beyond that, that line item is going to flatten
out. That's obviously where all of our depreciation is. But, we're going to see an uplift of about $12 million in first
quarter in equipment and software, 100% of that coming from depreciation and amortization. But other than that,
we're anticipating that line item to start to flatten out. We're not going to see this kind of growth going forward. And

then the other side of it is as we think about trust fees and growth in the business, that's going to help the ratio
that you started with as well.
Mike, I don't know if you want to talk just more strategically about how you're thinking about this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, I would just add, Betsy, to your point, it is about trajectories and curves, if you will. So, we've been on a
downward trajectory with trust fees as a result of the factors that Jason has gone through. Obviously, we're trying
to drive that the other way primarily through growth.
When it comes to NII, we've had a strong trajectory up. That's not likely to carry through into the new year or into
2023 just as a result of the rate cycle. And then looking at the expenses, as Jason went through there, we're
clearly trying to bend down that expense growth curve, without a doubt, through the productivity office but also
just in every day in how we operate the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And that curve bend downwards sounds like it's a second half – like we'll see that more in second half than in first.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, I think that's right because, as Jason is saying, some of these things, there's actions that we already took in
the fourth quarter, which we had talked about on the previous call, the intent to get going on those and then more
of them that are happening in the first quarter as well and then carrying through. So you're right, by the time you
see the impact, it's delayed relative to the action.

Excuse me. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well. Hoping to get some more specifics here. So, the
productivity office, helpful that we're seeing that emerge. But, like, what are the objectives, right? So, what are the
11

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
metrics that they're looking to drive? You gave some generally kind of high level comments on how to think about
bending the curve and whatnot there in response to Betsy's question.
But really expenses have been a bit out of control, just being blunt, especially relative to the peer group and
especially relative to the revenue trends. So, investors are really – I'm getting hit a lot this morning – looking for
some more details, better understanding and what specific metrics you're using and how we can make sure, too,
that you're hitting your goals when you're pushing through to make these changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I can – first of all, the thing that we look at to litmus test how we're doing from an expense management
perspective is still expense to trust fees. And even pulling out the charges from this quarter, being anywhere near
120%, that's not where the business is going to be in the long run. That's going to come down. And so, then you
start to think more tactically, how does the productivity office look to do that. Just to say what are the numbers
associated with it? Historically, we've talked about productivity matching inflation, and when inflation was at 1% or
2%, we felt like we were doing that really well. And with inflation at 8% or 9%, we are not going to get productivity
to that level, but we should absolutely have productivity above 2% of our expense base.
Second, every group in this company has productivity goals. We go through it all the time, every year in our
planning process. And then next, if you start to just think tactically, how is this office going to get this work? Where
are the buckets that we're going to get at? I'll give you how the group is laid out.
First of all, it's technology. That's the largest component of our – and the fastest-growing expense item we have.
That's $1.4 billion. And so, we have to – we've got to get at technology costs. We accomplished a lot in 2022 and
2021, but we've got to do it efficiently. And that means determining how we're purchasing, how we're developing
technology, how we're consuming it, how we're delivering it. Two is vendor strategy and how we're thinking about
engaging with our partners externally. Three, investment governance. There are areas around the company
where we're investing in growth for the business, we're investing to get deeper and stronger. But we've got to
accomplish those things but at the same time test whether or not we still want to be investing at the same rate, at
the same timing.
And then lastly, fourth is – a big pillar is workforce analysis. And a couple things there that's – you already see us
getting at larger severance than we normally take. And that should get to 300 or 400 positions that will be
impacted. That's why we're focused on driving productivity across operations. And then even separately than this,
we took out hundreds of technology-related contractors in fourth quarter, and just as an indication of how
aggressively we're getting at this internally, and that's a big effort to do that. But again, we accomplished a lot,
and now it's time to turn the corner on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And Brennan, I would just add. I think Jason described it well. But think about it as a bottoms-up and top-
down, right, which is each of the groups, as Jason say, they have to have their productivity initiatives that work
their way up to their productivity goals that are in the plan. And then the top-down part is the productivity office,
which is doing things they can cut across the enterprise and also have the structure to work with the groups to
help them meet those productivity initiatives. So, that's the approach to it. And again, this is – we always have
productivity as a part of the planning process, but as Jason is saying, when you have inflation like we do, you
have to be able to ramp up those activities in order to get greater efficiencies.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. Sure. And everybody's dealing with inflation and it's certainly troubling and it's weighing on the results,
without question. And that was a lot of color. And I appreciate that color, Jason and Mike. I would encourage you,
please, to provide some actual metrics, though, to the investment community so that we can measure your
progress, understand what your goals are, and actually have some visibility in order to think about where you're
going and what you're trying to do, not just from a conceptual perspective, but from a numbers perspective,
because I think that would really help in improving the confidence.
One follow-up question would be on wholesale funding. I just took a look at – wholesale funding was up again this
quarter. Should we think about it getting back to the 2019 levels where it was like mid-6% of the funding side of
the balance sheet. Is that reasonable because it still looks like there's a little ways to go to get there? Or is this the
upper end of the range and are you trying to limit that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
There's not – there's nothing strategic that we've been doing in that area to bring it down. And so it is instructive
as you're doing to look back at more historical levels. It's not to say that's the target, but it is to say that where we
are right now is not – it's not reflective of any strategy that we have for lower levels.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe pivot a little bit, I was hoping to spend a couple minutes
on the Wealth Management and the Global Family Office trends. You guys highlighted outflows, client outflows,
asset outflows, I think, in both of those for the quarter. Wealth Management tends to kind of ebb and flow. But
Global Family Office historically, I think, has been a source of stronger organic growth. So maybe help us unpack
what's driving the outflows in both of these businesses and maybe also hit on the strategic price reductions that
you mentioned. How much of that is fully captured in the Q4 results? Is there any kind of negative carryover effect
into Q1 as we think about fees? And again, maybe a little bit more color on the reasons behind these pricing
reductions and what you ultimately expect to achieve there.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, let's just walk the fees because that's probably would – it's kind of how you're framing the question. And
fees down roughly $20 million for the quarter. Right at half of that is markets, and then a quarter of it is the
repricing that we mentioned earlier. And as this group knows extraordinarily well, in the asset management side of
the business, fee compression is still persistent. And so we've not done those types of reductions a lot recently.
We want to make sure that we're priced appropriately. And so with some of the index products, we took fee
reductions. That's only on the product side, not on the advisory side, and those were done. There's a step-down
there, no incremental benefit going forward and, at this point, no plans to do more.
The other quarter of the decline was outflows and that was – but that was product-related outflows, so really client
repositioning in the money market space, in the liquidity space. And we've seen a journey there for our clients
across both Wealth as well as Asset Servicing. It's very closely aligned to what we saw in deposits of large
decline as we came into COVID and decline as markets gained more confidence and then started to redeploy
assets into risk assets.
And so if we think about – the way we litmus test the business and wealth is to think about our advisory fee,
frankly, not the product side, but what are the assets and what are the fees related to the advice we have with
clients. And that's gone well. In the quarter, client flows for Wealth Management from an advisory perspective,
overall, we're positive. On a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, the net new business and flow activity that
we track was positive – low-single digits but it was positive.
So the business is not in decline. What we're seeing is a lot of clients deploying away from their historical mix of
using our money market funds, and then in this quarter, repricing of product.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. As you think about pricing broadly for the products, not the advisory component, but if you think about the
money market offering, given the fact that money market funds actually given a pretty healthy yield, is there any
thought around reducing your money market fees as well to become more competitive to maybe capture either
more of those flows or prevent folks from leaving and seeking a better kind of yield options net of fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
We look at it all the time, and it actually – it comes – it's more – that comes more into play on the institutional side.
And we've got a really – we've got a very large and successful money market mutual fund business. We do a lot
of liquidity work for our clients. And so, even now, there are some strategic waivers that we have in the
institutional side of the business where we're working pricing to ensure that we're as attractive as we can be. But
it's not just pricing that clients look at. On the institutional side, in particular, they look at size and they look at the
underlying quality of the assets.
And so a lot of the ultra-large investors have investment policy restrictions on how big they can be within a fund.
And so, the fact that we've got funds that are $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion, it enables those large investors to
put money to work. And so, the competition set is a little bit lower on the institutional side and we're above that
threshold. So in the long run, that's very good for us. There'll be ebbs and flows based on other factors. In the
long run, it's good.
14

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
On the Wealth side, that's just going to ebb and flow with the business. Traditionally, it's been more aligned. This
is just a period of time where our clients are – they're also thinking about deploying to building their own treasury
portfolios and laddering in portfolios there and then potentially other product. They'll use ultra-short. And so, we
do have high confidence that the mix of the usage of this product is going to come back to where it was
historically. And you're exactly right, it's a very attractive engagement for us economically.

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Jason, sorry to come back to NII, but I was just wondering, can you kind of put that all
into context for us in terms of if the balance sheet shrinking, you get a little bit of help from the repositioning. Just
can NII grow from here or based on what you still expect on the rate curve? And, I guess, that would be the
question. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, I appreciate you pushing on that. The answer is yes. It can absolutely grow from here, and
we anticipate that throughout the year it will. And I don't think first quarter is going to see – I'm not sure it's going
to see meaningful growth, but the trajectories are still in our favor. I mean, the balance sheet repositioning in and
of itself is – that's an attractive lift, and then betas are not 100%.
And so with the Fed actions, we're going to do well. And then we've also got the runoff, which helps us, too. And
so that – the only offset to that is volumes. And that's what – we're not sure what that's going to look like. But even
that remained relatively flat, why was it – it was at the top end, maybe a tiny bit above of what our anticipation was
last quarter. So, if I look out through the year, absolutely anticipation for NII to be – to be growing from this $550
million level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up to that is, how do you think about incremental betas from here in terms of
deposit cost increases? You had said you'd expected a decent move up this quarter, you did get that. So how do
we just understand that, that mix of deposits and the beta that you're looking at? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, yeah. I mean, the mix, I don't – we haven't seen that changing dramatically. But you're raising an interesting
point, which is that the betas are actually different depending on the currency that you're talking about. And so, I
15


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
just think that's something that's important for people to think about. And then most of the way the industry also
calculates beta is on just the interest-bearing portion. I think it's instructive to think about the total beta as well
because as we've talked about, the mix of interest-bearing to noninterest bearing changes over time and so that
has an effect as well. But, betas on the institutional side, I think you got to call them close to 100% at this point. It
varies by currency, but I think you got to call it close to 100%.
And then on the Wealth Management side, it's less than that. It's – and you can imagine for us to get to a blended
level that I'm talking about in kind of that 70% to 80% range, wealth is closer to 50% and the institutional side
closer to 100%.

Jason J. Tyler A

Morning, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, folks. Good morning, Jason. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to also ask about NII, just
– but actually more to focus on that deposit growth trend. And you talked about $110 billion to $115 billion in 1Q.
As you come into second quarter, maybe it's hard to assess this early, but what type of headwind would tax
payments be on that? And then sort of a related question would be, to what extent do you want to – or do you
think you need to defend the strategic wealth deposits and raise the beta further as we get into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. We're looking – I'll go in reverse order. I mean, we've talked about heavy defensive wealth deposits. The
economics are important. And that's – those are the things we want to be doing with our clients. Hard stop. And
so we're going to do everything we can to defend those. And they're largely relationship driven, but there's also –
there are pockets where our clients look really aggressively at rate. And so we've got good governance and
infrastructure to make sure we're doing what we can to maximize that.
And then throughout the year, you're just asking what are we – how are we thinking about it over the course of the
year? We've tended – you can go back and look historically at first quarter to second quarter and see what kind of
decline there has been. We don't think – we don't anticipate anything different this year. And then what I can tell
you is that from there, we don't expect – we have more of a flattish outlook. But we've got to just remember that
that second quarter decline does take place and history should be a pretty good judge.

Good morning, Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the pension accounting. Did that get triggered again this year, and
should we expect more charges this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Every year we come into and we don't expect there to be – to trigger settlement accounting. And it's ironic
because in 2021 we had the thresholds, but then we did a larger RIF and those ended up triggering. And then this
past year it was interest rates going up significantly that led to a higher level of retirements than we anticipated.
And so in no year do we anticipate it at this time. But we're in the exact – the bad news is we're in the exact same
boat this time, which is that we look at the thresholds with our outside actuaries, with our consultants, but we can't
predict with high degrees of certainty what the experience will be from a retirement perspective. And so we have
to let that play through.
That said, what we've experienced in 2021 and 2022, we had not experienced prior to that. And so it's not like this
is something that – it's happened the last two years. But if you look over the last 10 years, it hasn't happened and
– outside of these last two years. And so that's how we think and it seems like more of a trend than what – than –
certainly than what we're planning or anticipating.

Okay. And maybe just on capital, you had nice sequential improvement in capital ratios. Is there any
[indiscernible] (00:51:04) you didn't really do much in the way of buybacks in 2022? Do you see that being a
bigger part of the EPS story this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes, at some point. And so if you about the framework we've used historically and I've talked about it a lot, there's
no red flags there. And we don't have to have all of those components of the framework, saying green, if we look
at it in combination at any given point in time, and that we're at 10.8% right now. We also still have $1.6 billion in
AOCI. That'll come down a little bit actually in a chunk because of the securities repositioning because we did that
after the quarter. And so we've got, call it, $1.4 billion that's going to be accreting into capital over time. The
returns in the business are still strong. And so it's – there's no reason we wouldn't be back at some point.

Morning, guys. On the fee side, I just wanted to check in on organic growth and the competitive landscape this
quarter and into 2023 for both the institutional and the wealth businesses. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, different – I'd say different stories there. And on – if we start with the – we talked about Wealth a little bit
earlier. And if we think about just the core underlying business really focusing more on the account management
side, then the business had a very strong first half of the year and the second half of the year was weaker. And
we've also noted GFO was much stronger than the regions. But again, that's going to ebb and flow over time. But
organic growth, the way we have calculated and communicated it historically was negative in the regions for the
quarter and, call it, flat for GFO.
18


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
If you – actually slightly positive for GFO if you think about it on a year-over-year basis. So, it at least gives you a
sense of where that business is. And then on the – but then again from the advisory side there – even at the – for
the year-over-year and at the end of the quarter, the advisory fees did well.
And so the core business, they're strong. Just we think it's the product mix and other factors leading to the way
we've calculated organic growth is being negative. In Asset Servicing, different story. We talked at the early part
of the year that we felt pipeline was good. That pipeline started to onboard in fourth quarter and we feel good
about the growth in that business. And the proxy there should be more custody and fund servicing fees. Just as I
talked about account management fees in Wealth Management, the proxy for the – the same corollary there is
custody and fund servicing and that was a positive in fourth quarter was actually really attractive. We had new
business that Mike talked about early coming online in the business to the tune of kind of mid-single digits.
And we feel like that business is back to its historical organic growth rate and that's evidenced by what we
onboarded. The [ph] one knot (00:54:38) onboarded business we have right now is higher than our three-year
average. And the pipeline of business they have that they're still bidding on in late stages is higher than the three-
year average for the business. And so a lot of positive signs in the Asset Servicing business from an organic
perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
That's helpful. Just on that, starting to onboard business in Asset Servicing, I think in the past you had talked
about that not really coming online until the second half of 2023. So, is that a pull forward there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

Actually, there's – go ahead [indiscernible] (00:55:18).

2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Actually, that was – it was early 2022 that we talked about there being business in the back half of the year,
those onboarding, so that did come into place. We do have right now – there's a chunk of business that we know
is onboarding. In the short run, the pipeline's good and then you go out far there to the end of 2023 and there's
another chunk of large business that we're anticipating to come on in a couple different areas, fourth quarter and
even into first quarter of 2024. And so the pipeline for that business is – at various stages, is looking good.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. On the expenses, it's – oh, my – I get it. Look, you guys are dealing with the first decline in both stock and
bond markets in over 50 years. You said you're preserving growth by investing in people and tech. There's
inflation. But wow, this is the worst quarterly operating leverage that I can recall for you guys. And for the year, it
was negative operating leverage of 500 basis points and even comp has grown twice the pace of revenue growth.
So, I guess what I'm looking for is more assurance that expenses haven't gotten away from you. I get it, at the
high level, you said, it looks like you're rightsizing head count with severance. You took out hundreds of tech-
related contracts. You have some kind of mainframe strategy. I have to tell you, I just don't understand what that
means from a bottom line standpoint.
So, I guess, the question is you said your expenses to trust fee ratio of 120% is unacceptable. But what is
acceptable and when should you get there, like 2024 or 2025? What kind of sense of urgency do you have?
Because this is not the Northern we've gotten to know over the past long while, aside from your resiliency through
tough times. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Mike, it's Mike. To your point, if you go back a number of years where we were at levels that are like this, it's
been a long time. And that's why it is considered unacceptable where we are. And we were effective in driving
that ratio down into an area where, yes, we thought it was within that range for us to be able to continue to
operate. And that's kind of that 105% to 110% range. And we have the same objective now of getting it back into
that into that range.
That calculation is a numerator and a denominator and we're trying to drive both of those, right? So beyond the
challenging environment on the fee front, which is going to happen at various times, we're trying to drive the
organic growth there. And as much as we had – good growth in the year, it was not one of our stronger organic
growth levels. So, challenged on the numerator both, I would say, conditions but also what we did on our part.
And then on the other side, I – from an expense perspective, I – as Jason said, like, we got a lot done not just this
year but the last couple of years and really making, I'll call it, the company more resilient. And I'll get into a little
more detail on that. But just contextually, if you think back a few years, with the pandemic and then the last couple
of years, the technology infrastructure of the company is just critical to your ability to be just what you said, which
is resilient and therefore, your clients in any set of conditions. And so, that's required a lot of investments in
technology. Some of it, if you think about it you have to be able to operate completely remotely and so you have
to invest to be able to do that. And you also have to be reliable for clients. And so when it comes to modernizing
all the technology you have, it does require investment on that front.

And in the meantime, we also push forward with our digitalization efforts, which is much more the client-facing
part of that, which is essential to being competitive and essential to growing. So, it's been very active across that.
Some of that is, I'll call it, nondiscretionary. Right? It needs to be done to be able to do what I said.
Other parts of it, you do have more discretion in the speed, particularly around the digitalization front and you're
looking at the returns that you're going to get for that. So, we've talked about things like Matrix which has been a
meaningful investment which will drive both productivity but also will drive our capabilities, and therefore, revenue
and organic growth on that front.
The same thing is happening in Wealth Management where we have to make sure that our interface with our
clients is frictionless, as Steve would say, in the technology interface with the clients. That part of it, again, we can
pay some and that's part of what we'll have to do on the technology front.
And the last part of it is, just the need for efficiencies around the technology spend. And then just more broadly,
which we've done many times and need to just increase the focus on execution around those, what I'll call, more
traditional ways to drive productivity. So you asked the question on, okay, when does it get into that range? Is it
2023? Is it 2024? I don't know because I don't know exactly what's going to happen with the numerator and the
denominator. But that's what we're driving towards is to get it into that range. And in the meantime also trying to
drive profitability, meaning driving pre-tax margins above 30%. So, that's kind of the view and the plan.

Can you give any specifics for the year? I know it's not always your style, but in terms of kind of expense growth
for the year or what the savings are from the elimination of all the tech contracts or even just if I think of investing
along a J curve, it seems like, you're on this tech journey like a lot of others are and some are still in the investing
phase and some are in the harvesting phase. When do you think you go from investing to harvesting on this
broader tech strategy, which seems to be impacting your expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So I'll answer both but then let Jason add, too. But we're clearly in the investing stage, but I would say –
and you're always investing, of course in that because the needs change over time, et cetera. But from a cresting
perspective, et cetera, we're more towards that than we are away from it, if that makes sense and now that we
have gotten a lot done in the last couple of years on that front. So that's my view.
And then as far as the expenses, we've talked about for the year expenses at 9%. So that's the part where we're
saying, that doesn't work and so how do we bring that down. Now, there's still going to be growth in expenses for
the year because there are certain aspects that just carry into the year, right? So, you do have base pay
increases that flow in and you do have some of the technology costs that are amortization that just come into the
year. But outside of that, you're trying to do everything you can with productivity to offset other increases.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Well, I can give you a little bit more color on the year, if it's helpful and whatever information is helpful obviously
I'm happy to give what we see at this point. But one thing as you're thinking about the next several quarters, not
just the next one is outside services was elevated and lots of things happening there in fourth quarter. Some of
that's episodic, some of that is – has – I'm sorry, other expense. Some of that's episodic – agency expense,
supplemental pension plan. Some of those have more of a longer term trend. So think travel, marketing that was
actually up $8 million over third quarter. That's likely going to stay elevated. But some of these are episodic. And
so, we don't think we're going to see other expenses at a $107 million. It should even – that should quickly unless
– and some of it's out of our control because things like the supplemental pension plan are market affected, but
that should get to below $100 million and hopefully stay that way going forward.
And then you just think about the impact also of compensation. Just to give you some color there. We know base
pay is going to come online in second quarter. That's going to be a $20 million lift. And then to severance activity,
we think that should – that's going to help us – help offset that a little bit, probably $5 million to $7 million on a
quarterly basis starting in the second, third quarter. And then we'll have some additional hiring but that's going to
be in line with the growth of the business.
So, that at least gives you a sense of some of the line items. And then last – visibility on equipment and software
and the depreciation that we got coming into first quarter. That levels out a lot. There's some growth, call it, a
couple million dollars a quarter after that, but nowhere near this level. And so, a lot of that – that's where you get
to what's the impact of those hundreds of contracts coming out?
We're starting to flatten that depreciation and amortization line which sits within equipment and software, which
has been the fastest grower. It just reflected that we've gotten a lot of work done.

Hi, Jason. Coming back to the expense topic in conversation. On the salaries, can you share with us the cost of
those salaries? Is it going more to entry-level folks, or is it more your senior people? And then second, are you at
risk of losing people which is why you had to bump up salaries? And then maybe a little more details about just
the salary portion.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, two very different dynamics happening. The actions we're taking this year are not across the board
much more targeted than they have been historically and very centered around – frankly, around technology and
some operations-oriented functions effectively. And so that just gives you a sense of where we're going.
And then to why we've had some of the increases, some of the salary increase we had last year, obviously, was
an inflation-related higher-than-average merit increase. But a lot of the growth we had last year was doing off-
cycle adjustments to retain talent specifically in the Wealth Management business. And we think that that's largely
done at this point. We can never claim that that's – with certainty that that's fully over, but that was meaningful.
And we wanted – you know how important that franchise is to us, and how important that talent base is. And so,
we were going to defend that base. And with that episode, that seems to be over at this point. And we're more to
a business-as-usual growth rate across the organization, but we're identifying areas where we can get significant
salary run rate savings and getting after those aggressively.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, can you share with us on the sale of the fixed income portfolio, which
resulted in the losses that you reported? Can you give us some color on what types of securities were sold and
the yields of those securities? And then by reinvesting the proceeds from that sale, how long will it take you to
earn back that loss that you had to take to exit the portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So what we looked for was – were securities that have – that had a combination of a couple things. One,
poor RWA treatment and secondly, lower coupon, lower yield. And third, that they still had significant time to
maturity. And so that bucket ended up being $2 billion, $2.5 billion. The coupon on those was in the 2% to 2.25%
on average. And the reinvestment of those coming in at – think about in earnings on reserve balances at the Fed
in the 4.5% range at this point.
And in terms of the payback on that, it's more like a three-and-a-half years. But remember, from a regulatory
reporting perspective, we had already stripped out the unrealized loss in that portfolio. And so the drivers of this
were very largely around the opportunity to improve capital ratios. Not that we needed to improve capital or
liquidity, we didn't, but seeing the opportunity to benefit CET1 in the form of lower RWA treatment help improve
liquidity ratio and at the same time not hurt the economic value of your earnings stream. It was very attractive to
go after. And that's really what led us to do this.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, Gerard actually asked my question. But I did want to clarify one item relating to the
securities portfolio repositioning, which is whether you have any appetite to actually engage in further
repositioning of the book from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, we would have appetite, frankly, because it's an attractive thing to do. But at the same time, we feel like
we've harvested just about everything that's there. And I'm glad you asked the follow-up because as soon as I
finished, I realized Gerard and now you might be interested in there's a little bit more color. Corporate bonds
within the $2 billion was about half, munis and mortgage-backed securities were about a quarter each, just so you
know. But it's an attractive time to go after something like that given the yield curve and the ability to change non-
HQLA assets to HQLA assets, pick-up capital, pick-up liquidity and no impact from an economic perspective and
in fact making it positive.

Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Hey, good morning. I just want to follow up on one of the capital and share purchase question from earlier.
I guess – I look at your capital ratios are well above your minimums, which is consistent with how you – you've
always manage the capital. But you've got a number of tailwinds on that front. And Jason, you mentioned that you
plan to resume the buybacks at some point, but I guess it seems to me that there's really no time like the present.
So my question is, should we expect the share repurchases to engage in a more meaningful way in the first
quarter? And when we think about the full year, what are the guardrails we should consider for your capital ratios
as we think about modeling capital return from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, we won't comment more on timing. And if I get to the guardrails, it's instructive, I think, to look – and
again, none of these are 100% determinative, they're just part of how we think about it. But these are the factors
we think about. Look at the absolute levels, which tells you to look at history, look at where we are relative to
peers and then relative to regulatory perspectives. We look at those things.
And then the other dynamic is that RWA has been less predictable than pre-COVID. And we used our balance
sheet to be there for our clients. And we were one of the few institutions that actually let RWA increase over the
last several years. And it's because we wanted – our clients had loan demand and they wanted us to be there in
FX activity and sec lending. And we did that because we had – it was because we were able to because we had
the capital strength and flexibility to do that.
And so that's the thing that we're also looking forward on to make sure that we're not missing any significant
changes in client demand that we – that might impact our behavior. But you're right in that sitting at 10.8% is a
much better position. And then back to this concept of $1.4 billion in AOCI pulling to par over the next several
years plus the return on equity in the business is still attractive. And so we're still each quarter accreting capital,
and so no reason we – we won't be in the market at some point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
If I could just follow up on that, Jason. So the loan balances were down about 2.5% sequentially. It sounds like – I
guess how are you thinking about that loan demand from here? Our view is – it sounded like it was kind of softer
going forward, but you kind of alluded to the fact that maybe you want to be there to meet client demand. So are
you expecting that loan demand to pick up here in 2023?
And then I guess just one other follow-on on the capital side. How do you think about inorganic actions here in
terms of capital allocation? Like, do you see any other opportunities to change your strategic asset mix and scale
so that perhaps that could be another avenue that you would consider on the capital allocation front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, on loan demand, I always remind people, super spiky. And on the base of business we have and the
clients that we have, that can come with really significant asks and we're happy to do it because a lot of times
they've got potentially billions of dollars in assets and then they might have a liquidity need and they don't want to
liquidate the asset. It's a great opportunity for us to help them at very large dollar amounts. It solidifies
relationships well.
And so, we just don't look quarter-to-quarter at loan volumes as much as I think it's appropriate to for other
institutions. In general, our growth expectations are for more of a business-as-usual growth rate. We do anticipate
some growth this year in the business, not a ton, but more business-as-usual.
And then on capital, there's no problem we're trying to fix and mix or scale. And, frankly, in capability, we're just
thinking opportunistically, if things come up, we've got the capital to be able to look at it. We have talked about
having more of a bias at this point toward Wealth Management. We've done some things from an acquisition
perspective in Asset Servicing over the last several years. They've gone well, but we've got a whole product circle
there that we feel good about. We're doing well. But the more we can bring on attractive wealth clients that don't

necessarily have the holistic product approach that we can bring, it's a great opportunity for us to create value.
And so, that would be – that'd be top of the list. But no problems we're looking to solve from a mix or sale or scale
perspective.

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Switch gears a little bit, just on the Wealth side, to what extent are
you seeing any impact from some of your entrepreneur clients that they may have had lower valuations in their
private businesses or in their public businesses? Are you seeing any kind of pullback from those clients? Is it
significant or is it really just not that big a deal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Brian, it's Mike. I would say we definitely are seeing a different perspective on the part of the clients that
you're talking about or prospects, right? I mean, a lot of the activity in 2021, beginning of 2022, was as a result of
business owners who were selling their businesses, were monetizing assets. And so that was an uplift for us. And
with the reduced activity that you're seeing of IPOs and market activity there, but then also certainly in the private
marketplace, lower activity there definitely has had an impact for us of just less market opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And then just I had one more on expenses. A lot's been asked and answered. But just in
terms of the onboarding for the Asset Servicing pipeline, should we expect what is typically in the business where
you have some onboarding expenses ahead of when the contracts are installed and generating revenue? Is that
something also that might create some noise for 2023 given the 4Q larger, chunky mandate that I think you're
bringing on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. A couple things. One, nothing that we'd call out at this point. If that changes, we'd call it out for you. And in
some instances, even some of those expenses are capitalized in long-term contracts. But nothing at this point that
we want you to be thinking ahead on.
