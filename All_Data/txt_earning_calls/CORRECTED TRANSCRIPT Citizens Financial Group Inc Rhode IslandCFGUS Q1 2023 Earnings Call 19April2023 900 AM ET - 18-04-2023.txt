Hey. Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. First quarter brought many
unexpected challenges in the environment. Nonetheless, we proved resilient and adaptable and we delivered a
solid quarter for our stakeholders. We maintained a strong capital, liquidity and funding position with our CET1
ratio at 10%, our TCE ratio at 6.6%, and a solid deposit franchise that skews two-thirds Consumer. We've seen
the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the
month of March.
For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.10 and return on tangible equity of 15.8%. Our NII
was down 3%, reflecting day count impact, slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of 3.3%.
Non-interest income and non-interest expense came in broadly as expected, both impacted by seasonality. Our
credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our ACL to loans ratio to 1.47%, which was up 4 basis
points during the quarter and 17 basis points higher than our pro forma day one CECL ACL ratio. We
repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter, which reduced our share count by 1.7%.
In our slide deck, we tackle head on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about. I'll let
John run through the details, but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital, liquidity and
funding position. We have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group, in
focusing on a stable, consumer-oriented and granular deposit base, and in establishing a prudent credit risk
appetite and reserve level. While we have some commercial real estate exposure, we feel good about our
diversification, the asset characteristics, and the borrower quality. CRE criticized assets and workouts will
increase during the cycle, but we currently expect losses to be manageable and we've already set aside
meaningful reserves.
On the regulatory front, it is clear that some changes will occur. Our hope is that the response is thoughtful and
appropriate, leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before.
In any case, we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process, with any revisions likely to be
phased in gradually.
While much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense, we continue to play prudent offense
by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives. We will clearly prioritize deposits deepening and efficiency
initiatives for the balance of 2023. Our New York City Metro integration is progressing extremely well, with the
successful core conversion of Investors Bank in February and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan.
Our outlook for 2023 still shows attractive ROTCE for the full year despite the challenging environment. There is
still a great deal of uncertainty which makes forecasting more difficult, but we remain confident in the strength of
our franchise and the ability to weather the storm. We are building a great bank and we remain excited about our
future. Our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of
opportunities as they arise.
With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing
slide 5. Big picture, first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment. We
continued to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives, including the well-executed conversion of the
investor platform in February.
For the first quarter, we generated underlying net income of $560 million and EPS of $1.10. Our underlying
ROTCE for the quarter was 15.8%. Net interest income was down 3% linked quarter given the lower day count
and lower interest earning assets. Our margin was stable at 3.3%. Period end loans and average loans were
down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, such as our
ongoing runoff of auto.
Deposits also declined in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors, the compounding impact of
the rate environment, and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter. Importantly, our deposit levels were
broadly stable during the market turbulence in March. Our quarter end LDR is 89.8% and our liquidity position
remains very strong, with current available liquidity as of today of about $66 billion. Our credit metrics and overall
position remains solid. Total net charge-offs of 34 basis points are up 12 basis points linked quarter, in line with
ongoing normalization trends.
We've recorded a provision for credit losses of $168 million and a reserve build of $35 million this quarter,
increasing our ACL coverage to 1.47%, up from 1.43% at the end of the fourth quarter, with most of the increase
directed to the general office portfolio. Our current coverage ratio is about 17 basis points stronger than our pro
forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3%.
We repurchased $400 million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio at the top of
our target range at 10%. And our tangible book value per share is up 6% linked quarter.
Before I walk through the detail of results for the quarter, let me address some of the industry issues that are top
of mind on slide 6. First, we have a very strong capital base, which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer
group, even if one were to include the rate-driven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities. We have a
quality deposit franchise, which has performed very well since the turbulence which began in early March.
We continue to see the benefit from all of the investments we've made since the IPO, with 67% of total deposits
from Consumer and a well-diversified Commercial portfolio, with about 66% of our clients using us as their
primary bank.
Finally, 68% of deposits are insured or secured. Our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base,
ample available liquidity and strong risk management capabilities. In fact, our LCR level exceeds what would be
required as a Category III bank at March 31, 2023.
Looking at credit, our metrics continue to look solid. Retail is normalizing, but is still performing quite well as the
employment picture remains strong. On the commercial side, our focus is on the CRE portfolio and on general
office in particular, which is impacted by back to work trends and rising interest rates. We have a very strong
reserve coverage of 6.7% on the general office portfolio, and I'll go through some of the details later.
And lastly, the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in March, which, in
our view, was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader gaps in regulation or management

lapses. We'll watch closely how things develop, but, in any case, we think the process will be thoughtful and
deliberate. Finally, we believe we are well-positioned for any increase in regulatory requirements, given our
diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios.
Let's drill into the details on the next few slides, starting with capital on slide 7. We ended the quarter with one of
the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group, with a CET1 ratio at the top of our target range of 10%.
This strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved
returns over the medium term.
If you include the rate-driven unrealized loss on debt securities in AOCI, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.7%.
If you remove the unrealized loss in HTM, our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by 20 basis points to
6.4%. All of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group, again, in this quarter.
We expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward, with the ability to generate roughly 25 basis points
of capital, post dividend, each quarter and before share buybacks. We have $1.6 billion of repurchase capacity
remaining under our current board authorization. Timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external
conditions.
Next, I'll move to slide 8 to discuss our deposit franchise. As you can see, our deposit franchise is skewed
towards Consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap.
About 67% of our total deposits are Consumer, up from 60% at December 31, which puts us in the top quartile of
our peer group. And roughly 68% of our deposits are insured by the FDIC, or secured, which is up from 60% at
year-end. Demand deposits represent about 26% of the book, down slightly from 27% at year-end, as customers
have naturally rotated towards higher yielding alternatives.
On slide 9, the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear 2022, following the Investors' acquisition
and the commencement of QT has been in line with industry performance. We outgrew both the industry and peer
average in the second half of 2022. We entered 2023 expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the
first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment. And we saw a little more of that
than we had forecast by about 1%, but most of that happened in January and February.
Given our rundown in auto, we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter, trying to hold the line
on betas. In March, we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry look to diversify
their deposits in the wake of bank failures. But overall, our deposits were broadly stable during the month. This
strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the IPO. And
this will remain a focus as we continue to build a top-performing bank franchise.
On slide 10, we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our
customers. In Consumer, we've developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer
satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us. We have strong analytics capabilities and compelling
offerings such as CitizensPlus in our private client group, as well as Citizens Access, our digital bank, to leverage.
And with the final conversion complete at Investors, we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the
New York Metro market.
On the Commercial side, we have invested heavily in our Treasury Solutions capabilities with a state-of-the-art
platform and strong talent to serve client needs. We continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their
cash and drive higher operational deposits, as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits.

Moving to slide 11. We are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely, given the softening macro
environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs. The general office sector is of particular
concern as tenants rethink their space needs, given the remote work trends. Given these pressures, we are
evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular CRE office. It's worth noting,
however, that near 100% of our borrowers are current on their obligations with NPLs under 50 basis points. We
are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and added work-out resources. But given the diversity and
quality of the portfolio, we feel the credit costs will be manageable. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 2%
includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of 6.7%.
On slide 12, we drill down a bit on the $6.3-billion office portfolio, which includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and
life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform
quite well. The remaining $4.1 billion relates to the general office segment, which we feel is reasonably well
positioned across type, geography, and suburban areas and central business districts. About 90% of the general
office portfolio was income producing, and about 70% is located in suburban areas and the majority is Class A.
Next, I'll provide further details related to first quarter results. On slide 13, net interest income was down 3% given
the lower day count, which was worth about $29 million, and slightly lower interest earning assets. The net
interest margin of 3.3% was stable, with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs. With Fed
funds increasing 475 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta has been
well controlled at 33% through the end of the quarter. We continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position, so
that we have downright protection in the second half of 2023 and through 2026. As we approach the height of the
rate cycle, we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly 3% at the end of last year to a more neutral
1.1% at the end of the first quarter.
Moving on to slide 14, we posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and
higher rates. Fees showed some resilience amid a challenging environment, down 4% linked quarter, with
seasonal impact in capital markets and service charges, partly offset by strength in FX and derivatives revenue
and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees.
Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter, and syndications and M&A advisory
fees were seasonally lower. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines and signs that deal flow
should pick up as the year progresses. Mortgage fees are slightly better with higher production fees as we are
seeing our volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity. This should continue to
benefit margins over time. And finally, card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter.
On slide 15, expenses came in better than expected, up only 2.8% linked quarter given seasonally higher salaries
and employee benefits, as well as the impact of an industry-wide FDIC surcharge implemented at the beginning
of the year.
On slide 16, average loans were down slightly and period-end loans down 1% linked quarter, including the impact
of planned auto runoff. We have seen commercial utilization decrease a bit over the quarter as inflation and
supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower
CapEx in anticipation of reduced economic activity. Average retail loans are down slightly, reflecting the planned
runoff in auto, which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity.
On slide 17, average deposits were down $4.7 billion or 2.6% linked quarter, driven by seasonal and rate related
outflows. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in January and February, with

balances broadly stable in March. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 51 basis points, which translates to
a 73% sequential data and a 36% cumulative data
Moving on to slide 18, we saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios.
Net charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 12 basis points linked quarter, which reflects continued normalization.
Nonperforming loans are 64 basis points of total loans, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in
commercial was offset by improvements in retail. Retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter
and continue to remain favorable to historical levels. But we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to
gauge how the consumer is faring.
Turning to slide 19, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $35
million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the
commercial portfolio, particularly general office. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.4%, which is a 4-basis
point increase from the fourth quarter. The current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession
and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as
CRE.
Moving to slide 20, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at
the top end of our target range. Tangible book value per share was up 6% in the quarter and the tangible common
equity ratio has improved to 6.6%. We returned a total of $605 million to shareholders through share repurchases
and dividends.
Shifting gears a bit on slide 21, we continue to make good progress with our push into the New York Metro
market. We were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at Investors in February, which
went very smoothly. With that behind us, we are full steam ahead, working to serve our customers and capitalize
on opportunities to capture market share.
We continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches, where customer
satisfaction has been improving significantly, and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition
sales rates in our network across the legacy HSBC and Investors branches. We've also seen some good early
client wins and a growing pipeline in Commercial. We look forward to making further strides as we leverage the
full power of our product line-up and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York
market.
Moving to slide 22 for a quick update on our TOP 8 program. Our latest TOP program is well underway and
progressing well. Given the external environment, we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our TOP 8
program in order to protect returns, as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in
our business to drive future performance. We'll have more to say about this in the coming months.
Moving to slide 23, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for
the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown, with the Fed expected to raise rates by 25
basis points in May and then begin easing late in the year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to decrease
about 3%. Noninterest income is up mid to high-single digits. Noninterest expense should be stable to down
slightly. Net charge-offs should remain in the mid-30s basis points. Our CET1 is expected to come in above 10%,
with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment.
Moving to slide 24. As we think about the full year, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and
funding position while sustaining attractive returns. Of course, there is a continued level of uncertainty in the
7

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
current environment. For the full year 2023, we expect NII to be up 5% to 7%. We are focused on initiatives that
will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year.
Noninterest income is expected to be up mid-single digits. Noninterest expense is expected to be up about 5%.
Net charge-offs are expected to be in the mid to high 30s basis points. Our current reserve level contemplates a
moderate recession and known risks, and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given
anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down. And our CET1 ratio is expected to be above the
upper end of our 9.5% to 10% target range at 10% to 10.25%. Assuming stable market conditions, our share
repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year.
To sum up on slide 25, we delivered a solid quarter despite unexpected challenges and are ready for the
uncertainty that lies ahead in 2023. Our strong capital, liquidity and funding position will serve us well to move
forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong
defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future. Even
as we navigate through the current challenging environment, we reaffirm our commitment to our medium-term
financial targets.
With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.

As we contemplate your original net interest income guide of 11% to 14%, now up 5% to 7%, could you walk us
through what the major changes are in assumptions? And how much of it was cyclical, such as the deposit runoff,
higher beta and how much of it could be a little bit more structural as you anticipate different rules, such as
carrying higher liquidity funded by wholesale funding?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Yeah. Let me start and I'll quickly flip it to John. But I would say, Erika, that really we're just recognizing what
we've seen in the deposit markets, and the cost of deposits is going up. I think that was partly a response to kind
of the Fed rapid rises and money funds becoming alternative. So there was, I think, a greater sensitivity around
earning a return on cash that kicked in. And then, that was, I think, further exacerbated by the bank failures in
March. And so, I think there was kind of heightened velocity of deposits moving around the system. And so, to
retain those deposits, folks had to increase rate paid.
We feel that we did a pretty good job here. We came into the year expecting that there'd be some seasonal
outflows in Q1. And since we had built deposits in the second half of the year and then we had auto running
down, so less volume on the asset side, we were prepared to let those run down by about 3.5% in the quarter.
We actually saw about 1% higher than that in the runoff. But in any case, we tried to hold the line on betas, and I
think the betas that we posted are slightly better than peers that have reported at this point.
But if you kind of play out the rest of the year, we're going to be paying more for our funding than we thought
coming into the year. And that's pretty much the big driver. I would say there might be kind of a little more
discipline in terms of who we are extending credit to, given I think probably a higher likelihood that we could see a
short and shallow recession.
So there might be a little volume impact there from slightly lower earning assets, and maybe there is a little mix
where we're holding a little precautionary cash. But if I had to kind of put it in order, I would say number one is the
cost of deposits, and maybe slightly the volume on assets, and then, thirdly, would be composition.
So John, I'll flip it to you
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Those are the right points to focus on. I'd say, you break it down, Erika, between rate and volume. On the
rate side, as you heard from Bruce, we have the migration from a deposit standpoint. You're going to see the full
year effect of that, of what's happened over the last quarter or two. And the drivers of that are well-documented.
We've got the cycle with higher rates and quantitative tightening going on. That's causing those forces to kind of
hit us. I would also say that beta did move up a bit more than maybe we had planned, given the outlook. So we
were, I think, in the high-30s prior, maybe we're in the low-40s through the through the cycle. So we're building
that in.
We also mentioned that from a liquidity standpoint, I think we feel very good about that from a – we are already
compliant. If we were a Category III bank, we're already compliant on the LCR. But from a volume standpoint, we
are in rundown in auto. We're looking at some balance sheet optimization initiatives in Commercial. And so, you'll
see the LDR fall throughout the rest of the year.
And then, finally, I would say that the other things I look at, on the positive side, I mean our loan betas, from a
cumulative standpoint, will still exceed cumulatively where we're coming out on deposits. So you'll see that mid to
upper-40s on loans versus the low-40s on deposits. You got front book, back book. When the Fed finally kind of
pauses and starts to starts to cut, you'll see a lot of the balance sheet continue to contribute over the quarters,
post maybe a possible pause and cut that the Fed may kind of engage in. So lots to...

You might add too, John, about the swaps that we continue to dynamically recalibrate the swaps to provide
protection for the event that the Fed, ultimately, moves lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think it's a really good point. I mean, when you think that's – what we were just talking about is the 2023
sort of story. I mean, when you get to the end of 2023, into 2024, this cycle compared to last cycle, we have a lot
more down-rate protection in place for the second half of 2023 and into 2024 than we might have had in prior
cycles. So if you notice, we're...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Which will help support a good guide for 2024.

Yeah, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I guess just to close this off, Erika, I would say, if you look at the outlook for the year, kind of the one thing
that got marked down was really NII. We still feel pretty good about the fee outlook. We're going to work a little
harder on expenses and probably bring that in below where we thought, coming into the year. I'd say, credit
provisioning should be about kind of where we thought, coming into the year. We're still angling to repurchase
shares over the course of the year.
So our expectation is that we can continue to deliver return on tangible equity in the kind of mid-teen area, and
just reflective that it won't make quite as much net interest income this year, but still investing in the things to
position us to have a good kind of runway into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. I'll let one of my peers ask more detail on the swap recalibration, because I think that's important as
we think about NII for 2024. But since we have you Bruce, I want to ask you about how you're thinking about
these anticipated regulatory changes for regional banks. I'm glad that you said in the prepared remarks that it
takes time, right? You have the NPR, which could come out end of the year or a year from now, a year of
comment period, then a phase in.
So as we think about what the market is anticipating, whether its TLAC or getting rid of opt out on AOCI, and of
course you said you're already LCR compliant. How are you thinking about managing your capital relative to your
stocks down [ph] at time (00:31:56), right? And it seems like banks can never buyback as much of the time when
they should be buying back. And the potential in 2024 for some non-banks to be in bigger trouble and potentially
taking market share, but balancing that with what's going to be potentially tighter requirements on capital and
liquidity. How much are you front-loading that versus thinking about the opportunities that can come your way if
you remain as profitable as you say you're going to remain?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Great question. And I guess just to set the big picture, Erika, that I would say, first off, I don't believe that
the answer to the two bank failures is more regulation on regional banks. I think those were idiosyncratic
situations and there was sufficient regulation. So you, basically, had business models that were not well
diversified and the banks grew too fast and stretched management capabilities. Supervisors didn't really do their
job. And so, I think there'll be a thoughtful review of what were the issues and then how to address them.
I think it's probable that there will be some tightening around liquidity and capital and probably closer reviews of
how banks are handling their asset liability management. There may be other aspects of this in terms of, the
overnight repo facility and creating a viable drain on bank deposits and the money funds and should they change
that, and deposit insurance and should they take a look at that. So, there's a bunch of things I think will come
under review.
Specifically with respect to us, I think the good news is that we've managed our capital at the high end of our peer
group, and so we're already compliant. We would be. If we ended up having the AOCI filter removed, we'd be in
compliance today. The same thing John pointed out, the LCR, we've run that at a high level. We run very rigorous
internal liquidity stress testing regiment that we'd already be in compliance with the Category III bank as well.
So the fact that we have managed the balance sheet conservatively, we're already in compliance if they go kind of
heavier regulation. If that ends up going down that path, I think we're in good position. So I think we will have and
the fact that these will be phased in over kind of, I'd say, two years or three years gives us lots of capital flexibility
to be buying back our stock or taking advantage of other situations where – that could arise. And if it's
strategically and financially compelling, I think we have the capability to go on offense.
So anyway, that's kind of my thoughts on that. It was good to kind of stay conservative even when we had lots of
questions as to why aren't you leveraging your capital structure more, why are you keeping your CET1 target so
high. Guess what? We keep it that way and we've run conservative for precisely these air pockets that you're
always going to experience turbulence, and high capital and high liquidity is your best friend in these
circumstances.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. I wanted to just follow up on Erika's question on the NII guide. I was wondering, could you be a
little bit more specific on the outlook for margin and loan trends going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and get started on that. So, the guide being up 5% to 7%, what we built into that, as we
mentioned, is the fact that we're going to have some downward kind of impact on margin coming from the deposit
11

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
migration, as well as increased beta assumptions that we're building in. So, there's a lot of uncertainty here and a
lot of things to play out. But to try to frame it a little bit, go out – if you think about where we may – in 4Q 2023
where we may in the year – we're starting the year at 3.30%, we may in the year call it in a wide range, maybe
3.10% to 3.20%. And if things kind of – if there's good execution and some trends maybe end up – going our way,
we'll end up at the high end of that range and vice versa on the lower end.
And then, so I'd say that when you think about playing it out throughout the year, there'll be a step down as you
work through the year with maybe a little bit of weighting into 2Q and things basically flattening out into the
second half of the year. But like I said, there's a lot of uncertainty there and – but that helps – hopefully that will
help give you a frame. And then you've got – as we mentioned, on the volume side of things, we do have the auto
rundown, which we began last year, that will be – is built into that guide, as well as the ongoing work that we're
doing in Commercial and balance sheet optimization. So – and you put all that together and that gives you the NII
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just add to that. Good answer, John. This is an opportunity. We've always been on balance sheet
optimization path, but I think we're really intensifying our focus there. So, businesses like indirect auto where it
was a good place to kind of park liquidity and we run the business well. We are servicing very well, but it's not
really that strategically important to us. It doesn't have direct customers that we cross-sell to because those
customers frankly are customers of the dealerships.
So, looking hard at those business and say, hey, if deposits are more dear, what do we have on the left side of
our balance sheet where we don't have deep relationships and we're not making the best risk adjusted returns.
And so during this year, I think we're going to really focus on making sure that the right side of the balance sheet
in terms of deposit quality is as strong as it possibly can be and that where we're lending money, we're doing that
to true customers that we have deep relationships, whether they're consumers, small business or commercial.
And so, we'll take the opportunity this year to potentially have a little bit of a reset and even intensify those efforts,
so we'll really love our balance sheet going into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And if I could just ask about deposits, the outlook. I recognize deposits stabilized in March and you've done
a lot of work to improve the deposit franchise. But it just seems like in this environment, to keep deposits stable, to
growing deposits from here could be a little bit of a challenge not only for you. And I was wondering if you could
just give us some color on some of the deposit opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Why don't I start at the top and then maybe I'll turn it to Brendan and Don to talk about what we're doing in
Consumer and Commercial. We did put a slide in there, Peter, about some of those opportunities. And so I think
that right now we just need to kind of get through this earnings season and see the cards turned over and
continue the trend, hopefully, of less and less turbulence and getting back to a more calm situation. So, that's
where kind of stability comes in.
And, by the way, through – halfway through April, we're still kind of trending stable to even slightly up. But then
the initiatives that we have long invested in and the value propositions that we have both for Consumer and some
12


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
of the new innovation we have on the Commercial side we think should start to play out and then we can start to
build back deposits. But why don't I first turn it to Brendan to talk about Consumer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks. So, the Consumer – in the Consumer business, you've got sort of kind of three segments of
deposits, the traditional retail, wealth management, and then small business. And it's kind of progressing as
expected, these have been in chatting mode over the last couple of quarters. We certainly have customers
coming into the cycle that have excess deposits and liquidity from pre-COVID. We're seeing very, very small earn
down rates, but nothing that is unexpected and broadly right in line with trends from mid-summer last year through
this quarter.
As John pointed out, through March, on all three of those portfolios, we saw 60% to 75% increase in inflows. But
the same sort of increase on outflow is broadly just moving money around. And so, we were very stable on net
balances across those businesses through the month of March. We feel really good about the underlying health.
Over the last eight years, we've invested a lot of time and energy in making our Consumer deposit base much
more granular. Our primacy rate, so whether customers consider us a primary bank or not, is up dramatically to
above peer levels. That's a good thing. That means stability in low cost deposits when payroll is coming in. We've
done things like added benefits like early pay for consumers, which is an encouragement to bring payroll and
direct deposit over, that's going quite well. It adds more granularity and stability of the deposit base.
And when I look at levers to continue to have strong deposit performance for the rest of the year, there's a couple
of things in the consumer bank that we're really, really focused on. One, John mentioned New York City, New
Jersey, household growth, getting more customers. That is going well. We're performing at the top end of our peer
set in terms of net market share gain and household growth. We expect that to continue in all of our markets and
supported by the really early momentum in New York City, in New Jersey that we expect to continue.
We've also made a pretty meaningful pivot into a customer relationship deepening. So, we've rolled out program,
as Bruce mentioned, CitizensPlus, which the simple concept is you do more with us, you get more. Really
encouraging customers to bring more of their wallet to us. We've seen very, very strong take up on that, a 300%
plus improvement in customers going into these relationship propositions, encouraged by the breadth of the
offering and bringing more to us. And profitability of those customers almost doubles when they migrate up. So,
we think that will give us a shot in the arm as customers look at us to consolidate relationships over.
And then maybe last would be Citizens Access. So, it gives us a great lever to raise deposits as we need it, but it
also gives us a great lever to cost contain interest bearing deposits in the consumer bank, which will allow us to
have a much more manageable betas in the core bank where we can focus on relationship banking and not
deposit raising for the sake of deposit raising. And where we need to contain deposit growth, we can do it in a
very targeted way through Citizens Access. That's proven to be exceptionally effective for us and we've had a
great quarter in growing Citizens Access here in Q1.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And so on our side, I think a lot of it surrounds the payments and treasury services business. You've heard us talk
for the last couple of years about the investment we're making in that business. It has not only been around the
core operating services but also a lot of work around deposit franchises and liquidity franchises. Frankly, one of
the things we haven't talked about is we have a liquidity advisory service and a liquidity portal which goes beyond
deposits but allows us to capture customer funds even if they are on balance sheet.
And on the deposit side over the last couple of years, we've introduced five or six new products. We talked about
the Green Deposits. We talked about Carbon Offset Deposits. We talked about escrow deposits. So, the product
set is quite broad. The other thing we saw during the disruptions is we added about 300 new deposit clients, a lot
of which interestingly came out of the JMP franchise as they referred some of the technology customers onto our
platform. Some of those are funded up. Some of those aren't funded up. But like Brendan said, the core of our
franchise is really the primary core relationships and the operating relationships, and about 66% of our deposit
base is really with core primary relationships.
And the last thing we're doing is we've turned the deposit business into a primary cross-sell. So where we were
asking for capital markets business when the capital markets were open, we're now asking for deposits and we're
framing the deposit rates in the context of our overall relationship and have gotten a very good response from a
lot of our clients.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
I was hoping you might be able to speak at sort of a top level about how commercial customers are behaving now
with their operational deposits? Like, are they keeping less in operational deposits than they would have
previously and then just spreading that money across several banks, which would imply maybe you lose some but
gain some, in other words, higher return?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And maybe a thought what commercial account openings have looked like over the past month or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. As I mentioned, we've opened about 300 new accounts over the last month, which has been encouraging.
I'd say at the top end of the client base, we've seen more diversification activity. So, the public companies which
had excess deposits kicking in around the system, some of which were surge deposits, some of those flowed out
and went to other banks. And then on the flip side, some of them flowed into us as customers balance their
deposit accounts to kind of net neutral on that.
And then, the other thing we see, frankly, and this was far before SVB and some of the disruption is clients are –
because the capital markets are kind of quiet and the lending markets are kind of quiet, clients are using some of
their cash to fund their operations and fund CapEx. So we've seen a little bit of a drift out in terms of just utilization
of excess cash balances.
And then, I'd say the core operating deposits have stayed pretty flat. I mean, people are basically toggling
between ECR and deposits, if there's a toggle. But I'd say the kind of core funding of operational activities is
relatively flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And sorry, I had missed that 300 accounts over the last month, but I appreciate all that color. And
then, maybe separately, sounds like you had some fairly constructive comments about the possibility for
investment banking to recover over the course of the year maybe in the second half. Just maybe a little more
color on how you're expecting things to traject from here, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think, we'll see. It's going to depend on what happens in the marketplace. I will say that over the last
couple weeks, we've seen a pretty strong bid in a lot of different asset classes, particularly the syndicated loan
underlying asset class. So there's some signs of life in the market, whereas it was dead quiet at the beginning of
the year. We're starting to see some transactions actually clear the market some – and kind of – and some get
restructured in ways that are, I would say, not more aggressive, but more regular way from very structured
transactions that were happening over the last couple months. So good signs of life.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
I'd say our pitch activity and our pipelines are extremely robust. And I would come back to what I said a couple
times is, in things like our M&A business, we're a middle market investment bank, and so we play in smaller-sized
transactions, say, $250 million to $1 billion, not the $5 billion to $10 billion transaction. So the financing
dependency that's in a lot of our pipelines is not as difficult as it is for the mega transaction.
So we think as things begin to stabilize and recover and the rate cycle begins to come to an end, we'll see activity
in the second half of the year, and we're seeing that in our pipelines. And then, remember, we also have a very
diverse set of capabilities now. So we're doing a lot around private equity. We're doing – meaning, placing equity
for clients into, for example, a family office or a lot of pitch activity around convertible bonds. So while some
traditional full-market products might not be fully back yet, we have a wide arsenal that we're actually deploying
on behalf of the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And let me just add to that as well and maybe flip it to John. But Scott, the fee guide is supported, I think, broadly,
not reliant just on capital markets coming back. So we have a positive outlook across card, across wealth, the
cash management business, mortgage market. So it's fairly broad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me just add one more thing, Bruce. So if the first quarter is a indication, we were down about $14
million quarter-on-quarter in syndicated finance. We were up about $13 million in our interest rate products and
commodities hedging businesses. So diversification of those fee streams, to Bruce's point, is quite important.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Just picking up on that. So I was going to make that exact point just in terms of the bond and equity
diversification along with M&A and cap markets. But in terms of card, I mean, we do see some positive outlook in
card as well, primarily in the credit card space. In mortgage, production volumes and margin is starting to recover
a bit. And that's really good to see after quite a few quarters with headwinds there.
And then, on the wealth side of things, that has just been steady for us and is continuing. Even early April, activity
has been quite strong. And so, we're feeling good in the wealth space. So it's sort of diversified across four, five
categories in terms of what we're seeing for the 2023 outlook.

Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John, you talked about lowering the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet. Can you share with us how quickly you
can take that to neutral if you wanted to as the rate environment shifts possibly toward the second half of the
year? And then, also, the cost or the strategies you would use to do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, so the way to think about that is we're pretty close to neutral now. And when you're down around
1%, there are a number of assumptions that go into that calculation, including deposit migration, et cetera. And
so, if your models are off one way or the other, you could easily be neutral. And we think about that when we
consider the fact that we have a view that the Fed may hike one more time and may be on hold.
But if inflation is more persistent and stubborn, things could rise, right, from here. So we, nevertheless, don't try to
overcook things one way or the other. But gradually getting back to neutral has served us well. And also, you
have to think about that 1% split between what's typically hedgeable and what is a little less hedgeable, and the
short end is more hedgeable.
So the construct of what the short rate exposure is, is actually less than 1%. We're actually 60:40 skewed towards
the short end. So to close that down would not take very much at all. It would be typically a shift in balance sheet
outlook and/or additional receive fixed swaps. But more broadly, we basically layered on a number of transactions
to basically get our coverage for the rest of 2023. We've got about $20 billion of coverage and receive fixed swaps
for the rest of 2023 and more like $26 billion or so for 2024.
And so, we're sort of thinking of ourselves around neutral with protection to the downside. And I would offer up
that, that will result – if, in fact, the Fed does have to lower rates by a lot, we have a view that we'll end up with a
trough NIM that's well above what we saw in our last cycle. So much more stable and a much more narrow
corridor of net interest margin than you might have seen from us in the past.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And Bruce, I like the branding you're doing in New York with the Giants. Looking forward to the day
that Citizens becomes the bank of the Yankees. So with that as a follow-up on retail, this is maybe for Brendan.
You guys gave us really good detail on slide 31 on the FICO scores. And there's a theory out there, I don't know if
17


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
it's true or not, that the FICO scores have been inflated because of what we came through during the pandemic.
Some people claim as much as 70 points. Do you guys buy into that theory? And if so, would you then expect
maybe the behaviors of your customers to be different than what the actual FICO scores are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Great question. Yeah, there is a theory out there that FICO scores were inflated with all the stimulus and
delinquency going down really, really fast. The good news is our credit underwriting is fairly sophisticated. And
while FICO is an input, it tends to be run on about 100 things that we look at including free cash flow and a whole
bunch of other different metrics in all of our businesses.
And so we've taken that into account in our underwriting. The range of real FICOs versus actual printed FICOs
during COVID was incorporated into all of our credit metrics as we kind of made new loans over the last three or
four years. So, we feel l really good about that. And I think the performance is showing that, that we think so far at
least we got that right.
And as John pointed out, we are seeing the consumer both normalize by both delinquency, and charge-offs are
still south of where they were pre-COVID. And we're not seeing an unexpected acceleration of delinquency or
charge-offs given the environment really across any of the asset classes. So – and over the years there has been
questions about some of the businesses that were faster growing in consumer and unsecured like student and
our Citizens Pay better business, those are well under control despite the great clouds surrounding us. So, we
feel really good about where we stand right now for consumer credit given the health of the consumer and the
quality of our underwriting standards.
And yet lastly, yeah, we've tightened a bunch in the last six to nine months just as a cautionary measure. So, as
we're kind of tightening up on things like auto on just size of balance sheet around the fringes and almost every
single one of our asset classes, we've made credit tightenings not because we're seeing anything we don't like,
just in an abundance of caution to make sure that we don't have any tail risk in any of the portfolio. So, as
everything we can see right now, we feel pretty good.

Good morning. On the expense side, I think, Bruce, you had alluded to potentially being able to come in below the
expense expectation, the 5% expectation maybe for the year as you're focusing on that given the top line
pressures. Can you maybe give us a little more color there, what you're looking at and how material of a potential
benefit you could have on that front as you see the top line pressure building on the NII side?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Yeah I'll start and flip to John. But we had – coming into the year, we were going with a 7% guide. Some of that
was reflective of the HSBC and ISBC full year effects and then some was the higher FDIC premiums. We've
marked that down to 5%, so clearly in recognition that we'll have some compression in the net interest income.
We're going to work really hard to try to protect the bottom line. And so, I think that's what we've circled at this
point.
Clearly, TOP remains an open program and we have lots of ideas in terms of are there other things that we can
try to get working on and actually have a benefit this year. Some of them may actually have a benefit for next
year, but certainly we've got our folks taking a hard look at what else we can do on the expense side.
But at the same time, we're trying to make sure that we protect all of the investments in our future, the important
strategic initiatives across Consumer and Commercial, across technology, and our overall client experience
organization, so that when the storm clouds pass, we're growing faster than peers. And we're in good position to
grow both the customer base, as well as our revenues. So, that's the balancing act is to keep looking for
efficiencies while making sure that we're prioritizing the things that really are important to future positioning. John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I think that's well said. I would just add that we try to calibrate our expense base along with the revenue
base that's being projected here. And so, I think you could very well see an upsize in TOP 8 in the coming
months. We're working on that. The couple of areas that we're thinking about expanding on is the further
simplification of our operating models. All of our – we've taken a look at – a harder look at all of our third-party
spend. Reimagining how we operate from an automation perspective is something that's structurally we've been
making investments in and we can double down on that going forward. And just making sure everything we're
doing is absolutely focused on our core objectives of growing a top performing bank, generating low moderate
cost deposits, and investing in our customers and clients.
And so when you put a sharp eye on all of that, you often come up with opportunities to basically create additional
efficiencies, and we've demonstrated that over the years. And then, we're going to intensify those efforts here in
the coming months.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Then just secondly on the commercial real estate front, can you give us a couple
stats that you may have on that? In terms of as you're looking at refreshing or reappraising some of the properties
in office, can you give us what you're seeing in terms of some of the value declines? We had a peer of yours
indicate 15% to 20% value declines in some of the office reappraisals. And then separately, I know you indicated
that you're seeing some pressure. You expect pressure on commercial real estate, criticized loans. Do you have
what the percentage increase was in commercial real estate criticized and what's the ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A

General criticized is running at about 24% for the office space. I don't have it for the overall real estate bucket at
the time, but office is what we're very focused on. We haven't seen a lot of appraisals yet because we're not really
in the restructuring mode. The ones we've seen have actually been modestly better than we expected. I don't
have the exact downdraft, but our entry LTVs are around 60%. So, there's a lot of cushion in our underwriting of
commercial real estate.

As Bruce and John said, we've really staffed up our workout teams and we're really putting each individual
property, each individual MSA under the microscope. We're focused on maturities in the office, but we have about
60% of the book maturing by the end of 2024. So, it's not a huge amount. And we have a majority of the risk in the
book swapped or fixed in terms of interest rate protection. So, while we're beginning to engage client by client,
remember the way we're very smooth – we're very kind of focused on who we're doing business with. So, client
selection is very important. MSA is very important. Suburban versus urban is very important. And so, we think
we'll have some trouble in the book and we're going to have to restructure a lot of the transactions. It's going to be
very manageable in terms of the overall loss content.
