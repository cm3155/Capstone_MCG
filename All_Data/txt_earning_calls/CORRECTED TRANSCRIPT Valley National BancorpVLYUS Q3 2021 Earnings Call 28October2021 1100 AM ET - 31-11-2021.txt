industry. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings including those found on Form 8-K, 10-Q
and 10-K for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. As usual, I will provide some big picture thoughts on
Valley's position and future opportunities, before I turn the call over to Mike to discuss the quarter's results. In the
third quarter of 2021, we reported net income of $123 million, earnings per share of $0.29 and return on average
assets of 1.18%.
The quarter's strong financial results benefited from our differentiated loan growth, which helped to absorb a $10
million sequential reduction in PPP income. Our net interest margin remained stable and our strong loan growth
pipeline should result in continued non-PPP revenue growth going forward. I am proud of our financial results and
the progress that we have made as an organization over the last few years. When I took over as CEO, we laid out
a plan to enhance our profitability, improve our funding base and bolster our capital and reserve positions.
Despite a challenging operating backdrop, I believe that we have achieved each of these goals.
Since the end of 2017, our ROA has improved from 80 basis points to 120 basis points, while the balance sheet
grew by over $17 billion or 70%. We have brought our loan to deposit ratio well below 100% while significantly
improving our low cost core deposit base. Our tangible common equity ratio has increased 100 basis points and
our allowance to loans is up over 40 basis points.
While we have developed a leading regional bank, our sights are now set on positioning Valley for continued
success during the next phase of our evolution. We have begun to introduce and expand nationwide business
capabilities that are not constrained to our legacy geographic footprint. These capabilities will be the result of both
internal development initiatives and the acquisitions that we have announced over the last few months. From an
organic perspective, we have developed robust HOA, cannabis and digital banking offerings, which each
contributed valuable funding diversity and represented levers for continued growth.
We also operate national lending verticals, most notably in the equipment finance, premium finance and
healthcare areas. We have also leveraged our relationship-focused commercial lending expertise to enter new
markets, including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.
On the acquisition front, we have sought out like-minded partners that we believe will accelerate the next phase of
our evolution. Bank Leumi's technology banking and private banking businesses will continue to expand Valley
beyond our legacy markets. Leumi's differentiated commercial funding verticals will augment the Valley-specific
initiatives that I mentioned previously.
As we continue to capitalize on these unique funding niches, we will continue to be less and less reliant upon our
branch network. This will enable us to reduce our physical infrastructure and invest in technologies and
differentiated business capabilities. This strategy has not been set in a vacuum, and we are not sitting idly by as
the banking industry undergoes massive change.
Historic levels of bank M&A have left a void for companies like ours that are able to combine comprehensive and
differentiated [ph] private (00:05:07) offerings with the agility and high touch service of a smaller organization. As

we capitalize on the disruption around us, Valley is positioned to be a high performing and highly valued company
that succeeds in the new age of banking.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to discuss some of the quarter's financial highlights.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 4, you can see Valley's recent net interest income and margin trends with and
without the impacts of PPP. Net interest income was flat for the quarter, despite a $10 million reduction in PPP
income. This reflected funding cost reductions and higher non-PPP loan income resulting from our strong growth
over the last few quarters.
On a reported basis, net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 3.15%. However, exclusive of PPP income, the
net interest margin would have been flat at 3.07%. With fewer opportunities to redeem higher cost debt, we
utilized cash to modestly grow the securities portfolio during the quarter. As cash balances remain elevated, we
are likely to continue this deployment for the next few quarters. Despite our efforts, the higher average cash
balance weighed on our quarterly net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points.
Slide 5 illustrates the ongoing transition of our funding base. Over the last few years, we have refocused and
accelerated our commercial deposit growth and rolled out new funding niches that will provide additional sources
of low cost, sticky deposits going forward. These efforts have enabled us to reduce our reliance on higher cost
CDs and borrowings to 22% of funding from 44% at the end of 2019.
Our continued focus on scaling these initiatives will benefit us as the liquidity environment normalizes. We
continue to transition deposits from CDs to lower cost transaction accounts. Our active management of deposit
costs in all buckets has also contributed to our recent margin stability. During the quarter, our CD and non-
maturity deposit cost declined 11 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively. Over the next 12 months, we have
approximately $3.3 billion of CDs set to mature at an average cost of 31 basis points. While this represents
another opportunity to reprice funding costs lower, the potential impact will be less meaningful than what we have
experienced over the last few quarters.
Slide 6 details our loan balances and origination trends over the last few quarters. We continue to experience very
strong lending activity across our markets and asset classes. The quarter's loan originations were split almost
evenly between commercial, southeast commercial, and residential and consumer. Importantly, our average
origination yield increased 5 basis points and spreads remain attractive. Exclusive of PPP, loans increased 2%
from the prior quarter. You can see at the top left the composition of our portfolio.
Based on our view of the portfolio, approximately 45% is commercial real estate and 28% is commercial business,
which includes owner-occupied CRE. Our diverse loan portfolio is a key differentiator for our organization and the
multiple growth levers have contributed to our strong year-to-date results. We continue to believe that loan growth
will remain at the high end of the middle single digit guidance we provided previously. Our loan pipeline stands at
approximately $3 billion and recent lending hires are beginning to contribute more production to our portfolio.
Moving to slide 7, we generated non-interest income of $42 million for the quarter. The $3.7 million decline in
gain-on-sale income was largely mitigated by higher swap income, service charges and other income. Earlier this
month, we announced the acquisition of Dudley Ventures. Dudley generates fee income through the placement
and management of tax credit investments and will support our efforts to build differentiated sources of non-
interest income.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
On slide 8, you can see that our reported expenses were $175 million for the quarter, [ph] exclusive of (00:09:52)
tax credit amortization and both merger charges and a litigation reserve which flowed through our professional fee
line, adjusted expenses were $168 million. The adjusted increase was concentrated in compensation costs,
consulting fees, and the other expense category.
There were a few key drivers of higher compensation costs during the quarter. The first is elevated origination
activity over the last few quarters, which has impacted performance-based compensation accruals and
commissions. We also increased our branch compensation to preserve staffing and service levels and to keep
pace with the increases in wage demand across the industry.
We continue to invest in areas that we believe will drive outsized revenue growth in the future. During the quarter,
we rolled out a new National Deposit Group and continued to attract leading talent in our digital products area. We
utilized consultants to assist on other process improvement initiatives. We expect that these consulting costs will
fluctuate going forward.
We also recognized nearly $2.5 million of other periodic costs and fair value marks during the quarter. These
expenses are difficult to predict from a timing perspective. While we do not expect these elevated costs to
continue in the fourth quarter, some are market-driven and activity-based.
Since the beginning of 2018, our revenue growth has outpaced expense growth 42% to 17%. This is a strong
track record in a challenging environment, and we will continue to produce positive operating leverage over time.
In the short term, we may absorb expenses that position us for stronger revenue growth down the road. But we
remain thoughtful in the investments that we make and ensure that we execute on the significant opportunities
available to us. While the timing of certain expenses and investments may cause volatility in our operating
leverage in the near term, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage over the long
term.
Turning to slide 9, you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses declined
to 1.12% of non-PPP loans at September 30 from 1.14% at June 30, 2021. Third quarter net charge-offs were de
minimis, and our $4 million provision was the result of the strong loan growth during the quarter.
For the second consecutive quarter, an improved economic forecast led us to reduce our weighting on Moody's
downside scenarios. Our model is now currently 70% weighted to the baseline scenario, which has positively
impacted our reserve levels. Our nonaccrual loan balances ticked up to 77 basis points from 68 basis points of
total loans in the prior quarter. This increase was driven by three commercial real estate credits that transitioned
out of early stage delinquency. The credits total $33 million and carry a specific reserve of nearly $4 million. Early
stage accruing past due loans declined during the quarter and our COVID-related deferrals fell below $100
million. COVID deferrals now stand at just 0.3% of loans, and additional detail on outstanding loan deferrals can
be found in the appendix.
Slide 10 illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and our continued capital strength. Tangible
book value has increased 9% in the last 12 months, driven by our strong earnings performance.
Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio increased to 7.95% as September 30 from 7.73% at June 30,
2021. PPP loans reduced our tangible common equity ratio by approximately 18 basis points at the end of the
quarter. Total risk-based capital declined 12 basis points in the quarter as a result of the partial disallowance of
certain legacy subordinated debt tranches. You will recall that our successful subordinated debt offering during

the second quarter was done partially to prefund this disallowance. We remain very comfortable with all of our
capital ratios and believe that our strong earnings will support our organic growth efforts going forward.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.
Your line is now open.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Steven.

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the expense side, quite a few items came in a bit above what we were expecting. Do you
guys consider the $168.5 million adjusted as a good run rate? And how should we think about expense growth
just given the wage pressures that you guys called out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I'll take a stab at this one, Steven. When we look at the current expense level, we expect the fourth quarter
expenses to be within a range of roughly $165 million to $170 million. But as I said in my prepared remarks, some
of those expenses are in people and compensation-related areas that address specifically what you asked around
higher compensation costs, especially in the retail part of our business. We also have hired, as I mentioned, a
National Deposits Group. And we also have significant hiring in our digital group as well.
You may have seen recently our cannabis-related digital product offering that was recently at a trade show, was
predominantly seen as a new product in the marketplace. So we're making investments up-front in these areas
that will result in higher growth and higher revenue down the road. They don't always obviously line up with one
another.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Actually, I wanted to follow up on the launch of Valley Pay. Will that platform apply
only to the cannabis business or is it more broad? And maybe could you just walk us through the benefit that that
will provide the companies in the cannabis industry?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Steven. I think it provides the beginning of a payment platform for the industry, which really doesn't exist
today. We're trying to work with our customers here to figure out a solution as to how they can connect with their
customers in a safe and secure manner. So while this closed loop platform provides the initial ability for them to
accept payments from a digital perspective, we do believe that there will be alternative offerings as we continue to
really grow this. So we do believe that there is additional opportunities associated with this.
And that said, I think as we think about the growth here and whether it applies to different industries, I think there's
definitely opportunities. And one of the things that we're fortunate to be is the size organization we are. We were
able to hire some wonderful talent to come here and look at doing things a little bit differently. We were able to
stand up this platform in six months, which I think is unique compared to what other organizations are able to
really do. And that culture, that environment, I really do think creates opportunity when it comes to a multitude of
different product sets throughout the organization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And I'll add one more thing maybe to the end of that. As I said in my prepared remarks, operating leverage is very
important to us and so we haven't lost sight of that over the long haul and neither should any of the sell side
analysts as well. But as you well know, cyclicality in expenses sometimes come into play and there's times to
invest when the market conditions are right, and there's times to scale back and it's our belief at this point right
now that scaling up in certain areas makes sense given what's going on in the broader economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then my final question, just on this acquisition of Dudley Ventures, can you just walk us
through their business model and what type of financial contribution should we expect from that deal? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, the financial part of it, we haven't talked about publicly. So it's not going to be material from a financial
perspective. But, essentially, what Dudley does is they are a tax credit recipient from the federal government and
then they work with clients who want to have tax credits as part of their investment portfolio. So they're the entity
that makes sure that those credits get to the right places. There have been several banks that have been in this
industry as well. But I think the bigger part of this is it's another thing that we can do, do effectively and sell into
our existing customer base. That's really the reason that we did this.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. I want to stick on the cannabis sector for a
second. I was wondering, Ira, if you're willing to kind of try and size up the market share opportunity in some way
or the addressable market there for us. I mean it seems like there's only a handful of banks really operating in the
space in any way today. And most of them, at least that I read, it's more of just like, hey, we're willing to take your
deposits, not really anyone that's trying to really provide kind of solutions, any points of friction, like Valley Pay
theoretically might solve. So just curious if you could help us maybe kind of think of the overall scope of that
market. I mean, it seems like you guys are kind of fast movers here and just trying to get a better handle of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, thank you. I definitely think our approach is very differentiated. To your point, Michael, most of our
competition in the space has looked at it as how I can benefit them from a deposit or from a fee perspective. And
our approach has been very different in talking to our potential customers and current customers as to how we
can be advisory and think about solutions for them that really makes sense. So we've started out targeting the
multistate operators, and we have a very strong relationship with each of them as to how we think we can provide
benefits to them as they think about growing their overall businesses.
Keep in mind, it's a very immature business at this point, which creates a lot of opportunity for us to think
collaboratively with them as to how we can provide value for them, which also nursed our overall bottom line. It's a
very segmented business today and we think that we provide a leading opportunity to gain significant market
share in this business today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And is the Valley Pay – are there deposit opportunities around this payment infrastructure? I'm trying to kind of
think about the technology itself and think of some of the other – like there's some of the other real-time payment
platforms that some of your competitors have done whether there's actually decent deposit generation because
people have to hold cash with the banks to move it around. And is there kind of longer term, as more people
adopt this payment technology that you guys are rolling out, is there kind of deposit growth opportunity that kind of
move lockstep with it?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Absolutely. This is a closed loop platform, which basically provides an opportunity from a deposit perspective,
from the dispensary side, as well as from the consumer side. So we think we'll be able to gain deposits on both
sides. And once again, it's a market that is very difficult to enter today. It took us 18 months to begin to get into
this as to how we thought about the risk appetite, the compliance components associated with it, and to stand up
the overall platform, and once again work with our customers to make sure that we're providing a value-added
service to them. So we think there's absolutely a deposit opportunity on both sides here because it's a closed loop
platform as well as being a fee opportunity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Two more things I want to hit on quickly just, Mike, I was curious if you could maybe provide an update on
how you think the balance sheet is positioned for higher short-term rates? Obviously, there's a lot going on and,
kind of, beneath the [ph] engine here (00:22:50) and then the funding basis kind of moving towards some lower
cost, seemingly maybe more sticky instruments, and the loan portfolio is more diverse than it's been historically. I
was wondering if you could just provide some updated thoughts once all these deals are kind of put together
where you think the bank positioning stands?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I think our positioning has probably never been better in the history of the company, to be honest. I know in
the last decade-plus, we've never had a lower cost of deposits at 18 basis points. And as you can see in the
investor presentation, the loan yield on newly originated loans is actually up 5 basis points.
So we feel really good about both sides of the balance sheet as it relates to how we're funding ourselves. The
growth there has been – speaks for itself. It's been unbelievable and what's going on on the lending side, which
on an 8% linked-quarter annualized basis, we feel it's right in line with what we've talked about, but we feel very
good about that as it relates to the future.
As it relates to changes in interest rates, you can see that in our SEC filings. We are asset sensitive and maybe
not so much to your question, but I think it's important. Leumi that will be part of our organization, assuming we
get approvals, will be part of our organization next year, they're also asset sensitive and that's going to help us
become even more asset sensitive. And just to dimension that, in an up 100 basis point parallel change in interest
rates, our net interest income would be expected to go up somewhere in the neighborhood of around 4% or so.
And I think, as we continue to work with our cash balances as well, you're only going to see that number increase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And that 4%, that's just where the balance sheet stood at quarter end, so moving to be a bit additive to that,
correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. That is correct.

Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. And then just lastly, and then I'll hop out is just on the credits, appreciate the
color. There were a pick-up in nonaccrual, some pick-up in delinquencies across some of the reporting New York
City metro banks, we'll generally call it. And just curious if there's anything kind of more brewing or anything you're
keeping your eye on? I mean it seems like the incidents were fairly isolated, but to see it happen at a few banks.
I'm just curious if there's some kind of real estate churn that might maybe get value down or anything that we
should be mindful of on the credit side as we move into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, it's Tom. So, I'll give you an answer on that. Yeah. As you saw, our accruing past-dues went down pretty
much in relation to the increase in those delinquencies specific to three loans totaling $33 million, all independent
separate borrowers. All three were in COVID-impacted industries, two in retail, one in hospitality. We certainly
watch it very, very closely. We're properly reserved, we don't expect any losses, we have good loan to values and
guarantees where appropriate on that.
Just want to remind you, our portfolio continues to be very granular and very diverse. Our loan production on the
real estate side for the third quarter, the average loan size was $3.6 million. So we still look at that, maintaining
our underwriting standings, maintaining a granular portfolio, much more suburban than urban on what we do. On
the commercial deferrals, we have $79 million in commercial deferrals. 96% of that is current on interest. Only a
very small percent has principal deferrals. So we don't expect any material migration into any further nonaccruals.

that the plus 100 basis points in the last Q changed NII by 3%. So I don't think any of this is directionally
inconsistent with what you would've expected before.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes, appreciate that. Thank you, Travis. And then just on the Valley Pay app, is that an app that you guys are
developing in-house or is this a white labeled app?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It's really I mean definitely I think you should be thinking of it more about a whole digital [ph] payment (00:28:11)
ecosystem, Steven, as opposed to just what this individual app is. It's something we've been able to build
internally with the partners obviously and working with partners as we continue to roll this out. We do believe
there is opportunity once again from a fee income perspective, not just directly for this, but from a fee income
perspective as to how we think about working with other banks that do potentially look at getting into this business
down the road.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just maybe just one last one just on the nonaccruals, if we go back in time – your
nonaccruals right now are 77 basis points. Is there a kind of a level that you see that you guys are – when would
you not be comfortable with the nonaccrual levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think we're confident that the nonaccrual levels should not migrate upwards from where they are. And, again, we
monitor, watch closely, maintain our underwriting standards in a very granular diverse portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And I'll add to that real quickly that, while I'm not going to give you a number because I think it's market
dependent and obviously depends upon the size of the portfolio as well, I think the bigger issue here is these are
still very low numbers on a relative basis. And as you look backwards, since you asked about looking backwards,

if you look backwards, you'll notice that our loss history, including nonaccruals migrating to loss is roughly half of
what our peer group was. So our credit quality, we still feel very comfortable based upon the fact that that's been
the history of what we've been able to put up.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I will limit my questions out of respect for everyone else on the call. But in terms of loan growth, your comments
about the high end of the mid-single digit guidance, when you think about growth over the next 12 months, does it
really come sort of more of the same? I mean I was looking at slide 6, like the non-owner-occupied CRE, auto, so
I guess that's the first part of the question. And then just also what would it take to drive higher core C&I
balances? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, it's Tom Iadanza. One thing I'll point out here is that we had a 5% increase in our C&I commercial line
commitments during the quarter. What we don't have is yet utilization. We're really not going to benefit from that
growth until the utilization returns to pre-pandemic norms. So we are increasing C&I customers. The new hires
that we onboarded, they represented about 7% of our quarterly production and 55% of what they produced was
C&I-related. So we are starting to see that.
And keep in mind, previously, we've put together a focused C&I sales process that we've been running for a
couple of years here now. It's got slowed down a bit during the pandemic, but we are very focused on generating
C&I business. We're seeing it through the new hires. We're seeing it in our line commitment growth and ultimately
we're going to see it in the utilization.

Got it. Sorry. And then the rest of the question just in terms of like other areas of growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I'm sorry. I didn't get that second part.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sorry. The first part of my question was just – and I appreciate your comment on C&I. My point was in terms of
the other areas of growth...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I got it. Yeah. I think you're going to see consistent in those same buckets. You're seeing growth in that
owner-occupied real estate, which is really C&I-related. That represent probably 30% of our production during the
quarter. We have expanded into Pennsylvania, Nashville, Atlanta. We're seeing strong growth in pipelines and
production in each of those markets.
And I'll just remind people it's a very methodical approach to how we enter. They're contiguous to offices we
presently have. We go in there first with customers, understand the market, and then we add local lenders and
leadership in that market to grow it further. You're starting to see traction there. Pipeline in Pennsylvania alone is
almost $300 million. In the Nashville, Atlanta, it's in that $250 million range and we've already produced and
closed loans in each of those markets. So you'll continue to see that. That's going to be primarily real estate-
related. We continue through these new hires to focus on C&I. We're seeing their production increase quarter-to-
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And just I guess you asked also about the consumer piece, strong pipeline still in the resi side. We are
experiencing what we had reported last quarter a reduction in the auto side, mostly due to supply chain and we're
seeing a strong migration on the resi purchase piece down in Florida, which now represents 26% of our
production, up from 20%.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, first, going back to expenses, you mentioned $165 million to $170 million for the fourth quarter. Is that all in
or excluding amortization?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Excluding the tax credit amortization that we typically back out [ph] for (00:34:17) the adjusted expenses, so if you
look at our adjusted expenses this quarter, the $168.5 million, we think it's kind of right in the middle of what that
range we laid out for the fourth quarter would be. Because don't forget in the fourth quarter, we're also going to
have some impact on top of that from Westchester, which we expect to close on December 1. And there will be
obviously noise related to merger charges on both transactions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then you mentioned also that we should expect some fluctuation in consultant-related
expenses. Is there a band of fluctuation you can share with us that we should just be aware of and grow
accustomed to at least in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
No. There's not a band, but this kind of follows investments, right, mostly around technology. So when there's a
ramp-up, you have an increase in that. Honestly, the reason they're not called off or called out on slide 8 is
individually any one of them isn't material from a GAAP perspective. Collectively, maybe they're not quite
material, but they're getting there and that expense is going to move up and down based upon the various needs
that we have in the various technology projects that we have. So it's very difficult for us to look several quarters
into the future and say with certainty what those expenses will be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And maybe I can just add a little bit on top of that too. If you back out the merger and the litigation reserve from
that professional fee line, Matt, there was about a $2.5 million increase quarter-over-quarter. About $0.5 million of
that was on the legal side, and the other $2 million were in the consulting side. And there were a couple of
consultants in there that would not recur in the fourth quarter. But it's not to say that we wouldn't have other costs
to kind of backfill it. So that's why we say fluctuate, if that makes sense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then last one for me, you mentioned expanding it to Philadelphia, that totally
makes sense given geography, but you also mentioned Nashville and Atlanta, which are new markets to me. I

guess those are extensions of the Birmingham presence you have. Could you just give us some update on
infrastructure or personnel you have in Nashville and Atlanta, perhaps some indication of what loans and deposits
are there already?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. The Nashville and Atlanta, yes, there is an extension of our Birmingham business and office. We have a
real estate team in Birmingham. We have a strong customer base that are doing business in both Nashville and
Atlanta. So our initial foray is following them into those markets. Just to give you kind of some numbers on it, we
have already closed about $70 million of loans in those markets. I mentioned the pipeline before of around $260
million. And in the last quarter, we did about $65 million of new loans in those markets. So it's going to be again a
slower go to start utilizing the staff that we have in Birmingham, their customers, to learn those markets. And once
we're comfortable, we'll move into those markets with staff in each of those cities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Same way we did in Philadelphia. We started Philadelphia following customers. We now have a staff of four
people based in Philadelphia.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about fee income. You mentioned about swap income was
higher in the quarter. I was curious about the outlook for the swap fees as well as commentary around mortgage
banking and gain on sale.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, on the swap side, even though it's higher [indiscernible] (00:38:17) relatively consistent, except for one very
large quarter we had last year, we expect it to stay at that level for the fourth quarter and into the foreseeable
future based on existing pipeline. The same with the gain on sale. We expect it to be in a similar level to what we
reported in the third quarter.
