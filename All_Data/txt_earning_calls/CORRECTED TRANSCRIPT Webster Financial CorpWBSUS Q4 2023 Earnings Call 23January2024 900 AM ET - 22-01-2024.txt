President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks a lot, Emlen. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's fourth quarter
2023 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll provide remarks on our high level results and
operations before turning it over to Glenn to cover our financial results in greater detail.
The company continues to execute at a high level and we are excited about the momentum we are carrying into
2024. With less distraction from our integration activities and hopefully the industry at large, we are well
positioned to continue delivering financial outperformance as we deliver for our clients across business lines.
I'm going to start the review today with our full-year results for 2023. As I've stated throughout the year, we
performed admirably throughout a difficult period for the banking industry. This performance illustrates the
strength of our franchise, including a uniquely diverse and sound funding base, highly efficient operating model
and focus on non-commoditized businesses.
We grew our adjusted EPS to $5.99 from $5.62 in the prior year, generating record EPS for Webster. We reached
a record tangible book value per share in the fourth quarter as well. Our return on assets was 1.43%, our return
on tangible common equity was 20.5%, and we ended the year with a 42% efficiency ratio.
In addition to our strong financial performance, we realized several meaningful strategic accomplishments. We
capably executed our core technology conversion and have completed substantially all of the work on our merger
integration. We closed the interLINK acquisition and we announced the acquisition of Ametros. We grew core
deposits through a highly competitive environment in the banking industry, illustrating our funding advantage and

the strength of our relationship-oriented business model. We also refined our mix of businesses, emphasizing and
building those where we have a strategic advantage and the most promising risk/reward characteristics.
On the next slide, our fourth quarter financial results remain solid. On an adjusted basis, we produced a return on
tangible common equity of 19.8% and a return on assets of nearly 1.4%. Our adjusted EPS was a $1.46. We
grew our deposits and loans each by roughly 1%, with loan growth focused in strategic commercial categories.
We continue to exhibit solid expense control with an efficiency ratio of 43%.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity remain strong at 11.12% and 7.73%, respectively.
Our strong starting point and internal capital generation capability will provide us with a significant amount of
operating flexibility over the long term.
The timing of some of our fourth quarter accomplishments, including our solid loan growth, were back-loaded,
resulting in a period-end loan and securities balance that were more than $1 billion higher than the average
balances. Our overall loan growth, coupled with a robust pipeline, should provide us with a tailwind as we head
into 2024.
The following slide illustrates our funding diversity, which highlights one of our key strategic advantages. We are
confident that we are adding another unique funding vertical with our acquisition of Ametros, which we announced
at the end of last year and expect to close shortly. We provide some detail on the business on the following slide.
Ametros is a particularly unique and exciting opportunity for Webster as it provides low-cost, fast-growing
deposits, which add significant fee income. To describe the business in brief, Ametros administers recipients'
funds from medical claims settlement via a proprietary technology platform and service teams. A large majority of
the claims Ametros administered are structured as annuities whereby funds are replenished over the life of the
recipient. As of today, there are over $2.5 billion of contracted deposit inflows under this construct. Given this
replenishment feature, the average deposit duration exceeds 20 years.
The collection and retention of these funds is further enhanced by the value-added services Ametros provides,
including payment management, access to discounted medical services and government reporting. They have an
ardent customer base, as evidenced by a net promoter score of 96% and are by far the market leader among
professional administrators.
We expect deposits will grow at a 25% CAGR over the ensuing five years. Our projected growth trajectory
assumes the growth of members and no changes to Ametros' existing business constitution, including the addition
of new relationships, new business verticals, medical inflation or synergies with Webster's existing businesses.
For all of these, we see varying degrees of opportunity.
We anticipate the transaction will be modestly accretive to 2024 earnings and 3% accretive to 2025 earnings. We
look forward to officially welcoming our new colleagues in the near future. Our overall credit profile and key credit
metrics remain fairly unchanged from prior quarter as we continue to proactively manage our credit exposures
across the bank. Glenn will provide more detail in his comments.
On the next slide, I'll quickly touch on the standard overview of our office CRE portfolio. We continue to make
solid progress on reducing the size of this portfolio, which is down another $120 million this quarter. The majority
of the reduction came from either payoffs or properties being repositioned. Overall performance of the portfolio
continues to be relatively consistent with solid support underlying the credits. We did see a tick-up in classified

loans to 7.7% from 5% last quarter, but delinquencies and nonaccruals are nonexistent. Given we were getting to
a much smaller absolute balance, we will likely move this slide to the appendix in future quarters.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to cover our financials in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the
fourth quarter.
We reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $181 million with earnings per share of $1.05. On an
adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $250 million, an EPS of $1.46. The largest
component of the adjustments were $47 million FDIC special assessment, $31 million in merger-related expense
and securities repositioning loss of $17 million.
Next, I'll review balance sheet trends beginning on slide 8. Total assets were $75 billion at period-end of $1.8
billion from the third quarter. Our securities balances were up $1.5 billion from the third quarter. $400 million of the
increase was attributed to value appreciation of our AFS portfolio while the remaining $1.1 million reflects
incremental action we took to reduce our asset sensitivity.
Much of the securities growth occurred late in the fourth quarter with the associated net interest income benefit to
be realized in the first quarter. As I noted a moment ago, we also repositioned roughly $400 million of our
securities portfolio with less than one-year earn-back. This should result in the benefit of 3 basis points to our net
interest margin in the first quarter.
Loans were up $640 million driven by commercial categories. The majority of the growth occurred late in the
quarter, resulting in a period-end balance that was higher than average by $375 million. Deposits grew by $450
million in the quarter, the net result of seasonal declines in public sector funds offset by growth in CDs, interLINK
and interest-bearing checking. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 83%, flat to last quarter. Our capital levels remain
strong. Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.12%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.7%.
Tangible book value increased to $32.39 per share or just under 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting earnings
and the improvement in AOCI. In a steady interest rate environment, we anticipate $75 million of unrealized
security losses would accrete back into capital annually.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 9. In total, loans are up roughly $650 million or 1.3% on a linked-quarter
basis. The Commercial Bank continues to drive loan trends where we grew the C&I and commercial real estate
portfolios. On net, much of the growth was in low-risk, lower-yielding portfolios. Growth in C&I was principally in
fund banking and public sector finance as well as business banking.
Commercial real estate growth was in stronger risk-rated portfolios, including multifamily. Notably, we ran off
remaining balances in mortgage warehouse. The yield on the loan portfolio increased 4 basis points, and floating
and periodic loans were 59% of total loans at quarter-end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 10 with total deposits up $450 million from prior quarter or 0.7%.
We saw growth in all major deposit product categories with the exception of demand and money market accounts
where seasonality in public funds drove declines. Our total deposit costs were up 19 basis points to 215 basis
points for a cumulative cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 40%.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
On slide 11, we rolled forward our deposit beta assumptions to incorporate the first quarter, during which we
anticipate our beta to reach 41%.
Moving to slide 12, we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for
the prior period. Overall, adjusted net income was down $17 million relative to prior quarter. Net interest income
was down $16 million, as anticipated balance sheet growth was achieved later in the quarter and we continue to
run off non-strategic loans.
Adjusted non-interest income was down $10 million, largely driven by a non-cash swing in our modeled credit
valuation adjustment on customer derivatives. Partially offsetting these trends, expenses were down $1.6 million
and the provision was down $0.5 million. We also benefited from a lower tax rate, 19.5% this quarter, down from
20.1% in the third quarter as a result of state and local true-ups. Our efficiency ratio was 43%.
On slide 13, we highlight net interest income, which declined $16 million linked quarter. This was driven by a later-
than-anticipated growth in our earning assets in addition to run-off of non-strategic portfolios. Net interest margin
decreased 7 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.42%. As a result of the timing of our fourth quarter earning
asset growth and forecasted originations in Q1, we expect to grow both net interest income and NIM into the first
quarter.
Our yield on earning assets increased 5 basis points over prior quarter. The pace of deposit pricing moderated to
19 basis points, while the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was up 14 basis points. The increase is driven by
a periodic change in deposit mix, primarily due to the seasonal decline in public funds with offsetting growth
coming in higher-yielding deposit categories and wholesale funding.
On slide 14, we highlight non-interest income, which was down $10 million to prior quarter on an adjusted basis.
$8 million of the decline was attributable to a non-cash swing in model credit valuation adjustment on customer
derivatives. This resulted in a $4 million charge this quarter relative to a $4 million benefit last quarter. We also
experienced seasonal decline in HSA interchange fees, and transaction activity tied to commercial clients
remained slow in the fourth quarter.
Non-interest expense is on slide 15. We reported adjusted expenses of $299 million, down $2 million from the
prior quarter. Reductions in reoccurring FDIC insurance and technology costs were partially offset by increased
marketing and employee benefit costs.
Slide 16 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which was effectively flat relative to prior quarter.
After recording $34 million in net charge-offs, we incurred a $34 million provision. $26 million of which was
attributable to macro and credit factors, and $8 million of which was attributable to loan growth. As a result, our
allowance coverage to loans decreased modestly to 125 basis points from 127 basis points last quarter, in part
reflecting the mix shift to loans with lower loss content.
Slide 17 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, nonperforming assets are flat to prior quarter
and up slightly to prior year, with nonperforming loans representing just 41 basis points of total loans. Commercial
classifieds as a percent of commercial loans increased to 182 basis points from 174 basis points, as classified
loans increased by $44 million on an absolute basis.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Net charge-offs on the upper right totaled $34 million or 27 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis.
We divested another $51 million of commercial loans in the quarter and $21 million of residential loans. These
divestitures resulted in $14 million of the $34 million in net charge-offs.
On slide 18, we maintain strong capital levels. All capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal
targets. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.12% and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.7%; our
tangible book value was $32.39 a share.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 19 with our outlook for 2024. The outlook includes the pro forma impact of
Ametros, which directly impacts deposits, net interest income fees and expenses. We expect loans to grow in the
range of 5% to 7%. Growth will continue to be driven by our commercial businesses. Likewise, we expect
deposits to grow 5% to 7%. We expect net interest income of $2.4 billion to $2.45 billion on a non-FTE basis. For
those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly $75 million to the outlook. Our net
interest income outlook assumes four decreases in the Fed funds rate beginning in May.
Non-interest income is forecast to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million. This includes approximately $25
million in fees generated by Ametros. Expenses are expected to be in the $1.3 billion to a $1.325 billion. This
includes approximately $50 million due to the addition of Ametros, representing both operating costs and the
estimated intangible amortization or efficiency ratios expected to be in the low- to mid-40% range. We expect an
effective tax rate of 21%.
We'll continue to be prudent managers of capital and target a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of approximately
10.5%. With Ametros expected to close shortly, we anticipate rebuilding capital in the near term, after which we
are committed to utilizing roughly 40% of our earnings per share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions similar to
those that we have announced in the past couple of years.
With that, I'll turn it back to John for closing remarks.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. Despite continued industry headwinds, we remain optimistic about our prospects for 2024.
Webster is in an advantageous position as we enter the year with good momentum. In a challenging year for the
banking industry last year, we were able to add to our capabilities and grow the bank. Streamlining our technology
will allow us to more efficiently improve our product and service offerings. We've also taken steps to reduce our
earnings volatility.
Our funding position and capital generation provide us with a great opportunity to grow the company in
strategically compelling areas. We'll continue to invest in our people and technology, further enabling that
opportunity. Given these dynamics and the starting point for our efficiency ratio, we will make these investments
while maintaining pure leading profitability and returns.
I'm going to conclude my remarks with a few acknowledgments of thanks. As we near the two-year anniversary of
the merger with Sterling, Jack Kopnisky will move out of his role as Executive Chairman of the company and I will
become Chair. Jack's counsel and partnership in building our company has been valuable the past two years, and
the company would not be where it is today without his vision and significant contributions. As this is the last
earnings call prior to the February 1 transition, I want to take this opportunity to publicly offer our collective thanks
to Jack.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Thank you to our colleagues for their efforts and on behalf of our shareholders and clients. 2023 was a
challenging year in terms of industry turmoil and the work that went into completing our core conversion. Our
colleagues put in a ton of work building our franchise and achieving our 2023 financial results.
Thank you all for joining us on the call today. Operator, Glenn and I will open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one
follow-up. And any additional questions, please re-queue. Your first question comes from the line of Mark
Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Hey, guys. Good morning.

John R. Ciulla A

Morning, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First question I had. Glenn, based on where yields are today, do you plan to continue to grow and extend the
securities book in the first quarter to sort of further reduce asset sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, Mark. Thanks. We did – as you probably saw, we did add about $1.1 billion in securities at the end of the
fourth quarter. So I think that bodes well going into the next couple of quarters. And actually, we did it
opportunistically at a high rate environment. So we feel good about that. But the real intent was to further
minimize our asset sensitivity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
But, Glenn, do you plan to continue to do that in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, it'll be – not to the extent that it's $1 billion, but it will be at a smaller level. And with reinvest, we
have approximately $300 million coming off the quarter in our invested securities portfolio, which will be
reinvestment.

Okay. And then just real quick, secondly, did you sell any office loans or loan notes in the quarter? And if so,
where did you sell them relative to par?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
We did, Mark, I would say, and we've been talking about this, the kind of progressive decline in the market values.
I think mid-80s. But the loan sales were smaller this quarter and they weren't all office. So we did do some
balance sheet repositioning but not as robustly and not in bulk like we had in the last few quarters. As I noted, the
$120 million decline in the quarter in office, this quarter, interestingly, was primarily from payoffs and refinances at
market in par. So we didn't do a lot of office sales this quarter.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I was hoping we could touch on loan yields. Expansion was a bit less, and I was expecting this quarter up 4 bps in
the 6.4 bps. And I was curious, one, what are incremental loan yields today? Have they changed quarter to
quarter? And then is the fact that we saw a slowdown in loan yield expansion tied to just the lack of Fed hikes or
could you provide more color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I mean, I just did the numbers at the beginning. So in the fourth quarter, our commercial loan yields
were 760 basis points for what was originated in the fourth quarter, and total loans was pretty much same range, I
think 758 basis points, somewhere around there. And – go ahead.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Yeah. Matt, so it's interesting rate and obviously we hit on it in the beginning. We had back-ended loan
originations in the quarter which hurt NII growth. And we also, if you look year-over-year, right, we have $650
million less than mortgage warehouse because we've exited that business.
The other dynamic there is that the mix of business was high-quality, non-office commercial real estate fund
banking, which had almost a full point of lower weighted average risk rating, but on the other side, also lower
yielding. So we didn't see as much origination, I would say, given market conditions and given credit appetite in
sponsored specialty. And so a little bit of the mutation, if you will, in the expansion of yield had to do with the loan
mix in the fourth quarter as much as anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then my second one, you'd mentioned intangibles tied to Ametros. And I was curious, what is
the breakdown or the types of intangibles? And if it's CDI, what is the amortization methodology and timeframe to
recapture that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a great question. And we're still working through the intangibles on that. We haven't closed on it yet. But
it's a little different than the typical banking type of transaction and that these have a life somewhere in excess of
20 years. So you would expect the intangible amortization to be using the bank – in the bank space, it's the
maximum 10 years. But in this case, I think it would probably be further out than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
But it's safe to assume it's a CDI versus goodwill?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, primarily, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, John. Hey, Glenn. Maybe a question on capital. You basically said that you're going to pause on the
buybacks for a bit until you build a little bit more post-Ametros. I guess, two-part question, what's your best
estimate for pro forma CET1 for the deal? And then anything precluding you from resuming buybacks maybe Q2,
Q3?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So thanks, Chris. And what I said was that in the near term. And so I think that you can think about
Common Equity Tier 1 coming right about down to our target level of 10.5% in the first quarter and then we'd
begin to build capital from that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's exactly right, Chris. And I think we clearly have in our plan and our expectations, if there are no other
productive uses of organic capital, that we will look at dividend and repurchases in the latter half of the year,
maybe the second, third and fourth quarter over time. We generally repurchased shares to offset grants to
employees as well and we'll continue to do that.
So it's still part of our game plan. We're just being, I think, a little bit cautious and prudent as we look at our capital
levels through the Ametros closing. We also potentially have opportunities in balance sheet and securities
repositioning that could go into that bucket of decisions as well, but we anticipate returning capital to shareholders
over the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then maybe one on the NII guide. I think you've got an outlook that looks more similar to ours, which
has a little bit fewer cuts in the futures market. If we were to get the six cut, five, six cuts by 2024, how would your
NII outlook change from what you provided?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think if we got six cuts and we have four cuts in there now, it would probably – it's not really that significant to
us. We do have some hedges that would kick in, but I think it's probably in the range, just to give you a ballpark, of
$15 million to $20 million downside. So it's not that significant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And that $15 million to $20 million is for 2024 given the cadence [indiscernible] (00:25:30)?

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Morning. So, Glenn, just following up on another one on the NII guide. So looking at slide 11, giving us the
cumulative beta in the first quarter to 41%, I was wondering if you could give us the progression throughout the
year. Where does that cumulative beta peak in the tightening cycle? And then how does it progress after you get
these four cuts beginning in May?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think it will be – Casey, I think it will stay around that 41%, plus or minus. I think the dynamic there is
going to be our deposit repricing. And so if you look at our book of $60 billion, about 20% or, say, $12 million of
that book is what I would characterize as high beta, no lag type of deposits. So those – is the Fed – and think of
Ametros, perfect example, almost $6 billion.

Glenn I. MacInnes A

I'm sorry, interLINK. I'm getting ahead of – interLINK, say, $6 billion, right? And so that would reprice one on one
with Fed funds and it would be immediate. So that's an example of a high beta, no lag type of deposit. So when I
look at our deposit book, it's about 20%. So I'd say $12 billion to $13 billion of our $60 billion. So that'll be a
benefit for us. So I think it'll probably end up around – we're at 41%, plus or minus, somewhere around there.
The other factor you have is that our down deposit beta is probably going to run on a full-year basis in the mid-
20s, right? So that'll help offset some of it as well.

Got you. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And Ametros – I did bring up Ametros. That will lower our beta because obviously we're bringing in $800 million at
a few basis points, and that's expected to grow by 25% a year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just – yeah, just following up on – so the fee and expense guide implies a decent ramp
from the current run rate. I know obviously Ametros is on the come here. Just wondering, can you break out what
is organic or what is legacy Webster and then what does Ametros add? Just so we can get a better feel for
ramps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me take a run at it, and then John can add some color. So core expenses were $1.2 billion, say, in
2023. And as you saw the guidance, $1.3 billion to $1.325 billion in 2024. So round numbers, that represents
growth of like $100 million to $125 million. And if you peel that back, I would say approximately $50 million is tied
to Ametros. So that includes operating costs associated with 150 employees, the technology platform along with
the intangible amortization.
And about half of the remains, that's $50 million. And about half the remains is tied to performance-based comp,
right? So $20 million, say, tied to performance-based comp and then another $40 million tied to investment in
revenue-generating type of business lines. So you got $40 million from performance-based comp, another – or
$20 million from performance-based comp, $40 million from investments in the business, and then $50 million on
Ametros in very broad numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And then the fees, he asked.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Oh, and then fees. Okay. So on NII, so our non-interest – yeah, non-interest income. Sorry. So core non-interest
income, $348 million for 2023. We're projecting $375 million to $400 million. So you got $25 million to $50 million
in year-over-year growth and about $25 million that's tied to Ametros, right, which is the mix of account
administration fees, pharmacy and other transactional sort of rebate type of fees.
The remaining growth is sort of, of course, a number of categories like HAS interchange up $4 million to $5
million; commercial lending fees which include swaps, syndication and transactional type of fees, $3 million to $5
million; trust investment fees; some smaller cash management fees. So that gives you that sort of geography of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And, Casey, to put a finer point on expenses, right, it looks like a high headline number. But to Glenn's point, half
of the increase in the guided expenses really are related to Ametros acquisition. And of those expenses, as Glenn
said, part of it is OpEx and part of it is the amortization of intangibles. And then you have performance-based
compensation year-over-year, an increase in expectation, which most of the industry is seeing.
If you then look down, the remaining increase in core expenses is about 4% or slightly under. And that has some
investment in teams and people and projects and technology. Even if we execute all of those things with our
range of expectations, we're still going to be in the low- to mid-40% from an efficiency perspective, which I think is
unique for us, giving us the opportunity to be on offense and to continue to invest into the kind of revenue
tailwinds and the rate decline.
And obviously, we have opportunities should the tailwinds with respect to NII or fees get higher than we expect to
curtail on the timing on some of those investments and lower expenses if we need to. So I feel pretty good about
where we are ending up at those financial metrics we promised over time, given the guidance we've given. And I
think the headline number on the expense is really neat. So you kind of peel it back and realize that half of it is not
organic, it's the acquisition, and the rest of it is kind of performance-based and investment in new revenue
opportunities.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Can you talk about the guidance for the 5% to 7% loan growth in 2024? Where do you see that growth coming
from? And I guess, what do you view as a catalyst, right? Like how much help do you need from the environments
to get to that now high end of that range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's a great question. And obviously, we realize that the 5% to 7% guide is kind of on the top end of
what you're seeing in the market. And the good news from our vantage point is we hope that we've got a good
finger on the pulse of our pipeline and our clients and the markets and the sectors we serve.
So what I would say is we're not projecting that with a hope-and-pray attitude that the market conditions improve.
We're understanding our original assumptions going in were that we would have higher loan growth than that. And
so I really do think we've got a lot of opportunity. We've gone through our pipelines in commercial. The majority of
the originations in the loan growth will come in those commercial categories, which will be non-office CRE,
commercial public sector finance, sponsor and specialty, general C&I end market and fund banking. Those are
the areas we obviously have good equipment finance and ABL capabilities, too. But I would say those core
commercial categories where the growth is.
And the other finer point, in talking to our Head of Commercial Banking and looking at our pipeline going forward
and the momentum we had at the end of the quarter in terms of booking, is that you're seeing – while you may not
see overall loan demand starting to flourish, obviously, it's still a bit muted. In some of the transactional areas,
we're starting to see more trading of assets and more transactional activity. And for us, for Webster, in our unique
businesses, that means real estate investors, private equity sponsors who are starting to see more activity in
terms of buying and selling assets or buying and selling companies. And that's why we've seen our pipeline grow
significantly as we head into the first quarter.
We'll obviously keep people updated as we go quarter to quarter, but right now we've got a good level of
confidence that that 5% bogey on the low end of the range is something that's attainable without taking too much
risk and continuing to execute kind of within our underwriting boxes and with our existing strategies around
segments and geography.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Very helpful. And then if you can speak a little bit about the credit side, especially on commercial credit, I know
there was a smaller increase this quarter on the commercial classified loan bucket. But if you can expand on what
you're seeing there and if you could dig in a little bit on what you're seeing in non-office CRE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. We're not really seeing any degradation in non-office – I'll start with your last question – in non-office CRE,
and we seem to be managing maturities well, and sponsors and owners seem to be connected to their loans. So I
wouldn't know any significant deterioration there at all. I think the way I characterize the quarter from a credit
perspective is being relatively unchanged from prior quarter is pretty accurate. We had a few loans in C&I go into
classifieds. We also reduced our nonperformers modestly, so we kind of had some offsets there, and the overall
credit profile remains stable.

We're not seeing any – and again, I haven't dealt with you a lot, but many know that I was the Chief Credit Risk
Officer during the Great Recession and thereafter. I have been surprised like many of us that there's been no
capitulation in certain areas, right? And we're still seeing significant resiliency in the consumer. We have no
issues at all in our home equity and mortgage loans with respect to delinquencies or issues.
And in C&I, people have been pretty resilient and we're seeing some level of investment. The areas that we still
focus on, I would say, in sponsoring specialty healthcare services, those are sort of secular pressures, contracting
which generally is cyclical. But we've done a good job proactively, either avoiding certain sectors and certain
opportunities or being able to remediate things quickly. And then obviously you've seen us reduce our office
exposure, geez, by almost $700 million over the course of the last five or six quarters without material loss. So I
think the overall net risk rating migration in the portfolio continues to be modestly to the downside. But with
proactive risk management and working through things, we're not seeing any material areas of stress in the
portfolio.
Even if you look at the charge-off numbers, I think for the year we ended up at about 22 basis points.
Interestingly, that's kind of the same as the five-year average pre-pandemic. So you're really – that gives you a
perspective of where credit performance is now even to pre-pandemic levels. And within that 22 basis points, 10
basis points of the 22 basis points is related to proactive balance sheet management and loan sales. So we really
haven't seen kind of a credit wave that I think people have been expecting for time, but we continue to monitor
pretty aggressively.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

be intangible amortization.

I want to just go back to the margin for you, Glenn. So the NIM at 3.42% is fairly strong, right? Many of your peers
are in the 2% club. As we think about the potential for Fed cuts, right, which is a short-term negative given an
asset-sensitive balance sheet, but long-term positive given the potential for a steeper curve, put this together for
us. Like how do we think the NIM – does the NIM trend up in the early part of 2024 and then down once we start
getting those cuts? And then once we do get a normal curve, how do you think about a normal NIM first where
you are in 4Q%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, yeah. Thanks, Steve. So I think the 3.2% (sic) [3.42%] is sort of more of an anomaly for us, given the
originations that occurred. John, I think, highlighted in his remarks, over $1 billion of loan origination, securities
originations at the end of the quarter. So we'll get the full benefit of that as we get into the first quarter. And then if
you add things like Ametros and you just think of it like mathematically, $800 million is coming in. At a minimum,
we're going to pay down FHLB borrowings that are 5%, 5.25%, right? So you get the immediate benefit of that.
That will carry out through the whole year, so that will support our NIM.
The other thing, and I know we've talked about this in the past, is we continue to have this dynamic, as I think all
do, that fixed rate loans are repricing. So for us, it's like $1 billion, $1.2 billion at some quarters of fixed rate loans
that are repricing. And to the extent they reprice the fixed rate loans, you're picking up 200 basis points. So that's
added to NIM as well.
The securities purchases, like we talked about at the end of the quarter, you get the full-year benefit of that. When
you think about the restructuring we did on $400 million, we probably picked up about 400 basis points on that.
These are all additive to them. And I think what's – the dynamic here is that you're seeing NIM supported in the
first couple of quarters and it will carry out through the year. You'll see – we are asset sensitive. So in the back
17

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
half of the year, as the Fed starts to cut, you'll see deposit costs begin to – what will initially be a lag will begin to
reprice down as well.
So all that ins and outs and there's a lot of moving pieces, as I'm sure you can appreciate, I would expect that the
NIM would be in the range of 3.45% with some potential upside, depending on how the balance sheet rolls out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And, Steve, I think you have the dynamic right, right? We get some opportunity in the near term, a little
more pressure in the long term this year when they start cutting. But as Glenn said, we feel pretty confident given
the moves we've made that we can keep that NIM relatively stable at a rate better than most of the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on HSA Bank, which had a decent year overall for 2023. So as you guys
know, there's quite a bit of speculation since the last earnings call in terms of your appetite to retain the business.
John, can you frame for us how you look at HSA Bank today, right? I looked at the slide 4 and I say, well, maybe
it's not as important as it used to be to the franchise. Do you feel that the value of HSA Bank is being held back by
being inside of Webster? Can you give me your update there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I don't, so I'll answer the question in kind of short term. And it's every bit as important to us as it's been.
Obviously, from a pure financial contribution perspective, given the size of the organization now, it's a slightly
smaller contributor but nonetheless hugely important to us from a revenue and fee and obviously low cost loan
duration deposit perspective.
I can clarify on this call, because I knew there was a lot of activity and speculation after our last phone call, I
answered that question the way I had answered it every single quarter. When asked what happened, Steve, was
that no one asked the question for about six quarters. So people thought because I gave an answer that there
was a new perspective.
No, we are not a seller of HSA. We are a true believer, particularly with the acquisition of the Ametros, in our
ability, unique ability as a bank to have diversified funding sources that grow fees at a good clip. And I think we'll
be able to – and not included in our forecast, as I mentioned, are opportunities for us to have cross synergies in
some of these really unique businesses, even throw interLINK in there as well.
But I also do say very carefully every time that we're a steward of our shareholders' capital. And so we continually
have to evaluate all of our business lines, how we can maximize economic profit in those business lines, and
whether or not that happens as a wholly-owned activity or as a joint venture activity or as a sold activity.
And so our premise is we're not a seller of HSA, but obviously we're always doing diligence to make sure that
we're not missing an opportunity to achieve the best value for our shareholders as we allocate capital and make
those decisions.

Got it. That's helpful color. John, if I could squeeze one more and violate your two-question rule. So just regarding
this $100 billion potential threshold, so you guys ended the year at $75 billion. And when we look at some of your
peers in the similar asset range, a lot of them are on an RWA diet, right? But when you look at your 2024
guidance, you guys seem to want to be at the buffet.
So when you look at that, do you see no reason to slow growth? Like you feel like you're very prepared, those
rules could change. But that's no reason to slow your growth in terms of trying to manage the timeline to get there.
Just what gives you so much more confidence than some of your peers? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's a loaded question. I mean, I think that – look, I think we have a ways to go before we hit the
threshold. As you can imagine, we're spending a lot of time looking at our three- and five-year plans, making sure
that we're prepared from a compliance and risk management perspective, making sure we understand the full
impact of the rules if they ultimately are enacted on capital, on liquidity, on the makeup of our balance sheet.
Steve, I think we've got enough flexibility in the asset classes that we grow. We can make economic moves to
divest or to slow growth quickly. And we're not up against the gun with respect to looking at this over the next 18
to 24 months. I think we still have some running room to service customers, to take care of our existing clients
and continue to plan for the eventuality of $100 billion.
And so we don't think that it's time to pull back and slow growth now. But every move we're making and
everything we're doing strategically, we obviously have an eye toward what does that mean when you overlay the
$100 billion requirement. So I know that may not be a satisfying answer, but know that we're thinking about it.
We're thinking about what it means for our future view on M&A.
Do you want to crawl over $100 billion, do you want to avoid it, do you want to jump well over $100 billion? Those
are the discussions we're having. And we're positioning ourselves, quite frankly, because of the uncertainty in the
market to be able to take advantage of any one of those strategies if it's the right strategy at the time. So I don't
think we're putting ourselves in a trapped position by continuing to use our differentiated funding base and
origination channels to continue to grow at this pace. I don't think we are.

Hey, Glenn, I just wanted to follow up on the securities purchases and restructure with a couple of questions. The
purchase yield was 6.79% this quarter. So, one, what are you buying? And then, two, just given the end-of-

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. So, first, on the question that we sold, like I said, $408 million. I think the yield on that was like 128 basis
points. Most of what we bought really during the quarter was NDS and within, say, a 3.8-year duration and a book
yield of, say, 5.80%, 5.85%, 5.88%. Does that answer that part?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Got it. And then just for my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on Ametros again. Thank you for kind of talking
about the CDI expense, but I wanted to ask just the 25% CAGR. On the surface, it seems like a pretty aggressive
kind of growth target just given we're banking analysts. But I was hoping maybe you could discuss – maybe
setting the synergies aside, why you think that's the appropriate kind of growth target. And are the areas of
conservatism within that guidance where you could kind of outperform it organically even without synergies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Remember, it's off a pretty small base and we've got historic data and there's a great management team
there and a great team and they've demonstrated the ability to do it. As I noted, there really is a pretty strong
pipeline. You can see the natural growth. It's kind of like HSA. It gets very predictable and it's also like HSA a little
bit in that they had great relationships with both their account holders and the insurance companies that they do
work for. And so we've got pretty good line of sight to growth off a relatively small base going forward. And you've
got kind of – a bunch of that is contractor future payments, so you kind of know what's coming in. So I think we
feel pretty comfortable that that's kind of a reasonable range.
Where we see the upside, I mentioned it in my comments, we don't factor in right now any other expansion into
different product sets with similar characteristics. And I know the CEO there who's really talented have good line
of sight with capital investment behind him to be able to expand the markets that they serve.
We don't factor in any synergies between account holders in some of our other businesses and cross-sell
opportunities. So the upside is really our opportunity to figure out new ways for them to do it. But in terms of our
baseline, 25% CAGR growth, we feel very confident that that's kind of a very predictable, strong line of sight to
that growth over the next five years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And if I could sneak one more in, just given the strength of the business on a standalone basis, I know it's
smaller for you guys. But just given the pipeline, given the growth outlook, why did Long Ridge think it was the
right time for them to sell? Just because it seems like there's going to be a lot of strength in that business line
going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. There's no story there at all. It's just a natural private equity investment, and it was time for them to divest.
We knew the company through our relationships with sponsor and specialty. And it wasn't an auction process. We
were able to convince the team and the sellers that we were the right buyer. And it was a very smooth
transaction. So there's no story there, and that's it.

Yeah. Most of the originations were driven in the quarter by core C&I. But in particular, fund banking, very low risk
and lower yielding, quite frankly. But obviously, we believe it's still economically profitable loan growth along with
some high quality multifamily and some public sector finance, which is kind of our national government banking.
Again, all of those assets, higher quality than the overall portfolio on a risk-rated basis, slightly lower yielding,
which was why we gave the answer to the question earlier about lower than expected yield expansion in the
quarter. And again, particularly in the fund banking side, much of that closed by year-end. And so we were kind of
working through our pipeline and that's why things closed in December as opposed to closing earlier in the
quarter.

Okay, okay. Just a second question, bigger picture, John. It seems like the Sterling merger has gone well. It
seems like you and Jack have been on the same page. But any new priorities for you as Chairman? I'm assuming
it's business as usual, but thought I would ask as long as you mentioned it.

No, we're completely aligned and we'll continue to be. And obviously, I'll continue to seek out his counsel even
after he's left the organization. But, no, there's no pivot at all. We spend a lot of time, the entire team,
management team and board, making sure that kind of we knew what the North Star was and what we were
trying to build. And we're still on that journey.
We still have opportunities. We think we've got good line of sight to continue to deliver a 20%-ish ROATC or
1.4%-ish ROA, and a leading efficiency ratio to give us flexibility to grow. And I think all the things we're doing are
the things we thought we would do. Obviously, the environment has been a little bit volatile over time, but there'll
be no pivot in culture, strategy or other things. You'll see us continue to try and execute at a high level.

ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Good morning. Maybe just staying on Sterling. With integration now past you, there's been these
discussions of the opportunities to enhance some of the areas in fee income across commercial consumer, as
you say. You talked about treasury, cash management, card, FX as areas of growth. But can you provide any size
priming of these opportunities if possible? What could be implied in your guide for 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, as you know, on the cash management, card, FX and some of the other ancillary businesses, we
do have built in, as Glenn mentioned, into our increase in fees relatively good double-digit growth in those off of a
relatively small base compared to our NII. And the truth of the matter is that those activities are not going to
materially change the outcome of our steady growth, right?
So we're working on those things. We've already rolled out new capabilities for our clients. Things like Ametros
move the needle a little bit in terms of Glenn talked to you about the contribution in expected fees in the year, and
so that's going to be good.
We keep looking at interesting opportunities and not built into our forecast and definitely too early to talk about.
But opportunities around capital markets, around syndicating, around securitization, like are there opportunities
given our strong origination capabilities to generate fee income and further have other options to manage the
balance sheet. But those are things we think about to drive fee income over the long term, but nothing in our
plans right now and nothing that I would be comfortable giving you guidance on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. I think last quarter, maybe just talking about the expenses, the expense opportunities that still
remain. I think you talked about consolidation of sub-ledgers, back office processes and call center consolidation.
Maybe could you help frame any of the remaining opportunity on this front?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think Glenn might comment, but I think that's sort of built into our overall net expense view. Some of the
stuff is a little stickier than others. We've made progress on consolidation of the call centers. We have opportunity
there. We still need to decommission some old noncore technology that in the transition stays. But I would say, it's
an offset to the investments that we think we're going to make in future technology. And so I don't know if you get
an estimate for what you think the full run rate of some of those opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
I would just come back to mid- to low-40% efficiency ratio. And that's where we expect to be. And so what that
implies is it gives us, first of all, optionality to the extent there's more market headwinds. So we have some
optionality there.
But I also think the more important point is, is that we are still getting. I know as a CFO in my world, we're still
consolidating ledgers and there's implications down to reconciliations and stuff like that. But that gives us an
opportunity to reinvest in the business as well. So I think we like to think of it as we're best in class at 45% – at
low- to mid-40s on the efficiency ratio. And so I would just use – if you're thinking of modeling it, that's what I
would use as a guide.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. I was curious...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey. Good morning and welcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Appreciate it. Yeah. If we could just think about just the deposit franchise in general. I think when Casey asked
the question, you gave some deposit beta assumptions on your different niches. I was just curious, if the forward
curve is correct or even just the forecast assumption, are there any flow differences or what you might see in a
deposit mix in general? I guess that's down 100 basis points in a non-recessionary environment and is kind of
24


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
unprecedented. But just kind of just your thoughts on what that deposit mix might look like or how flows might
change over the course of those 100-ish bps going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a good question. So there's a couple of things that I think are unique to us. And obviously, we talked a
lot about Ametros. We do have the benefit of HSA as well where we get the enrollment period in the first quarter.
And then we continue to get those accounts funded during the year. We have interLINK, which gives us
optionality from the ability to increase core deposits or to the extent we have, we're satisfied with our loan-to-
deposit ratio to lay some of those off. So that gives us optionality as well.
I think the thing that we're watching is, as far as the flow of deposits, we do have maturities on CDs coming due,
about $2 billion in the first quarter, another just under that in the second quarter. So that's something that we're
keeping a close eye on, on how that rolls over. And we're also keeping an eye on things like demand or pure
DDA, which has come down a little bit. So we're basically – we've been hovering around that $11 billion mark. We
think that probably has potential to grow about $200 million over the course of the year.
So those are the sort of things that we're thinking. I don't see anything significant. I think you'll still see a little bit
more of deposit flow from low interest-bearing type of money market and savings account into CDs to the extent
people or our clients think that rates are going to drop. They might want to go a little longer on their investments
and things like that. We have continued to see that. But I think those are very basic dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I would agree with Glenn. And I think, I hope we're answering the question you're asking, which is the first
100 points down. I don't think it changes necessarily behaviors by customers and depositors or kind of overall
bank, non-bank deposit flows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you, yeah. That's really helpful. And then just from a follow-up, just to play a little bit of devil's advocate here. I
know that you said that the forward curve is correct. There's kind of the six-ish cuts. You probably have a little bit
of downside relative to that NII range, which in reality probably put your revenue at the floor, maybe a little bit
below the combined range today. And I know you said you had flexibility on expenses. Could you also put
expenses overall below the $1.3 billion or is that kind of the floor in terms of investment and we just expect a
slightly higher purchase ratio for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Boy, interesting question. No, I mean, I think we always have optionality, right? Because some of it is project
based and investment based. And if the market conditions change and are more dramatic than that, the projected
performance-based incentive comp cutting line comes down naturally.
So there's – we can clearly go below the $1.3 billion if the overall environment demanded us to do that. But I
would say, again, kind of dramatically that we believe we have the opportunity to invest. And even at those
expense levels, we'll still have the most efficient operating model in the top 25 banks. And so, yes, we do have
25

flexibility. There are some variable costs in there and some project-based investments that we could either delay
or cancel or pull back on if we had to.

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q

Great. Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Just going back to Ametros here, can you help us think what the pro forma intangibles will look like? And also, just
maybe fine tune a little bit when the closing date is expected in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So on the pro forma, I think you can think of it as a spring in an $800 million immediately in deposits, and the
immediate action would be dependent on FHLB, and so call out 5% to 5.25% in the quarter, right, percent on
those. And then it would eventually or quickly move into funding loans, which you heard me say earlier are more
in the range of like 7.50% – 7.5%. I talked about the fee income being $25 million and I talked about the expenses
in the range of $50 million with half of that being CDI. So I think you can build the P&L pretty quickly.
The thing I would point out is John and we talked earlier is that this is a business that's going to grow at 25%
CAGR every year. So we're bringing in $800 million, good chance we'll be closer to the $1 billion range by the end
of this year. And that will continue based on contractual relationships and everything you see in the market. So
that should allow you to build your sort of P&L.

And pro forma intangibles shift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, yeah. Of the intangibles, of the $50 million expense, I think it's about half of that. And then relatively soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
End of Jan – okay. So just on the pro forma intangible figure, $2.835 billion grows by about $25 million. That's it?
Did I hear that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
I'm not sure. Say that again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
So your $2.835 billion that you have in total intangibles on your balance sheet, your goodwill and other intangible
assets, that grows by $25 million with this acquisition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

So the intangible amortization is about $25 million in the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

We are not complete on that. I'm estimating that right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got you. Makes sense. And then just going back to office, what were the office charge-offs in the fourth quarter?
And if you have it, what were the office charge-offs for your full-year 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Let me see if I can get that for you, Laurie. They weren't meaningful in this quarter. I think charges, including all
the proactive note sales, were roughly in the $25 million to $30 million range for the entire year. And that includes
all of, as I said, the proactive note sales. So not sort of fully mature charge-offs. I mean, there are losses
nonetheless. And I think it wasn't particularly a meaningful contribution to this quarter's charge-offs. I'm still
looking for the number, I apologize.
But as I said, we're getting to the point where that book – we feel pretty confident around kind of what's left and
the credit support we have underlying in. We feel really good about how aggressive which we've brought down
that exposure.

Yeah. It's obviously – they're the market leader, but there's a huge untapped – I think it's $12 billion in total claims
in their space right now. So there's a lot of running room. It's early days. And their value proposition, I think, is
starting to be realized by more of the insurers and more account holders in the industry. So it's very low
penetrated from a professional administrative perspective, which is one of the things that we think is so exciting
about the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. And is there a risk that maybe some of that competition eats into your growth rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Again, given the total addressable market and the good penetration that these guys have with respect to
customer base, I think a lot of it is contractual. And so I think at least in terms of our projections now, we don't see
any risk from cannibalization from competitors. And it's our opportunity, I think, to be a first mover across the
industry and to continue to expand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then my follow-up, just looking at New York City multifamily, can you give us the breakdown of rent
regulated versus market rate properties and to the extent you have any exposure to pre-2019 HSTPA real
change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Very little exposure to pre-2019. I would say about, let's see, after the – more than half of our loans are
booked after the regulation. Multifamily – $1.35 billion in 4Q of rent regulated multifamily, down from the third Q
level of $1.4 billion. This is an interesting stat for you that the portfolio is obviously diversified, but the average
commitment is $3.2 million.
We only have seven loans with exposures over $15 million there. So very granular and non-chunky portfolio with
no tall trees, which I think makes us feel pretty comfortable. And criticized classified loans are kind of below the
overall credit stats of the rest of the commercial book, and so there's only one delinquent loan right now in that
$1.35 billion. So we don't see any credit story there right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
