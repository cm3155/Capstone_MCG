I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President and CEO.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB's fourth quarter net income available to
common shareholders was $49 million on a reported basis and a $139 million on an operating basis. Full year
2023's operating performance was highlighted by record revenue of $1.6 billion, record net income available to
common shareholders of $569 million and record earnings per diluted common share of $1.50.
Tangible book value per share has increased 15% year-over-year to a record high of $9.47 per share, steadily
approaching a $10 milestone. Since 2009, FNB's internal capital generation representing tangible book value and
dividends has been strong, with 10% compounded annual growth. With this strong profitability, full-year positive
operating leverage totaled 1.5% and is expected to remain in the upper quartile on a peer-relative basis.
FNB's exceptional financial performance in 2023 is a direct result of the consistent execution of our strategic
initiatives. The banking disruption in the first quarter of the year placed a spotlight on the importance of balance
sheet resilience, including our deposit base, strong capital and liquidity position and prudent underwriting
standards. It also reinforced the value of our quality customer relationships and comprehensive delivery teams.
These attributes have always been integral to FNB's long-term strategy, which has been proven through multiple
cycles over the last decade and are ingrained in the foundation upon which FNB operates.
Our commitment to maintain a stable deposit base is evident in our total deposits, which ended the year at $34.7
billion, unchanged from the prior year, even with the elevated competition for customer deposits. The noninterest-
bearing deposit to total deposit mix ended the year at 29.4%. While we have seen customer migration away from
noninterest-bearing deposits, we continued to substantially outperform our peers and the industry in our total
deposit cost and overall cost of funds. Our spot deposit costs ended the year below 2% and is over 50 basis
points better than our peers in the third quarter.
Our better than peer funding cost and strong liquidity provide balance sheet optionality. Our tangible common
equity to tangible assets of 7.8% is the highest level in the company history. It exceeds the [indiscernible]
(00:04:49). FNB remains committed to optimally deploy capital in a manner that is fully aligned with our
shareholders interest and best positions FNB for future success.
As part of that commitment, FNB recently completed the sale of approximately $650 million of available for sale
securities, announced a redemption of $110 million of preferred stock and transferred $355 million of indirect auto
loans to held-for-sale, with the sale expected to close in the first quarter. Together, these actions resulted in a
capital neutral transaction that improves forward returns and earnings with expected EPS accretion in the low-
single digits. Our continued ability to meet our clients' needs is critical to our performance. FNB has continually
made strategic investments in our delivery team to deepen customer relationships, gain market share and further
outpace our competitors.
In June 2023, we introduced the eStore Common application where majority of our consumer loan products and
recently introduced deposit products in December, allowing customers to apply for up to 18 consumer deposit and
loan products simultaneously. Our goal for 2024 is to bring small businesses into the fold with business loans,
deposits and payments included in the common application on the eStore. These additional features further
enhance the customer experience and deepen product penetration, as customers can apply for multiple loan and

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
deposit products simultaneously in a very streamlined manner, eliminating keystrokes, providing a portal to
upload supporting documents and automating account funding.
We also made significant enhancements in our physical delivery channel in 2023. In addition to expanding our
footprint with four de novo locations, we entered into a partnership with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
that establishes FNB as the sole ATM provider with the third largest heavy rail system in the United States. With
ATM banking services in every metro station, the partnership will add more than a 120 machines to FNB's
Network in 2024. Our physical delivery channel is approaching 2,000 combined branches, ATMs and interactive
television. Paired with our Digital eStore FNB has significantly enhanced access for our current and future
customers for augmenting brand awareness across our footprint.
With the success of our eStore and our exceptional bankers, total loans and leases ended the year at a record
$32.8 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion since year-end 2022. We are beginning the year from a strong position.
Will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment with market-specific trends to manage risk
proactively as part of our core credit philosophy. We will remain steadfast in our approach to consistent
underwriting and risk management to maintain a balanced, well-positioned portfolio throughout the economic
cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to provide additional information on the fourth quarter's credit performance.

Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter and year-end period with our asset quality
metrics remaining at solid levels. Total delinquency finished the year at 70 basis points, seasonally up 7 basis
points from the end of September and down 1 basis point from the prior year-end period. NPLs and OREA
decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter and 5 bps from the year-ago period to end at a very good level at
34 bps. Criticized loans were down 13 basis points compared to both the prior quarter and year end. But net
charge-offs for the quarter and full-year at 10 basis points and 22 basis points, respectively.
I'll conclude my remarks with an update on our credit risk management strategies and CRE portfolio. Total
provision expense for the quarter stood at $13.2 million, providing for loan growth and charge-offs. Additionally,
provision expense had a positive benefit from a reduction in criticized loans and NPLs. Our ending funded reserve
increased $4.9 million in the quarter and stands at $406 million or a solid 1.25% of loans, reflecting our strong
position relative to our peers.
When including acquired unamortized loan discount our reserve stands at 1.39% and our NPL coverage position
remains strong at 418%, inclusive of the unamortized loan discounts. We remain committed to consistent
underwriting and credit risk management to maintain a balanced, well-positioned portfolio throughout the
economic cycles. Each quarter we performed specific in-depth reviews of our portfolios in addition to ongoing full
portfolio stress tests. Our stress testing results for this quarter have shown lower forecasted net charge-offs and
stable provision compared to the prior quarter's results, again, confirming that our diversified loan portfolio
enables us to withstand various economic downturn scenarios.
Regarding the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio, in 2023, we were successful in addressing maturities and the
impact of the rising rate environment on the portfolio. In 2024, we will continue with the same strategy, monitoring
the rate environment and proactively addressing upcoming maturities. At year-end delinquency and NPLs for the
4

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
non-owner occupied CRE portfolio continued to remain very low at 32 basis points and 18 basis points,
respectively, which confirms our consistent underwriting and strong sponsorship.
In closing, asset quality metrics ended the year at very good levels and we are well positioned going into 2024.
We continue to generate diversified loan growth in attractive markets, in a competitive environment for high-
quality borrowers, while maintaining our consistent underwriting standards. We closely monitor macroeconomic
trends and the individual markets in our footprint and we'll continue to manage risk aggressively, while
maintaining a consistent credit profile across all of our portfolios.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Now I will focus on the fourth quarter's financial results, provide additional detail
on the recent actions taken to further optimize our balance sheet, and offer guidance for 2024.
Fourth quarter operating net income available to common shareholders totaled $139 million or $0.38 per share,
excluding $114 million of significant items impacting earnings. On a full-year basis, operating earnings totaled a
record $1.57 per share, and tangible book value totaled $9.47, 15% increase from December 2022.
Part of our ongoing proactive balance sheet management strategy, we took several actions to enhance future
profitability and capital positioning. Late in the fourth quarter, we sold approximately $650 million of available for
sale investment securities, transferred $355 million of indirect auto loans to held-for-sale, and announced the
redemption of $110 million of the Series E preferred stock that was issued 10 years ago. The cumulative impact
of these balance sheet actions generates incremental earnings, and has the tangible book value earn back period
of less than one year versus an earn back of five years for stock buyback while retaining capital flexibility in 2024.
The sale of investment securities resulted in a realized loss of $67.4 million in the fourth quarter, as we sold
securities yielding 1.08% on average and reinvested the proceeds into securities that yields approximately 350
basis points higher with similar duration and convexity profiles.
We recorded a $16.7 million negative fair value mark in other noninterest expense and the indirect auto loans
classified as held-for-sale at December 31, reflecting changes in interest rates from the time of origination. The
sale of these loans is expected to close during the first quarter, with the proceeds being used to repay borrowings
that have a similar yield to the sold loans. Our year-end loan-to-deposit ratio benefited by approximately 100 basis
points.
Excluding the $355 million of held-for-sale indirect auto loans, underlying period-end loan growth was 8% since
year-end 2022. Fourth quarter loan production reflected high-quality loans across our diverse footprint with
quarterly commercial loan growth of $351 million and consumer loan growth of $178 million.
Investment portfolio remained essentially flat linked quarter at $7.2 billion inclusive of the securities portfolio
restructuring. There remains a fairly even split between AFS and HTM, with 45% in available for sale at the end of
the year. The duration of our securities portfolio at December 31 is 4.2 years, similar to last quarter.
Total deposits ended the year at $34.7 billion, a slight increase of $96 million linked quarter. As of December 31,
noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 29.4% of total deposits, compared to 30.9% at September 30. Given our
granular, stable deposit base, we believe we will continue to outperform the industry with a favorable mix of
5

(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits and lower deposit costs, which meaningfully outperform the peers
as our team remains actively focused on managing deposit mix. With our spot deposit costs, ending the year at
$1.93, our cumulative deposit beta totaled 34.3%, in line with our expectations discussed last quarter.
Fourth quarter's net interest margin was 3.21%, a decline of only 5 basis points, which is better than our
expectations discussed last quarter. The yield on earning assets increased 14 basis points to 5.25% due to higher
yields on both loans and investment securities. Total cost of funds increased 21 basis points to 2.14%, as the cost
of interest-bearing deposits increased 29 basis points to 2.65%. Net interest income totaled $324 million, a slight
decrease of $2.6 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to noninterest income and expense. Operating noninterest income totaled $80.4 million and adjusting for
the $67.4 million realized loss on the investment securities restructuring. Mortgage banking operations income
increased $3.1 million linked quarter due to improved gain on sale margins, aided by the decline in mortgage
rates in the fourth quarter. Other noninterest income declined $2.4 million and small business investment
company fund income decreased, reflecting normal fluctuations based on the performance of the underlying
portfolio companies.
Additionally, we broke out our service charges fee income line on the income statement into service charges and
a new line item for interchange and card transaction fees, which was previously captured in the service charge
line. This will create better transparency into our various revenue streams in noninterest income. Operating
noninterest expense of $218.9 million was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter when adjusting for the
fair value mark on the held-for-sale, indirect auto loans of $16.7 million and a $29.9 million FDIC special
assessment related to replenishment of the Deposit Insurance Fund for the Bank failures.
The linked quarter increase in outside services of $2.4 million reflects higher third-party costs. Bank shares and
franchise taxes declined $2.3 million, reflecting charitable contributions that qualify for Pennsylvania Bank shares
tax credits. And marketing expenses decreased $1.2 million due to the timing of digital marketing campaigns in
the third quarter.
The fourth quarter efficiency ratio of 52.5% continues to be in the top quartile of our peers. Efficiency ratio of
51.2% on a full-year basis demonstrates our commitment to effectively managing costs while growing our diverse
revenue streams.
We ended the year with our capital ratios some of the strongest levels in recent history. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1%,
which includes the impact of the previously discussed balance sheet management items and the FDIC special
assessment, remains above our stated operating target. Tangible common equity totaled 7.8% and when
excluding the 54-basis-point impact of AOCI would equal 8.3%.
Tangible book value per common share was $9.47 at December 31, an increase of $0.45 per share from
September 30. AOCI reduced the tangible book value per common share by $0.65 as of year-end compared to
$1.06 last quarter, primarily due to the impact of interest rates on the fair value of available for sale securities.
Because the investment securities that were sold in December were in available for sale, the realized loss did not
incrementally impact TCE or tangible book value, since the market value is already reflected in AOCI.
Let's now look at the 2024 guidance for both the first quarter and the full-year, starting with the balance sheet. On
a full-year spot basis, we expect loans to grow mid-single digits as we continue to increase our market share
across our diverse geographic footprint. Total projected deposit balances are expected to grow low-single digits
on a year-over-year spot basis. Full year net interest income is expected to be between $1.295 billion and $1.345
6

billion, with the first quarter of 2024 between $318 million and $328 million. Our guidance assumes 325 basis
point rate cuts aligning with the Fed stoploss which we are projecting to occur in May, July and November 2024.
Non-interest income is expected to continue to benefit from our diversified fee-based income strategy. The full-
year results between $325 million and $345 million, and the first quarter between $80 million and $85 million. Full
year guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between $895 million and $915 million, which includes
the impact of approximately $6 million of rent expense during the build out phase of our new headquarters, while
we still occupy our current office space. Adjusting for this impact, the midpoint of our expense guidance results in
a 3.7% increase from 2023 operating expense levels.
The first quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between $225 million and $230 million, as the
compensation expense is higher in the first quarter, largely due to normal seasonal long-term stock
compensation, and higher payroll taxes at the start of the New Year. Full year provision guidance is $80 million to
$100 million and is dependent on net loan growth and charge-off activity. Lastly, the full-year effective tax rate
should be between 21% and 22%, which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

During 2023, FNB completed a number of initiatives that align with our strategic priorities, including introducing
the eStore Common application for consumer loan and deposit products, expanding our physical delivery
channel, and investing in systems and processes that enable us to streamline operation. We continue to expand
our data analytics capability and the use of AI to improve performance. These strategic initiatives have directly
contributed to our peer relative outperformance in 2023, amidst the banking industry disruption with the company
generating record operating EPS of $1.57 and strong organic loan growth of $2.4 billion. Deposit balances remain
flat with noninterest-bearing deposits comprising 29.4% of total deposits and a top quartile cost of funds.
We've completed over $75 million in costs savings over the last five years, excluding acquisition synergies,
leading to positive operating leverage and efficiency – and an efficiency ratio in the top quartile relative to peers at
51.2%. Operating return on average tangible common equity totaled 18% and tangible book value grew 15% to a
record $9.47. Our asset quality continues to be a strength as we ended the year at or near historically low levels.
This year's exceptional performance was made possible by our employees. Their commitment to FNB's mission
and values drive success for all of our stakeholders.
In 2023, our team's efforts were evident as FNB received more than 30 prestigious awards. Multiple independent
organizations recognized FNB's financial performance, outstanding culture and innovative technology with eStore
earning International. We believe that these honors and our outperformance are a direct result of our engaging
and rewarding workplace environment. I am proud of what we've built together. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And
our first question today comes from Daniel Tamayo from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Maybe we start on the impact of the balance sheet restructuring on the margin. I appreciate
the guidance for 2024. But just as we think about the impact on – in the first quarter. Curious if you can walk
through how you're thinking about the impact of the restructuring, looking at it as a 5 basis point or 6 basis point
impact relative to kind of just continued deposit pressure. And then how that the path of the margin as it moves
throughout the year in your assumptions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say a couple of things. First of all, if we look at the fourth quarter, and then I guess – will go
forward, net interest income only declined $2.6 million linked-quarter, which was the same as the prior quarter.
The NIM compression for the quarter was only 5 basis points. Last quarter was 11 basis points. In fact, November
and December were at 320 basis points. So the level kind of stabilized there, at least for those two months. The
restructuring is fully baked into our guidance that we provided. I think as far as the past with the margin here, I
would still say what we said last quarter that probably bottomed somewhere in the first half of the year and then
kind of some slight improvement from there as far you get into the second half of the year. But there's a lot to
happen, right, with the Fed cuts. I mean, we have three Fed cuts in ours, and there's three, four or five – the three
felt most reasonable to us. That's what's baked into our guidance.
You know, with the benefit of the restructuring and as we have over time, we'll continue to actively go after the
brand deposits, it's been a focus here. I think our percentage of total deposits has performed very well relative to
peers, the changes in that bucket have also kind of stacked up very well. So the NII guide kind of has everything
baked into it, Danny.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
No, I understand and I appreciate that. I guess another way of asking, maybe, do you think the deposit pressure
in the first quarter offset the – I mean, it sounds like you're saying we still maybe get more compression in the first
quarter on an overall basis. Do you think that offsets more than offsets the balance sheet restructuring and that
that just continues in the first half or in the first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we're not going to guide to – we're not going to specifically comment on margin for the quarter, right? You
know, the net interest income has all of that baked in, and the mix shift that has happened during the quarter,
we've continued to see customers going after higher rate products and that's just natural. People who're sitting
here feeling like, okay that is at the top average rate since July. When are they going to start to cut? So it's
definitely been some of that mix shift still occurring. In the first quarter, our demand deposits, that's usually our
weakest quarter seasonally because of municipal deposits that kind of bottom and then build up. So all of that
8


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
does put some pressure on the margin and then the restructuring helps offset some of those impacts in the first
quarter. Probably one way that I could comment on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. I guess just lastly, to just dig in on the balance sheet sensitivity side, just curious how we should be
thinking about, you mentioned bottoming in the middle of the year. I think in the past, we've talked about maybe
being liability sensitive in the medium term, but maybe asset sensitive in the near term with rate cuts. That's still
how we should be thinking about it. Perhaps some negative impact early on. And then maybe, after a few
quarters, that's when you start to benefit more from rate cuts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So that's definitely the right way to think about it. You know that the sensitivity, whether we get additional
cuts beyond the three, as you know, there's a lot of moving parts to this question and there's actions we may take
depending on the economic environment. So but as you described, the timeframe is key, right? In the short run,
you have a negative impact, particularly from the cuts sort of additional cuts. And then I think the deposit lags will
catch up over time. I mean, historically, if you look at our beta today, right, we're around 34% in the last upgrade
cycle. It's kind of maxed out at 35%. It seems reasonable to assume that, but that would change kind of more in
the medium term. Longer term, with cash back up – probably of the medium term with deposit rate lags that we
catch up and have that benefit.
And, as you know, we've taken a lot of actions. I mean, the CD book has been growing in the shorter term, 7-
month and 13-month type area. Our total average maturity of the CD portfolio right now is 10 months. So there's
opportunity there to reprice that as we go forward. Thank god for the timing of when the Fed would move. But
yeah, I think that's we're still slightly asset sensitive and really philosophically managing to neutral. And then we
think that if you look at our margin past for the year, it's kind of more neutral with the expected three cuts that we
have baked in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...about the dynamics of loan growth versus deposit growth year-on-year, obviously, your guide has you getting
closer to 100% loan to deposit over time? Just trying to think through what might be the main governor on loan
growth here and how you're bringing deposit dollars in the door in what continues to be a pretty competitive
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think, let me start out and then I can turn it over to Vince Calabrese. First of all, I think some of the things
that we talked about in the prepared comments relative to acquiring new clients is a way for us to drive deposit
balances. I mean, adding the ability to simultaneously open a deposit account with a loan application without
additional keystrokes, that's huge for us. So I think that'll help once the field starts utilizing these tools and
customers start engaging online and realize that they can do that, it'll increase our probability of capturing more of
the client relationship, particularly the deposit side. So when the loan request comes in, we'll be able to act a little
more quickly on opening the deposit account. So that's one thing that we plan for and we think will help us as we
move forward.
If you look at engagement with the eStore, we looked at – we rolled that out about midyear. So if you look at the
six months in 2022 versus the six months in 2023 in the same period, and you compare the number of
applications that we were able to obtain online, they've doubled. So we doubled the number of consumer loan
applications. That's without the deposit account opening capability by the way. And 30% of those clients – 30% of
those applications were with non-FNB customers. So that's one piece of it. The enhancements to the digital
strategy. The second opportunity for us is really in small business and middle market banking on the TM side.
We've invested pretty heavily in our Treasury management capabilities. We have some product capabilities
coming online. We mentioned that we're going to bundle products in the small business space in 2024, probably
towards the latter half of the year. We'll be rolling that out. That will also us grow deposit balances.
And if you look at what we've done historically, we've historically grown deposit balances around the 10% – 8% to
10% range organically. So I think we've kept pace with the organic loan growth that we've achieved, which is
similar, right, over a long period of time. And I think some of the things that we've done strategically and entering
into new markets that have more opportunities because of population growth and business formation, we're going
to be able to continue to achieve our objective, which is to fund our loan growth with the deposit balances that we
see from new customers. I don't know. Vince, do you want to add anything numerically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, no. All I would add, Frank, is that we don't get all the way to a 100 within our guidance. You know, we're in
that 95%, 96%, 97% kind of area as you kind of forecast it out. But, as we've done in the past, historically, when
we got to 97% going back a bunch of years, we took action. We took action this quarter selling the indirect auto
loans creates more shelf space for us. I mean, it was a 1% in the loan to deposit ratio. So we will manage that
level. We won't go all the way to 100%, we're in the mid-90s, which is what's baked into the guidance as I
mentioned, we'll start to manage. We get to 95%, we'll look at what's the environment, how fast are loans growing
and we'll take action as we always have just to kind of manage that.

You know, for us, it's not a function. It's not a question as to whether or not we can fund our balance sheet with
deposit growth. We can do that and we have the capability of doing it. It would just be a margin forever, right? So

It's a function of trying to manage it all so that we maintain relative profitability. Our goal is to outperform. So we're
not trying to give everything away or balloon our balance sheet. We are – we understand what our funding
constraints could potentially be, and the tradeoff is margin. So we have to be getting it on the other side, with the
loan originations to justify it. That's how we look at it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Sure. Oh, no. Understood. Understood. That's great color. Thanks. And then I guess just a follow-up there, Vince,
you mentioned the making some room with the smaller sale of the loans. Obviously, you're always thinking about
balance sheet optimization. But that being said, I just wonder if this is – if you see more opportunities here in the
near term to do just that, maybe jettison some smaller pieces that for whatever reason, the total returns are not
there. Is that a way in the near term to continue to hold the loan to deposit ratio where it is or is? Or do you see
this as more of like a one and done in the near term?

Yeah, no, I'd say we spent a lot of time during the fourth quarter sizing what we wanted to do as far as the amount
of security and the amount of the loans that we sell. So we don't have any plans to do any additional sales as
we're sitting here today. I think [indiscernible] (00:36:20) we have the ability to fund and grow the deposits, we've
done it forever. So at this point, I wouldn't say one and done forever, right? Because we're always studying the
balance sheet and if there's opportunities, we'll look at it. But there's no plans right now that like I said, we spent a
lot of time sizing it and came up with what we executed on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
If the rate environment enables us to unload low-yielding assets and you know, we get a gain and we can roll that
into something else. Sure. We've done that historically. We've sold over a $1 billion over the years. So we'll look
selectively, Frank. And, we constantly look at the balance sheet. Our objective is to produce the highest returns
possible. And we'll look at opportunities to get out, particularly with indirect auto, the limited relationship, right? I
mean, we'll look at that and we'll trade out of it or we pair that, right? We've used pricing mechanisms to move
some of the portfolio around, right?
And we'll see. It's all a function of what the interest rate environment is, what demand looks like in higher yielding
categories, what the risk profile of the balance sheet looks like. We take all of that into consideration and make
decisions based on that. But our plan is to manage in the range from a loan to deposit perspective that we have
historically. We're not looking to move outside of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would just say too, Frank, we're not – we don't feel constrained as far as loan growth that we would want
to go after. I mean, the mid-to-high single digits that we've done, we can do that. We've done things like Vince
was describing. And then like in the mortgage business, we've adjusted our pricing a little bit there to make a
more salable product. So we're kind of reducing the amount of growth that's going on to the balance sheet, which
is kind of part of how we manage the balance sheet. So there's a lot of different levers there.

Hi, Timur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...Vince, to lead, you had made a comment, positive operating leverage in 2023, you look to be in the top quartile
in operating leverage going forward. Does that put positive operating leverage on the table for 2024, or is the
revenue backdrop challenging enough or that's more likely not going to happen next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think as we move through this interest rate cycle, it becomes more challenging obviously, right, because
you're seeing decline in revenue and your expense base is pretty much fixed. So you take that expense out. It's
hard to fix income.
I think the second half of the year, I certainly would expect us to go produce positive operating leverage. So as we
move through that inflection point that Vince spoke about earlier, like the margin compression with the rate cuts,
we should be able to move through that and into the second half of the year to experience positive operating
leverage.
If you look at FNB on a full-year basis in 2023, we outperformed others, right, because we produced full-year
operating leverage. There was negative operating leverage all over the place, at least based on what I saw. So I
think I would expect us to do everything we can to be in a similar position in 2024. Hope that helps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And then one for Gary. Just looking at the office maturities in
2024, it looks like 20% of that book is maturing. I'm just wondering how much of that maturation is for loans kind
of vintage 2019 and earlier. And then as you look at your CRE portfolio, again, looking at the vintages 2019 and
earlier, how different are those loans from a credit quality standpoint, just given how different the world is today
versus pre-pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, generally speaking, no, we're going to underwrite those things from the origination date in the low to high
60s range. So, when you look at those maturities, in addition to that LTV level, which has been very helpful
through this cycle so far, they're also underwritten very short, so with maturities inside of five years or slightly less
in some cases. So a number of those or a number of those transactions have been renewed over the last year or
two. Many of those borrowers rightsized those transactions. It has been our intent to keep those maturities very
short. And we'll continue to do that during these times.
That all said, we're still as focused as we are on that office space, as is everyone. We feel quite good about the
portfolio at this point. We've only had a couple of credits over the last number of years when – since this space
has taken a tough go of it from all of the pandemic issues that we've seen. And we've only had a couple of credits
that we've had to deal with from a loss standpoint.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
So we feel good about the position of it. There is a 20% roll rate in the coming year, and we expect to move
through that with our sponsors, which have shown the ability to rightsize post additional interest reserves to pay
down debt and bring it back to a 120 basis points type of debt service coverage. So we'll continue to do the same
thing in 2024 that we did in 2023 then.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, so I'll add on to what Gary said. I think from a prudent underwriting perspective, most of the transactions
that we would have underwritten in 2019 would have had long-term leases that go out, longer than the maturity
date. Gary mentioned having a shorter maturity date. What that means is that while cap rates may change and
the valuation may change with a lower LTV and a longer lease term that the debt service coverage remains intact.
So, it's a lot easier to deal with a devaluation because of a rise in cap rate if you have substantial liquidity and a
long-term tenant locked up. So I think that in almost every case, that's what we would look at when we would
underwrite these transactions, which gives us a great degree of confidence.
I also can tell you that most of the portfolio, the vast majority of the portfolio sits outside of the urban office
scenario. So I think that we have quite a bit of protection in that suburban office and higher growth areas is not as
subject to vacancy like you see in the large cities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The other...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...that we can add sort of the size of the granularity...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
40% of the portfolio is less than $5 million in terms of loan size. You move that up to $5 million to $10 million, it's
another $17 million. And so you're pushing 60% of the portfolio is less than – almost 60% is less than $10 million.
And if you move that up one more level to $15 million and you're at 70% of the book of business. And in total, the
top 25 credits averaged right at just a touch above $30 million. I think its right at $31 million. So, the portfolio is
very granular. I think we've been very prudent in taking granular hold positions across that space. And it's really
shown in the performance through what's been a difficult time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's geographically diverse too as the other program spread across seven states but concentrated on one city and
one specific area. So that, we obviously it's something we watch as you know there's definitely weakness in urban
office. So it's a good question. Does that help?

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I wanted to follow-up on the NII guide. So Vince, see if – it sounds like deposit beta is going to peak at around
cum deposit beta peaks around 35%. Just wondering when does that take place relative to your first Fed cut, and
then what does your guide assume for deposit beta on the way down for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say we would drift a little higher. We ended the year at 34.3%, I think it says in the slide. We'll drift a
little bit higher here another 1 point or 2 points. It's what we're thinking. And then, when that happens for the
second quarter kind of consistent with the margin kind of bottoming in the first half of the year. And then, what we
were thinking, I mentioned the – I'll say it's been 35% now twice on the upside. I think we – as we look to the point
when the Fed pivots and starts to reduce rates using a similar over the medium term right 35% makes sense to
us. But within 2024, depending on the timing of the Fed cuts, right? I mean, we get some portion of that. Probably
get more than half of it. But you wouldn't get 35% all in calendar 2024.
So, as we have been, we're actively managing our deposit book on the pricing and in our weekly pricing
committee meetings, we're already start to talk about when do we lower rates, some of our competitors have. So
we're going to monitor very closely, discuss it constantly and we'll take the right action at the right time. But,
somewhere in that second half or so that 35% might get this year.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, no. Understood. Understood. And then just switching to credit. Gary, if I'm here, if I'm interpreting your
remarks correctly, it sounds like you expect net charge-offs to go – to decline this year. I'm just wondering what
kind of loss rate your provision guide contemplates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, in terms of the provision guide, the 80% to 100%, naturally, that supports loan growth as well as
charge-offs, the specific charge-off level that we've got baked into our plans I mean that's some – that's a number
we don't disclose. But I would concur with your thoughts. I mean, we do expect performance to be stable to
slightly improve as [indiscernible] (00:48:29)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But I think, Casey, if you go to page 9 in our presentation, you can see net charge-offs to average loans. You
know, the third quarter of 2023 has – we have that onetime event that occurs. So, I mean, we're...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, fair enough. That's – that was a – yeah, great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's what you're seeing in your charge-offs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, if you look over the last three years, Casey, the last three years would have been 6 basis points, and 2023
would have been 10 basis points, excluding that one item. So you've got really solid, steady performance there
over a very, pretty sizable extended and somewhat tumultuous period. And like I said, we like the position of the
portfolio. We feel quite good about it going into 2024. Naturally, we're all concerned a bit about, where is this
economy going? And what will that all mean? And that has to play out, as we all know. But, we're seeing good,
steady performance and stable outcomes across the portfolios.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And just last one for me, Vince Delie, you mentioned, your TCE is at the highest level, I think, in your
history and the CET1 above 10%. How are you guys thinking about, what's the share buyback appetite with your
capital ratios at current levels?

And we still have, we have authorization to repurchase shares from the board. We plan on evaluating that as we
move along. If we see opportunities to buy shares back, we're certainly going to do it. If the earn back is
reasonable, right? I mean, we just we're going to manage tangible book value levels as well. So I think we're
going to continue to look at it and evaluate it and opportunistically execute transactions if they make sense.
The deployment of capital as we move forward, really, we're looking at the potential for changes in the economy
and loan growth as well, because we want to – we want to deploy that capital in the most meaningful way. But if
we see, slowness, we're not just going to sit here and continue to build capital [indiscernible] (00:51:15) we have
to do to make sure the returns are [indiscernible] (00:51:19). I don't know if that answers your question or not.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the color so far. I really just have one last question I wanted to hit on for
Gary on the credit piece just, yesterday Discover reported earnings and had some uptick on the consumer side in
their prime book, lines of credit, autos and things of that nature. Just curious, what you guys are seeing on the
consumer side and from a credit health perspective, most of those portfolios outside the mortgage book I think
shrunk this year. Just what type of growth is baked into to 2024? And, what are some of the maybe the key things
that could drive some better growth performance on the consumer side? Is it just kind of a macro health
environment? Is it pricing competitive dynamics? Just would love some color around all those topics that would be
great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, total delinquency across that all-inclusive portfolio, which is right at about $12 billion is 89 basis points. So
that's – that's all-in consumer. The fourth quarter is always up a little bit seasonally at the end of the year with the
holidays and whatnot. But if you look over a rolling 13-month timeframe, it's been from 70 basis points to the low-
90s. So we've seen very consistent performance across that portfolio, the underwriting that we do there. I feel
very good about I think it's very, very prudent and very stable. We're able to generate good loan growth, through
those portfolios. And when you when you look at the investment that we've made and the teams there, it's an
important part of our business. So, as we look forward, we continue to expect good, solid growth there in that
business, at slightly higher range in this environment, with higher single-digit range in this environment. And
expect that portfolio continue to perform well through the cycle that we're [indiscernible] (00:54:05)

That's helpful. So it sounds like in the mid-single digit growth guidance, there's some consumer growth baked into
that for 2024. That's the expectation as you stand today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A

Yes, and mortgage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, including mortgage, but if you stripped out more, we're still expecting growth. And again, I think some of the
investments we've made in the digital tools, the fact that we're spread across a pretty wide geography that's 60
million consumers in our footprint. Some of the build out with the ATM delivery channel that heightens – provides
consumers with accessibility to cash and our brand, I think all of that gives us a little bit of confidence even though
I would say the consumer with inflation and some of the changes economically that are going on are going to be a
little challenged, I think we're in a pretty good spot to continue to grow the book, not as robustly as we have in the
past. I know it's been last year it was tough, but things are going to stabilize and we should see in a lower rate
environment some opportunities to grow that portfolio. But that's baked into the guide.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q

Hey, good morning, guys. And I just wanted to follow-up on the balance sheet repositioning and around the
tangible book value earn back math. So I get the securities repositioning. I just wanted to confirm that the
preferred stock dividend saving is included in that calculation. And then just asked for some additional color on
the indirect auto piece. What rate borrowings would be paid down, whether there's any reserve release
associated with those loans included in that math, just trying to get the puts and takes.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Yeah. So, Russell, so as you know, the securities repositioning was done on the available for sale portfolio. So
that was only already baked into the tangible book values. There's no incremental hit from that. There's very slight
hit from the loan sale. But just given the overall strong earnings accretion from the combined transaction that earn
back is less than a year, when you add in the preferred dividend, it still stays obviously because that's accretive to
that, would be less than a year. So, pretty strong earn back metrics. Anything – sorry, did I address all your
questions there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
The auto piece and what the just kind of puts and takes in the savings were there? Just the rate of borrowings
you'd expect to pay down and whether there's any reserve release associated with those loans that's included in
that calculation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Got you. Yeah. No, so the borrowings we talked about paying off at a similar rate as the yield on the loans, so
we're talking roughly 5% to 5.5% type yield on those loans. So.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Net, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Net. So, pay down borrowings at a similar rate and just as a reminder, that loan sale hasn't closed yet. So we
actually haven't seen the capital benefits from that whole transaction. So just on a pro forma basis, when the
loans do go off the balance sheet, we'd expect to see if you want increase, on an estimated 10 basis points NPV
to increase, roughly 6 basis points as well on top of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then there's no interest. There's no additional income statement impact, Russell, in the first quarter because
with us marking it to the market, that captures everything in the fourth quarter. So really it's just actually executing
the sale itself.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you, guys. And then I guess just the last follow-up then would be back to the CET1 discussion. Pro forma
still north of that 10%, you guys addressed your repurchases, but also sensitivity around earn back. So not willing
to let capital [indiscernible] (00:58:25) are additional securities repositionings on the table or how are you thinking
about that?

No, I think, we spent a lot of time in the fourth quarter sizing what we did. So we don't have any plans to do any
additional securities. So we sit here. Remember, during the last few years, I mean, we stayed short from our
investment portfolio, we stayed conservative and how we manage that. So, the total dollar amount that we did
there was kind of the total we're looking to do. We don't have [indiscernible] (00:58:59) and then from a capital
ratio perspective, within our guidance, I mean, our capital ratios will drift up as you go through the year, which is
important. And then to Vince's point earlier, opportunistically that will create an ability to do share buybacks if it
make sense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And I like to see tangible book value, above $10, right? I mean, that would be something that we could all
celebrate because I think ultimately that translates into a higher valuation for us, given our profitability. But, so
we're going to be managing all of that. We're going to be watching all of that and making smart decision based
upon return pressures.

Manuel Navas Q

Hey, good morning. I just wanted to get a bit of your economic backdrop behind your loan growth guidance and
then behind the provisioning guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I mean, economic environment, I mean, is kind of what the consensus economists would be saying. I mean, its
slowing growth in the second half of the year. We're not making kind of calls on our own. We're kind of looking at

what the expectations are from the economists throughout the country, and that's kind of what's baked in. And all
the GDPs guiding our plan goes down to like a zero point, but it's still growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Still 2 point on average.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
On average for the year, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So if the expectations...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[indiscernible] (01:00:53) I'm sorry, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
So to add expectation, if it was to worsen, would the provision be above the range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think we're very comfortable with the range we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right. Yeah, and we feel very comfortable with the range at this point on the economy – where the economy is
today and how the portfolio is positioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And then loan growth, the pace has been really strong here to close the year. And is that kind of more frontend
loaded as it kind of slows across the back half of the year or is it you feel pretty good about that mid-single digits
kind of staying consistent across the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I think – yeah, I mean, there's seasonality within the originations depending on the portfolio. If you look at the
commercial book, it tends – it tends to grow more in the second into the third quarter. If you look at mortgage
banking, I mean move that up a little bit, maybe a quarter, really a first and second quarter, it starts to take off. So
there are differences in the portfolios. I just use those two as an example. But, I think when we build our plan to
give consensus, we look at both macro and micro scenarios. So basically we built our plan from the ground up.
21


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
We survey our business units, we look at our production capability, historically, in the markets we're in, and then
we look at the macroeconomic environment, say is this achievable and, what's happening.
And we basically use that's why Vince said, we use consensus estimates by economists, we don't forecast
ourselves, we use somebody else's forecast and then we apply that to our model. So it's all kind of baked into to
what we give you. So we're building it from inside of our own company. And then we're looking at the
macroeconomic factors if it influence that. That goes for provision expense, loan growth, commercial, consumer
mortgage, kind of break it down by segment and then build it from the ground up.
And so I think given where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing, hard to predict, but we're a little more
optimistic than we were a quarter ago going into next year. And I think that's reflected in the guide on the loan
growth. I'm hoping we can do better.
If you look at our pipelines, we did pretty well commercially in the last quarter, it's reflected in the loan growth, and
it surged in the fourth quarter. That can change from year to year commercially. But we did well last quarter. So
when you look at our pipelines moving forward, we're relatively flat. So you don't have this big pipeline that we're
looking at that says, hey, yeah, we're going to achieve 3% or 4% or 5% or whatever the mid-single digit in that
portfolio close to. So I would say that I feel pretty confident about what we're putting forward given what we know
about the economy today.
I don't know if that helps.

Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's great. No, no, that's really helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And that gives you confidence.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
No, that's great. Can I add? Is there any kind of regional takeaways from your eStore performance? You have a
lot of activity. You have lot of non-account holders using the eStore. Can you break it down regionally at all, or is it
just great trends in general?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, that's an interesting question. I had just asked our people that question. So I ask the same question
internally. It's still relatively new. We're trying to figure out how to devise reporting that get us as granular as we
need to be from an origination perspective.
When they initially looked at it, it's pretty much across the board, which is interesting. It wasn't in one particular
geography, it was spread across pretty broad geographies. So I think anywhere where we have name recognition,
branch location, right, we tend to get more action. Once you move outside of that, we don't advertise a lot, so you
don't see as much activity.
22


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
So which is part of the reason why we decided to go with branded ATMs and do the ATM deployment? Because
our theory was that the more frequently consumers see us, the more likely they are to engage us digitally. That
was part of the strategy. So, it seems to be working. If you look at where our geographic locations are, where we
have signage, and some recognition, there's more activity digital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's great. I appreciate that. Thank you, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then obviously, we're going to get – now that we've added the deposit products in December, we are going to
start advertising. So we will try to grow that through some advertising, bring some awareness to the consumer, up
the capability. I know locally I saw, during the Super Bowl we managed to pull that, not for Super Bowl, but the
national championship for the college football. [indiscernible] (01:06:35) Steelers were already out, so I'm lost.
But we did some – we did some sport. Let's put it this way. We were in the playoff game. We ran during the
Steelers-Buffalo Bills game. We ran during the national championship probably locally, right, because we have
customers that are in tune with those events. So we ran some advertising and some people commented on it.
And then the branding of the buildings in certain markets has helped us with visibility, particularly for – I think
we've seen more activity from a prospect – prospecting perspective because of the signage on our headquarters
building and that activity has brought some people in. And then the sponsorships with the penguins, the away
jersey, the patch, you've got a lot of play on that as well. But anyway, that's how we're trying to build awareness.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
...most of my questions have been answered. Just one question, Vince, you answered it. I think the last question
was just on the cadence of the commercial growth of the commercial pipeline, it sounds like it's a little bit slower to
start here given what fourth quarter look like. But pipe builds from there, that's just in general what I heard, is that
fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Yeah, we – I mean, we had a really strong third quarter that kind of cleared out the 90-day bucket on the
pipeline. And that has to rebuild. So it's relatively flat. We had good production out of the Carolinas. There's
double-digit growth in some of the Carolina portfolios that is pretty positive without CRE, without a big contribution
from CRE. So, we're pretty excited about that. And I think there'll be opportunity in the Midwest and in the
Northeast as well from a C&I perspective as we move into next year, the latter half of next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay. And then just one for Gary. Gary, the credit is – it sounds very strong. I mean, I guess if you point
to one area today that you're, maybe a bit more watchful of and especially – to criticize it sounds like they were
down this quarter. But just in general, is there any area that you're paying a bit more attention to as you kind of
head into 2024, given the strength of the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think the CRE book just in general, I mean, we've been all over that and the team has done a really nice
job of building out risk management practices around that. Tom Fisher and his team are all over those books of
business as they are the rest of the portfolio but, the office space naturally, we've said it for years that was going
to be a longer term portfolio segment in the industry that is going have to be dealt with over time. I mean, that
change was, I would say, not temporary. There's been a permanent change in that market. Fortunately, I think
we've chosen well there over time, with solid sponsors that have liquidity. And I think that's why that portfolio has
continued to perform as it has to this point. But you know that CRE space in that office portfolio, I think it has a
way to go yet, Brian. So we'll continue to be all over that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah, and then maybe just last two, just on the fee income side, just kind of looking at the pickup in mortgage.
And you talked a little bit about it kind of a little bit of a change in your strategy there, just kind of the puts and
takes on mortgage outlook for here. And then just the capital markets revenue, it's pretty consistent, maybe a little
bit lower level from where it was previous years. Just kind of wondering how to think about that or just how the
pipeline looks there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would just say the noninterest income again shows the benefit of having converged high revenue base,
right? And we've had another good quarter above 80%. We've been above 80% six out of the last seven quarters,
getting there different ways but, again, the benefit of diversification. So, capital markets was a solid quarter for us.
I mean, it's up from the prior quarter, it's down from last year when it had a [indiscernible] (01:11:35). But there's
still a lot of opportunity there. And I think when the rate environment starts to shift, there will continue to be
opportunity there.
But we had really solid contributions from all the components there, from the swap perspective, international
syndication to capital markets. So there's a lot of fixes even within that business and then, the mortgage bounced
back, I mean, we had a really strong 2023 I mean, in an environment where the market was down from an
origination standpoint, the overall industry was down. We were up. And we're forecasting for – from an origination
standpoint, we have close to double-digit increase in originations in 2024 versus 2023. And then my comments on
pricing was more just about salable versus portfolio, not really affecting the level of originations, but kind of what
we bring on the balance sheet and what we sell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, the other thing I would say is, we're in a lower rate environment. If we do get the rate decreases, we should
see more activity and derivatives, more activity in debt capital markets with our large corporate customers going
to market to raise capital. And, syndication should pick up in the second half of the year or so. And then the
mortgage business, gain on sale should accelerate. So, like Vince said, having a portfolio and then we've had
good, steady growth. I should mention that, our asset management and the wealth and trust shops have done
extraordinarily well. So, they're up in revenue and net income, they've grown net assets under...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Record levels too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I mean, we're at record levels. So we're in good markets where we should see continued growth in that book. So
we have a good balanced set of fee generators that I think in the coming year, if rates play out the way some are
forecasting, we should do okay with noninterest income.

And then initiatives on the small business in TM side will be additive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah, No, the businesses you guys have built out are really paying dividends here and like you said, the
diversification. And I guess on the mortgage, I was just trying to understand, Vince, if part of the increase this
quarter was really just you selling more and if so, if you do have an increase in originations next year and you
continue to sell at a higher rate, maybe that also contributes to a better outlook for 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, the gain on sale margin is lower though. You know, like...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It depends on the rate environment, but when you look at it, we may have sold, but we're not making as much per
unit. We're just moving it off the balance sheet because the rate environments provide us with the opportunity to
do that. So and we're remember, we focused principally on purchase money. So that activity has been lower,
right? I mean, we don't – we're not – in a declining rate environment, we would see more refinance activity even
though we focus more on purchase money, we would get some benefit from the refinance market. So if there's
tradeoffs, but I think it's a pretty balanced approach. And I think that's – I think we've been able to sustain our fee
income levels through this period, even with declining consumer fee income, right? We done pretty good on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And Brian, I would just add, the mortgage income in the fourth quarter had benefit from rates coming down to the
fair value mark on the pipeline is contributed to that in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay, perfect. And then just the last one for me. It's just on the margin Vince, expenses, just the one
question, just remind me, I mean, from a variable rate perspective, I mean, the percentage of variable rate loans
and the if, a 25 basis point cut on that piece, how much has that moved the margin for each kind of 25 basis point
cut?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You need to look at the whole balance sheet, right?

what's gone on this year, FNB has performed very well and many of the key strategies that we've deployed, that
we've talked about over the years, really played out during the liquidity crisis earlier this year. You got to see
firsthand what we've been talking about in terms of client primacy, the quality of our deposit portfolio and our
credit underwriting. So I think it's – it really showed itself this year and I'm very excited about moving into next
