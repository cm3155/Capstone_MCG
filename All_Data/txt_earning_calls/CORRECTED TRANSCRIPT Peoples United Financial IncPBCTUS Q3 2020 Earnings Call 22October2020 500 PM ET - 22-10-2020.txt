Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones
are remaining safe and healthy.
Before discussing the results, I want to take a moment to thank our employees who have successfully adapted to
the pandemic-driven environment and its many challenges. This has enabled them to effectively meet customer
needs, successfully introduce AlwaysChecking, our new free digital identity protection service, and further
advance strategic initiatives. Very proud of the dedication our employees have displayed and the creative ways
that they have supported customers and each other during these uncertain times. This is a reflection of the deeply
ingrained culture Peoples United has which has been built over many years and differentiates the company in the
markets we serve.
Let's begin by turning to slide 2. We are pleased with our third quarter financial and operating performance which
is the result of strong execution across the franchise. Operating earnings of $144.7 million increased 43% linked
quarter and 7% from a year ago. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.34, up $0.10 from
the previous quarter and in line with the prior year. These results benefited from solid fee income, well-maintained
expenses, reduced provision linked quarter, and lower effective tax rate. Partially offsetting these favorable items
was net interest margin compression.
Our continued thoughtful approach to expense management and the realization of projected cost savings from
acquisitions drove a 300-basis-point improvement year-over-year in the third quarter efficiency ratio to 53.8%. We
are particularly pleased that with our ability to successfully control cost and strengthen operating leverage has led
to a significant enhancement in the efficiency ratio in recent years. Full-year efficiency ratio has improved annually
since 2013 when reported a ratio of 62.3%, by 2019 the ratio was down to 55.8% and we expect this improving
trend will continue in 2020 as the year-to-date efficiency ratio stands at 53.8%. Importantly, we remain focused on
expense management and discipline and we are also steadfast in our commitment to investing strategically in the
business. Such investments include further enhancing digital capabilities, delivering innovative products and
services and strengthening leadership and talent.
The third quarter was indicative of this commitment. We announced the formation of our Business Transformation
Office in August. This specialized team will lead the company's efforts related to digitization, process automation
and fintech relationships. We are excited about the enhancements and efficiencies this team will deliver moving
forward. During the quarter our focus on expanding digital capabilities was evident in treasury management as we
bolstered their suite of technology. In partnership with multiple fintech firms we implemented Integrated Payables
and Invoice-to-Pay Solutions as well as an electronic billing and payment offering. These additions deliver simple,
secure digital capabilities for commercial banking customers.
In July, we introduced AlwaysChecking, a premium digital identity protection service which we are providing free
to all personal checking account customers. This offering builds on our core value proposition of service and
protection and we are confident that it will further attract and retain customers. And in August we expanded the
regional leadership team and our wealth management business, People's United Advisors with the addition of
senior executives in New York and Massachusetts. The addition of these two seasoned industry veterans will
further benefit customer retention and drive profitable growth in their respective regions.
Moving on to the balance sheet, period end loans and deposits, each declined 1% linked quarter leaving the loan
to deposit ratio unchanged at 91%. Commercial period end loans grew $422 million from June 30 due to record
mortgage warehouse balances and the solid growth by LEAF within our equipment finance segment.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Conversely, the retail period end loans decreased $643 million mostly due to our planned reduction of residential
mortgages as we further remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. The modest decline in
period-end deposits resulted from runoff of higher cost wholesale funding and lower municipal balances, partially
offset by strong commercial deposit growth.
It is evident the pandemic has significantly affected the economy. Demand within our commercial real estate and
middle market, C&I businesses has been limited due to the reduced economic activity and funding provided by
PPP loans. Lower demand is particularly demonstrated by C&I line utilization rates, which declined for the second
consecutive quarter and are below their historical quarterly averages. Similar to the second quarter, we did
experienced some areas of growth, in particular mortgage warehouse continues to benefit from robust origination
activity in both the purchase and refinance segments, as well as from solid growth in new customer relationships.
In addition, LEAF has continued to perform well primarily due to increased customer demand for technology,
hardware and software. And this trend is attributable to the strong growth from a number of significant long-
standing vendor relationships with LEAF and VAR Technologies (sic) [VAR Technology] (00:08:31) which we
acquired last year.
The total impact of the pandemic on the long-term economy is unknown. However, improvements in economic
activity during the quarter provided us a level of cautious optimism as we look ahead. Another positive indicator
was the significant reduction in the number of our customers needing relief as the total loan deferrals were
approximately $1.6 billion or 3.5% of total loans at September 30, down from more than $7.1 billion or 15.8% of
total loans at the end of June.
Additionally, deferrals have continued to decline since the close of the third quarter. These results are consistent
with the expectations we provided on our second quarter earnings call. We believe this improvement is a
testament to our long held conservative underwriting approach and reflects the strong capital and liquidity profile
of our customers. The forbearance level at quarter-end was comprised of almost $1.4 billion of second deferrals
and $217 million of loans still in their first deferral period. Notably, our relationship managers continue to maintain
high-level of contact with customers to closely evaluate their financial condition and help them navigate their
specific situations. As expected, the largest concentration of second deferrals were in our $1.1 billion hospitality
portfolio which includes hotels. Total deferrals in this portfolio were approximately $670 million at quarter end,
which includes $640 million of second deferrals.
In comparison, total deferrals at the close of the second quarter were $876 million. The hotel industry has been
significantly impacted by the pandemic. The severity of the impact varies by property, influenced by many factors
including hotel type, primary customer base and location. The challenges faced by this industry will likely extend
into next year. As such, we expect to offer modifications to most of our hotel customers after their deferral period
ends.
Our strong relationship with these customers has facilitated ongoing conversations which provided granular views
of their current operations and financial resources. This has driven a constructive and collaborative process to
determine appropriate terms to continue support. Importantly, our hotel portfolio is well diversified particularly by
geography. Of note, only 6% or approximately $55 million of our hotel loans are collateralized by properties in
New York City.
We have confidence that the strength and experience of our hotel owner operators in our originated portfolio
should enable them to successfully emerge from the pandemic driven industry slowdown. Two other portfolios we
have previously called out as significantly affected by the pandemic, commercial retail and restaurants, have

performed well and experienced a substantial decline in deferrals. Our $3.5 billion CRE retail portfolio has seen
deferrals improve from $1.5 billion at the end of the second quarter to $138 million at the close of September.
As a reminder, this portfolio does not have material exposure to enclose malls and essential tenants such as
grocery stores, pharmacies and big box home improvement locations comprise roughly half of the portfolio.
Similarly, deferrals in the restaurant portfolio which has approximately $500 million of loan balances have
declined from $290 million at June 30 to $45 million at the end of the third quarter. The portfolio is mostly in well-
known national quick service franchises which have established and experienced a lesser degree of disruption
especially where drive-thru traffic remained strong. Deferrals have continued to improve since the close of the
quarter and notably our franchise finance business no longer has any deferrals in its restaurant book.
Finally, we announced the sale of Peoples United Insurance Agency to AssuredPartners for $120 million in cash.
The transaction allows us to simplify our operating model and monetize the company's long-term investment in
this business at an attractive multiple of 3.7 times trailing 12-month revenues. It also enables us to focus
additional resources on delivering core banking products and services and further enhance digital offerings which
will generate superior returns for shareholders over time. The transaction is projected to close in the fourth quarter
subject to customary closing conditions. And we expect to realize a pre-tax net gain of approximately $75 million
to $80 million which will improve the CET 1 ratio by 15 basis points.
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the third quarter in more detail, I want to thank our colleagues at
People's United Insurance Agency for their meaningful contributions to People's United over the years.
With that, I'll turn it to David.

Thank you, Jack. I will begin on slide 3. We are pleased with our strong third quarter financial performance which
was highlighted by pre-provision net revenue of $198.9 million, an increase of 4% linked quarter and 15% from a
year ago. On an operating basis, PPNR, $203.5 million was down 3% compared to the previous quarter due to a
modest increase in expenses, but marked an improvement of 14% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses on
loans of $27.1 million decreased $53.7 million from the second quarter, and further strengthened the allowance
for credit losses to total loans by 3 basis points to 94 basis points or 99 basis points excluding PPP loans. The
provision was comprised of $17.3 million of net charge offs which were up $18.8 million linked-quarter and an
increase of $9.8 million in the allowance for credit losses, down from an increase of $72.3 million in the second
quarter.
As you can see on slide 3, we break down the allowance for credit losses by loan portfolio segment. The total
allowance at September 30 of nearly $424 million, up from $414 million at the end of the second quarter, provide
significant coverage as it represents more than 6 times our annualized third quarter net charge offs at 138% of
nonperforming loans. The allowance at quarter-end reflects consideration of a baseline economic forecast, as well
as a more adverse scenario, each prepared as of late September. The baseline scenario reflects modest
improvement in most key economic variables compared to the baseline scenario employed at the end of the
second quarter. The more adverse scenario includes continued uncertainty associated with the status and extent
of further economic stimulus and the upcoming election. The cumulative year-to-date allowance build is
approximately $177 million which increased the allowance to total loans ratio by 37 basis points since year-end
2019 or 42 basis point excluding PPP balances.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Moving to slide 4, net interest income of $391.4 million decreased $14.2 million or 4% from the second quarter,
primarily due to a smaller average balance sheet and lower margin. The loan portfolio unfavorably impacted net
interest income by $21.6 million. In addition, lower average balances in the securities portfolio reduced net
interest income by $2.2 million. These headwinds were partially offset by lower deposit costs and an additional
calendar day in the third quarter, which benefited net interest income by $5.7 million and $2.5 million respectively.
A reduction in borrowings also favorably impacted net interest income by $1.4 million as average balances
decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have reduced borrowings nearly $4 billion on a
period end basis as a result of $6 billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year. Of note, net interest
income benefited $14.7 million from PPP during the quarter which reflects $9.9 million in related fees and $4.8
million in net interest income.
As displayed on slide 5, net interest margin of 2.97% was 8 basis points lower than the second quarter. The loan
portfolio unfavorably impacted the margin by 15 basis points, primarily driven by new business yields remaining
lower than the total portfolio yield and downward repricing in the floating rate loans. The largest offset to this
negative effect was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing which benefited the margin by 4 basis
points. Average deposit costs were 29 basis points in the third quarter compared to 34 basis points in the second
quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs.
In addition, one more calendar day in the third quarter and reduced borrowing benefited the margin by a collective
3 basis points. PPP had a 3 basis point unfavorable impact on the margins in the third quarter. As you will recall,
the impact in the second quarter was negligible as the loans were not on [indiscernible] (00:20:14) for the full
three months.
Turning to loans on slide 6. Average balances were down $300 million or 1% from the second quarter, while
period-end loans decreased $221 million or 1%. Both, average and period-end loans benefited from record
mortgage warehouse balances and solid growth by lease. Mortgage warehouse period-end balances closed the
quarter at $3.8 billion, up $768 million from June 30, as strong results continued to be driven by robust mortgage
origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships.
Lease average and period-end balances grew 3% and 5%, respectively, in the second quarter, primarily driven by
customer demand for technology hardware and software. These favorable results were more than offset by lower
retail balances and continued low loan demand in our commercial real estate and middle market C&I businesses
due to subdued economic activity and funding provided by PPP loans. The $643 million decrease in retail period-
end loans was mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages, which drove balances down
$528 million from the close of the second quarter.
Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the
quarter at $559 million, down $62 million linked-quarter and $178 million year-to-date. In addition, the period-end
balance for the United loans we have chosen to run off was $905 million, a decline of $57 million from June 30
and $208 million since year-end. Our expectation for each of these portfolios to run off between $200 million to
$300 million for the full year is unchanged.
Finally, quarter-end PPP balances of $2.6 billion were up modestly from $2.5 billion at June 30. On an average
basis, PPP loans were $2.5 billion, up approximately $700 million linked-quarter as these loans were not on the
books for the full three months of Q2.

Moving on to deposits on slide 7, average balances were up $1.1 billion or 2% from the second quarter, while
period-end balances declined $298 million or 1%. The modest decline in period-end deposits resulted from the
runoff of higher-cost wholesale funding and lower municipal balances, partially offset by strong commercial
deposit growth, particularly in mortgage warehouse. Both average and period-end balances grew across all
deposit categories, with the exception of time. Average time balances decreased nearly $1.4 billion from the
second quarter, while on a period-end basis balances were down more than $1.2 billion. The decrease in time
deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate
environment.
Notably, period-end non-interest bearing deposits increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. Balances were up
$445 million from the end of the second quarter to $14.1 billion. Non-interest bearing deposits now account for
more than 28% of total period-end balances, up from 22% at year-end.
Looking at slide 8, non-interest income rebounded in the third quarter to $101.1 million, up $11.5 million or 13%
from the second quarter and reflected improved results across most businesses. The largest increase was bank
service charges, which grew $4.2 million due to higher levels of customer activity. Commercial banking lending
fees were up $2.1 million, primarily driven by increased C&I loan prepayment fees.
Higher investment management and cash management fees collectively benefited non-interest income by $2.1
million. Insurance revenues increased $700,000, while operating lease income grew $600,000. In addition, other
non-interest income was up $3.3 million. The primary driver of the increase was $1.5 million in higher gains on the
sale of residential mortgage loans. The largest offset to these increases was a $1.5 million reduction in customer
interest rate swap income, which continues to be unfavorably impacted by subdued demand for commercial real
estate loans.
On slide 9, non-interest expense of $293.6 million decreased $10.4 million or 3% linked-quarter. The third quarter
included $4.6 million of non-operating cost, a reduction $13.9 million compared to the second quarter and were in
the following categories, $2 million in other non-interest expense, $1.4 million in professional and outside
services, $900,000 in occupancy and equipment and $300,000 in compensation and benefits. Excluding non-
operating cost, non-interest expense of $289 million increased $3.5 million or 1% compared to the previous
quarter.
The modest increase was primarily attributable to $2.9 million in higher other expenses, $600,000 in higher
professional and outside service costs and $500,000 in additional operating lease expenses. The largest offset to
these increases was $600,000 in lower compensation and benefit.
Briefly on slide 10, you can clearly see the 300-basis point improvement year-over-year in the efficiency ratio. As
Jack referenced earlier, the 53.8% efficiency ratio is a product of our ability to generate positive operating
leverage, and in particular realized projected cost savings from acquisitions. We will remain very diligent in our
management of expenses and continue to be focused on enhancing operational leverage as we move forward in
the current low interest rate environment.
Our asset quality remains excellent. As displayed on slide 11, non-performing assets as a percentage of loans
and REO of 71 basis points was up slightly from 69 basis points in the second quarter, but remains below our
peer group and top-50 banks. Net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 15 basis points were up 7 basis
points linked-quarter. The increase was primarily driven by two accounts. One represented a C&I account, which
was experiencing difficulties prior to the pandemic and the other was an acquired CRE loan.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Turning to slide 12, the 43% increase in operating earnings linked-quarter generated a significant improvement
and returns for the third quarter. Operating return on average assets of 94 basis points increase 36 basis points
from the second quarter. While operating return on average tangible common equity of 13.4% was up 530 basis
points.
Finally on slide 13, we remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital ratios
continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. It is
again important to note, adjusting for PPP loans the pro forma Tier 1 Leverage ratio at quarter end is 8.6% for the
holding company compared to 8.2% and 9.1% for the bank, compared to 8.7%. Additionally, the TCE ratio
excluding PPP is approximately 7.9% versus the reported 7.5%.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're
ready for questions.

Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John LaViola Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was wondering if we could just start on the expense outlook. Obviously, you've been able to drive your efficiency
ratio down over the past couple of quarters. So, where do you think this can go over the next couple of years? Do
you have a target?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
We don't have a target that we're going to share publicly for the next couple of years. What I would say is both,
Jack and I, talked about it in the prepared remarks. We've been highly focused for many years at this point on
operational improvements and decrease in the efficiency ratio and we think we have a very strong record that we
also think we will be able to continue to work down from here.

In this environment, it's tougher to do as you know. But at this point in the year, we won't be sharing any targets,
come January but we're talking about year-end. We hope to be back into the business of providing targets and
guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John LaViola Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. I appreciate the color there. Maybe just switching over to the margin, I know there are a lot of moving parts
at year end. Could you maybe share your outlook for that for the remainder of the year and maybe into 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Again, I would go back to a question on the last quarter call about the margin from a long-term perspective. So, it
really wasn't the back half of 2020 or 2021, but just if we stayed in this interest rate environment for an extremely
extended period of time, what we shared was we could conceive of the margin going down to [ph] 280 to 290
(00:32:35). I wouldn't back away from that outlook. But again, that's not specific to any timeframe, most notably
2021.
Just if we stay here for multiple, multiple years, I think that can happen. What I would do is, I would look at what
we've been doing to protect the margin in this environment this year. And I think we've had a pretty good track
record year-to-date at being able to move deposit cost down, being able to maintain yields in our securities
portfolio. And then to offset as much as possible the floating rate loans that are on the balance sheet, which is
about 45% of that book.
I would also add that as we call out in the script about nice performance, loan growth [ph] in (00:33:40) our
equipment. Finance businesses are great generators of short-term fixed rate assets and the remixing of the
balance sheet has been a real positive for us in the last couple of years protecting the margins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John LaViola Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And, David, correct me if I'm wrong. I believe, you mentioned that PPP
balances did tick up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Was that primarily due to new customers or existing
customers, could you maybe provide a little bit of color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. On an ending balance basis, they were only up $100 million on the round, but on an average balance basis,
they were up $700 million. That was more jobs, the volume that went on in the second quarter [indiscernible]
(00:34:39) was more back-end loaded. So we had a more modest average balance in Q2, but we did do PPP
loans right up until the end. But, frankly, the volumes really trailed off as the program got extended.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
And we did, we did make PPP loans to both, existing customers and new customers as well.

now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thanks. Some of the banks that we've heard from this quarter have been adding, let's say, qualitative
reserves based sort of above and beyond the Moody's baseline just given the uncertainty over whether or not
fiscal or federal stimulus actually gets passed. Can you just talk about like how you balance it where you are in
terms of your reserve between the baseline and more adverse scenario, and have you moved it more towards the
adverse recently? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yes. Hi, Ken. Yeah. So this − as you know baseline economic scenarios were more favorable in Q3 than Q2 and
two parts − two answers to your question. So we did weigh a more adverse scenario, more highly in Q3 versus
Q2 to compensate in some respects to what you're alluding to. We also each quarter have a qualitative overlays
that are part of the CECL process and those reflect management judgments about lots of different things, level of
deferrals, upgrades and downgrades in the loan portfolio, as well as economic uncertainty and so we did increase
qualitative overlays this quarter as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. And then just as a follow-up in terms of your higher cost borrowings, obviously you've been paying
off a lot or running off a lot of those. How much more room do you have? Like what percentage or how much in
terms of dollars are still sort of those less desirable higher cost funding [indiscernible] (00:37:14)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Good question, Ken. What I would say, I'd point you to kind of the remarks that we said. We have really
significantly been able – about $4 billion of wholesale borrowings came off year-to-date because we had a little
over $6 billion of deposit funding.
A couple of points, because most of those borrowings were relatively short, we were able – we didn't really have a
balance sheet that got ballooned, right? A little different than some of the peers that we've seen. We were able to
just, as the deposits came in, have the balances come off.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
If you look at the margin page in the press release, you'll see the drop in balances. But what you also see is the
cost in the quarter of the wholesale borrowing line has gone up a little bit. That's kind of the remaining term debt
that's outstanding. It's on a very low balance at this point, but that's going to be with us.
And so there's fairly marginal room to bring that piece of our funding cost down. Where the real opportunity is, is
what we've been doing the last couple quarters which is the continued downward repricing of our CD book and
getting more and more surgical on deposit costs across retail, commercial, and our municipal business.

Just wanted to start with your expectations on the loan trends going forward. Definitely appreciate your update on
the one-off book and then the New York City multifamily book. Sounds like you did not change the outlook there
at all. But you've got your resi running down as well, maybe $500 million of clip the last couple of quarters. So just
curious what your outlook is from that portfolio's perspective? And then if you expect to see potentially C&I start to
bottom here and maybe grow a little bit going forward? Any thoughts on any of that would be great.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
On resi, on the resi piece coming down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Oh sorry. Yeah. And so we do expect that the resi portfolio will continue to go down modestly over time. And
obviously heavily dependent on pipelines have been very busy and then very active of late. But how long that
continues is uncertain right now. Regarding C&I, my take is that basically what I see with commercial customers
in middle market businesses and consumers actually is a pretty cautious approach to kind of what the uncertainty
that's out there from the pandemic and it's showing itself in kind of a deleveraging and not any kind of push to
expand or take on the next project. So I think there is some caution right now generally out there in taking on the
next new thing until people have a better sense of where things are going from the economy and their customers,
right. So I think that's why our line utilization is down a little bit. I think you see it in some of the national consumer
reports about general demand. So I don't know if you need to get to a point where we have a vaccine but it
definitely has to turn a corner in terms of a more comfort with how things are going economically and from a
health perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. Great. And then I guess just on the resi piece, is there a target you have in mind for concentration where
it's 20% of loans now? And maybe if I could ask that question about the warehouse as well, you had some great
growth there, it's as large as it's been. Can you hold this here with market share gains? Do you expect a little bit
of a downtick there potentially as we go into the slower months? And what your targets are for that piece as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So Dave on the residential mortgage, if you'll recall the Belmont the Farmington transaction, those banks
had over 50% of their loan books where in residential first mortgages. So we had almost 25% of the loan book
post those acquisitions in residential mortgages, not quite as United concentration was more like ours. As you just
referenced we're down to about 20% right now. That's getting in the ballpark of where it's been historically.
Historically we call it 18% to 20%. So as Jack said, I think we'll still see that portfolio come down modestly going
forward. But the pace of decline of $0.5 billion or so each quarter should start to moderate which is what Jack was
saying.
On the mortgage warehouse, I'll just turn over to Jeff.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So if you think of the mortgage warehouse business, it's really grown due to three factors; increased
line utilization with our existing customers. We've been providing incremental credit to our existing customers and
we've had a lot of new customers particularly over the last three to six months. And so as we sit here today, I think
it's likely, I'm not ready to say it's at its peak, but it's getting pretty close. If you think about how much further can
rates go down to continue the refi market that we've been experiencing, that's really what they've been writing to
some extent. So, I think a lot of it will depend on rates but line utilization is pretty high by historical standards. And
12

so, I wouldn't – I don't think it's going to go down dramatically between now and year-end, but I think as you look
out over the course of 2021/2022, it's likely to drift lower.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Got it. Okay. And maybe just one last quick one on the margins. I just noticed that the yield on the securities book
was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, around 2.65%. I know you bought some securities at quarter-end. I was
just curious what the overall yield was on those purchases, and then how you're thinking about managing the
book going forward if you're going to allow it to potentially run off here a little bit if you have to reinvest at lower
rates. Just curious what your thoughts are on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure, Dave. What I would say is the reason that the portfolio yield has held up so well this year is mostly about
the portfolio strategy and composition of the existing portfolio. So, as you remember we have a – we've
historically run a longer duration municipal bond portfolio. So it had a very strong [ph] co-op (45:34) protection in
it. Over the last couple years, we've been moving our mortgage back holdings from MBS pass throughs to CMBS,
again to achieve [ph] co-op (45:47) protection. It's kind of a lesson learned from 10 years ago.
And then in the mortgage backed space, we've always only bought 10 and 15 year mortgage backs. So our
portfolio has held up because of the long duration. And we're not getting those bonds bought away from us for the
most part. But then secondly, because we have very little premium in the pass throughs, so we're not suffering
high levels of premium write off each quarter. It was only up modestly for us just slightly over a $1 million linked
quarter.
You're right that buying bonds at these levels are dilutive to the portfolio yield. Our average purchases in the
quarter were about 1.5%. We were able to achieve that because of the mix of munis relative to mortgage backs.
Our strategy going forward and has been is to reinvest cash flows. We've been doing that not each month but
kind of periodically as rates – as we get opportunities. I think that we'll continue to do that. And then probably in
the next year we'll have more clarity come January. But I think we'll see some modest growth in that portfolio as
well. What would drive that is more asset liability management, right? If you look in the appendix, you've seen our
assets activity move up because of all the deposits that are flowing into the bank. So I think we'll offset a little bit
of that liquidity in the securities portfolio over time.

Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A quick question on fee income. It seems like you like most [audio gap] (00:48:09) the activity levels were
depressed in the second quarter. Anything that you're seeing unusual in terms of that hasn't rebounded yet or
maybe expectations for back end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The big driver has been interest rate swap income for us. That business is really tied for the most part to
new loan originations and then mostly commercial real estate loan volumes, there is some amount because that
book is so seasoned, some amount of two way flow as loans come off. But it's really an origination business. We
had swap income of over $8 million fourth quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2020. It was only a $1.2 million this
quarter. So that's a very large change for us. The $8 million quarters were probably a little inflated but – because
they were record quarters. And the $1.2 million is quite a headwind right now. But away from that one line item,
we really experienced pretty nice fee income, and it was broad based. It was in cash management, it was in bank
service charges, it was in our investment management business as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And if I could ask one more. A popular topic is obviously tax rates. Could you make some comments on
whether you expect the same proportional change in your tax rate if we do get the Biden plan that you saw on the
way down after the 2016 election? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Most likely. We haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about under the Biden plan the impact and quantified it.
But it's a pretty simple exercise once we know what the ultimate tax rates are. But there's not anything really on
the tax side of – that I think would materially – that's materially different now from when we benefited from the
drop. So it should be proportional with [ph] our (00:50:36) expectation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Duong from RBC Capital. Your line is
now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good afternoon guys. I apologize. I've got cut off before so this is a repeat question. But just on the loan
yields, you're at 3.49%, what are you originating currently?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well – so there is a differential between new business going on and the total portfolio yield. That's approximately
25 basis points, call it, to 30 basis points. So, yeah, a little over 3% to 3.05% is probably the aggregate yield in the
quarter. I would say, loan spreads have held up nicely for us in the quarter, but benchmark interest rates came
down a bit as you know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Right. And just historically, are loan spreads in line with where you guys have had them or are they still a
little stretched?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
No, I would say loan spreads have improved, especially in the third quarter. Part of that is – I mean the bad news
in that is we're just not doing enough loans, right. The ones that we are doing, we're getting better spreads on and
a call out to our commercial RMs, we've been able, in this environment, to embed floors in a larger portion of our
loans than we, let's say, year-over-year, our ability is stronger now. So, that's helped a bit as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then just on the liability side, your CD book, where do you think that could ultimately get down to as far
as the costs go?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, that's a difficult question. What I would say is the average CD books for most banks also included [ph] run
(00:53:10) about 11 to 12 months. So you really in a year you've turned the thing over. The issue is just going to
be where you're pricing those roles. We have very successfully this year each month, each quarter been able to
bring CD costs down. There's more to go there but – I said this last quarter, it's the move in lower deposit costs is
getting more surgical than broad based at this point. I mean, we're already down at 29 basis points.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Just turning to, I guess, slide 3, and this ties back to an earlier question on reserving and provisioning
methodology. Because as we look at the reserve to NPLs for a couple of these categories CRE, C&I, kind of
closing in on 100%, how should we think about – how should we think about that because a number of your peers
are well above that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
True. But we're below almost every one of those peers in historical net charge-offs. And you can go back and look
at that for over a decade, and you will see that. So they may be adequately reserved at those higher levels but we
would say we're adequately reserved at our levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Would you be comfortable letting those ratios go under 100%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
If our entire CECL process which means economic environment, management judgment, qualitative overlays, et
cetera warranted that, yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And as far as the deferrals go, the $1.6 billion, I appreciate the color in your prepared remarks. What do
you think is the end game there as the final deferrals kind of roll off between now and year-end? Do you get most
of those back to performing and modify the rest with little breakage? How does that – how do you think that
shakes out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.

the customers, and the circumstance around all the business including the hospitality pieces that are left. The
individual owner operators and based on conversations we have had which is great bulk of all of those borrowers,

Hi, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Just curious on the insurance agency sale, what's the impact to go-forward fees and expenses? And as we
think about the sale itself, was that driven more from a capital management standpoint with the gain, or was that
more from a – was that more done to optimize the P&L and simplify?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So let's talk for a second about the EPS impact. It's incredibly modest. The revenue was about $32 million a year.
It was profitable. Cost base was about $26 million to $28 million a year. And so we [ph] saw (00:58:14) very
strong agency, long term in nature, a lot of long-term producers in the business and very well respected. The
industry has been going through a pretty aggressive consolidation for a number of years now, and the valuation
was very solid and was an opportunity for us, as you suggested, to realize on that long-term investment that we've
made and to put that capital to work elsewhere and grow the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then just turning to the reserve and really the provision, I mean, from all the commentary,
it sounds like you feel really good about the where deferrals are and the conversation with the borrowers there. Is
17

it fair to assume that the reserve built at this point is largely over and that provisioning should reflect more reserve
maintenance at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, it's kind of get back to what David just described in terms of the components of CECL process and in order
to kind of say that you have to be able to predict what the economic and the modeling is going to produce in the
periods going forward and we certainly are not in a position to do that. We have way too much uncertainty right
now.
Where those economic forecasts will come as we roll forward, I think it's still anybody's guess. I mean, we said we
were cautiously optimistic by some of the progress, I think we are cautiously optimistic but we're not ready by any
means to say that the pandemic is − doesn't leave us with a tremendous amount of uncertainty across our
businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then I know we have a number of or a few different portfolios in runoff mode. But just
considering how much has changed in the slowdown in the environment and the economy. Could we see a
change in the thought process around running those books often and maintain the earning assets that you have
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I would say no. So we've been running off that New York multifamily portfolio for a couple of years now, the
transactional New York multifamily. Very good asset yields 3.0%, and 3.25% or so, that's why we haven't sold it
because we're comfortable with it.
And we – I can't see us changing our thought process around the United loans at this point. There are loans from
the get-go that were purchased that didn't fit our business model. So it's hard to think we're going to wake up one
day and say, yeah, we want to grow those types of portfolios.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
