With that, let me now turn it over to Steve.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our second quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are supported by our colleagues
who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the
communities we serve.
Now, on to slide 4. There are five key messages we want to share with you today. First, we are intensely focused
on executing our organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength. Our robust liquidity and capital
base put us in a position to drive growth, and we are investing in new geographies and businesses in addition to
existing businesses. Second, we expanded net interest income, and we expect it to continue to grow sequentially
from the first quarter trough. This outlook is supported by accelerating loan growth and sustained deposit growth
to power future revenue expansion.
Third, we drove fee revenues higher in the quarter with support from our three major focus areas: Capital
Markets, Payments, and Wealth Management. Fourth, we are achieving strong credit performance with stable net
charge-offs, which are tracking as expected for the year. This is a direct result of our sustained and disciplined
approach to credit over many years and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Finally, we believe the net
result of these actions will deliver expanded profitability from here and into 2025 and beyond.
I will move us on to slide 5 to recap our performance. We delivered accelerated loan growth with average
balances growing by $2 billion from a year ago. Annualized loan growth in the quarter was 4.7%. Average deposit
balances also increased, growing $8 billion or 5.5% over the past year. Capital further strengthened with reported
Common Equity Tier 1 of 10.4% and adjusted Common Equity Tier 1 of 8.6% inclusive of AOCI. Liquidity remains
top tier, with coverage of uninsured deposits of 204%, a peer leading level. Credit quality was stable as net
charge-offs improved by 1 basis point from the first quarter to 29 basis points.
We are sustaining momentum in the growth of our primary bank relationships with consumer and business
increasing by 2% and 4%, respectively, year-over-year. Again, this past quarter we seized the opportunity to add
talented bankers. We're pleased to add new deposit-focused capabilities in the mortgage servicing and
homeowners' association, title, and escrow areas. These new teams build upon the prior investments we've made
in the Carolinas, Texas, and three new specialty commercial verticals. As we shared last month, we are bringing
in-house our merchant-acquiring business within our payments organization to further accelerate revenues and
capabilities. As I mentioned, our disciplined positioning of robust capital and liquidity enables our ability to sustain
a growth posture.
Capital continues to increase with adjusted CET1 up approximately 50 basis points from a year ago. Liquidity
continues to be robust, supported by sustained deposit gathering. We were pleased to once again deliver top-
quartile results in this year's CCAR stress test exercise, with Huntington's modeled credit losses second best in
the peer group. Our stress capital buffer was reduced and came in at the minimum level of 2.5%.
Across our markets, we see the broader economy continuing to hold up. Our new initiatives, teams, and
geographies provide growth opportunities even as the broader environment for customer loan demand remains
somewhat muted.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.
Slide 6 provides highlights of our second quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.30. The
quarter included a $6 million notable item related to the updated FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund special
assessment. This did not have an impact on EPS.
Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 16.1% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items,
ROTCE was 16.2%. Average loan balances increased by $2 billion, or 1.7% versus Q2 last year. Average
deposits continued to grow, increasing by $8 billion, or 5.5% on a year-over-year basis.
Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 29 basis points. Allowance for credit losses decreased by 2
basis points and ended the quarter at 1.95%. Adjusted CET1 ended the quarter at 8.6% and increased roughly 10
basis points from last quarter. Supported by earnings, tangible book value per share has increased by nearly 8%
year-over-year.
Turning to slide 7. Consistent with our plan and prior guidance, loan growth is accelerating quarter-over-quarter.
Our sequential growth in loans into Q2 of $1.5 billion was more than double the sequential dollar growth into the
first quarter. This, likewise, drove acceleration of loan growth on a year-over-year basis from 1.2% in Q1 to 1.7%
in Q2.
At our current run rate of growth, 4.7% annualized, we are on track for the full-year plan. We expect the pace of
future year-over-year loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Loan growth in the quarter was
supported by both commercial and consumer loan categories. Total commercial loans increased by $689 million.
Excluding commercial real estate, commercial growth totaled $1.1 billion for the quarter. Over the past year, CRE
balances have declined by $1.3 billion, with the concentration of CRE, as a percent of total loans, declining 1.5
percentage points from 10.9% to 9.6% today.
Even as we have managed CRE balances lower, all other loan balances have increased by over $4 billion, or 4%
from the prior year. Drivers of commercial loan growth in the second quarter included $600 million from new
geographies and specialty verticals. This included fund finance, Carolinas, Texas, healthcare asset-based
lending, and Native American financial services.
Auto floorplan increased by $279 million. Regional and business banking increased by $233 million. In total
consumer loans, average balances grew by $757 million, or 1.4% for the quarter. Within consumer, average auto
balances increased by $436 million. Residential mortgage increased by $199 million, benefiting from production
as well as slower prepay speeds. RV and marine balances increased by $74 million.
Turning to slide 8. As noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by
$2.9 billion, or 1.9% in the second quarter. Total cumulative deposit beta was 45%. Cost of deposits increased by
9 basis points in the second quarter, which matched the increase in earning asset yields. This was half the rate of
change in deposit costs we saw into the first quarter, a continuation of the decelerating trends in funding costs
even as deposit growth increased.
Within the quarter, there was notable further deceleration, with June deposit costs only slightly higher than May.
We are actively implementing our down beta action plan, which is further supported by the robust deposit growth

we have delivered. This position is allowing us to selectively reduce rates and change other terms across the
portfolio in advance of potential rate cuts later this year.
Turning to slide 9. Our cumulative deposit growth since the start of the rate cycle of 7.9% is differentiated versus
the preponderance of peers. We have outperformed by double-digit percentage points on deposit growth over this
time. As a result, we've been able to fund loan growth with deposits, and at the same time, manage the loan-to-
deposit ratio lower over the past year, which will support continued acceleration of lending.
Turning to slide 10. Non-interest-bearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast. Average non-interest-bearing
balances decreased by $280 million, or 0.9% from the prior quarter. This represents a continued deceleration of
mix shift consistent with our expectations. Within the consumer deposit base, average non-interest-bearing
deposits were modestly higher quarter-over-quarter. This was offset by a modest decelerating trend of lower non-
interest bearing balances from commercial depositors.
On to slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $25 million, or 1.9%, to $1.325 billion. We are
pleased to have delivered growth off-the-trough levels from last quarter and believe this inflection in revenues will
continue into the third and fourth quarters.
Net interest margin was 2.99% for the second quarter. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q1, we saw a
decrease of 2 basis points. This was due to higher cash balances with spread net of free funds flat versus the
prior quarter. We continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing, with loan yields expanding by 9 basis points
from the prior quarter.
As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and
interest rate scenarios for both short-term rates, as well as the slope and belly of the curve. Our working
assumption for the second half of the year is aligned with a forward curve, which projects two rate cuts by year-
end. Based on that outlook, we see net interest margin relatively stable over the next two quarters at or around
the 3% level, plus or minus a few basis points.
Turning to slide 12. Our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from
sustained deposit growth. We expect cash and securities, as a percent of total average assets, to remain
approximately 28% as the balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in short
duration HQLA, consistent with our approach to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately
the current range.
Turning to slide 13. As a reminder, our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives: to protect
margin and revenue in downrate environments, and to protect capital in potential uprate scenarios. As of June 30,
our effective hedge position included $17.4 billion of receive-fixed swaps, $5.5 billion of floor spreads, and $10.7
billion of pay-fixed swaps. The pay-fixed swaps, which successfully protected capital, have a weighted average
life of just over three years and will begin to mature over the course of 2025. As these instruments mature, our
asset sensitivity will reduce.
Furthermore, at a measured pace over the past several quarters, we've added more forward starting receive-fixed
swaps with effective dates starting generally in the first half of 2025. The impact of both the maturities of the pay-
fixed swaps and the beginning effectiveness of the receive-fixed swaps will reduce asset sensitivity in a downrate
scenario by approximately one-third by the middle of next year. As always, we will continue to dynamically
manage our hedging program to achieve our objectives of capital protection and NIM stabilization.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Moving on to slide 14. Our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas: capital markets, payments,
and wealth management. Collectively, these three areas represent nearly two-thirds of our total fee revenues.
Within capital markets, revenues increased $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher advisory revenues.
Commercial banking-related capital markets revenues were stable quarter-to-quarter. We expect to sustain and
build upon this level over the back half of the year, supported by robust advisory pipelines in Capstone as well as
expected new commercial loan production.
Payments and cash management revenue was up $8 million in the second quarter and increased 5% year-over-
year. Treasury management fees within payments continue to grow strongly at 11% year-over-year as we deepen
customer penetration. Our wealth and asset management revenues increased 8% from the prior year. Advisory
relationships have increased by 8% year-over-year, and assets under management have increased by 17% on a
year-over-year basis.
Moving on to slide 15. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $24 million to $491 million for
the second quarter, increasing from the seasonal first quarter low. Excluding the impacts of the CRT transaction,
non-interest income increased by $31 million quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to slide 16 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense decreased by $20 million and underlying core
expenses increased by $13 million. During the quarter, we incurred $6 million of incremental expense related to
the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund special assessment. Excluding this item, core expenses came in better than
our expectations for the quarter, with approximately half of the lower-than-expected result driven by discrete
benefits not expected to recur.
The increase in core expenses quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by personnel expenses, as we saw
higher revenue-driven compensation and incentives due to production, as well as the full quarter impact of merit
increases effective in March. We continue to forecast 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. As we look into
the third quarter, we expect core expenses to be higher at approximately $1.140 billion. There may be some
variability given revenue-driven compensation.
Slide 17 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.4%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio,
inclusive of AOCI, was 8.6% and has grown 50 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy
remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth.
We intend to drive adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI, into our operating range of 9% to 10%.
Slide 18 highlights our results from this year's CCAR exercise. We were pleased to once again continue our trend
of top-quartile performance for expected credit losses from the stress test. This year's result was second best
compared to peers. Our SCB improved to the 2.5% minimum and our modeled stress CET1 ratio was the second
best in our peer group. Our ACL, as a percentage of CCAR modeled losses, continued to be the highest level
compared to our peers. These results validate the consistency of our long-standing approach to maintaining an
aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.
On slide 19, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were
29 basis points in Q2, 1 basis point lower than the prior quarter. They remain in the lower half of our through-the-
cycle target range of 25 basis points to 45 basis points. Allowance for credit losses at 1.95% declined by 2 basis
points from the prior quarter, effectively flat and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook, as well as an
increased loan portfolio.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
On slide 20, the criticized asset ratio declined 7% from the prior quarter, driven by broad-based improvements
across commercial portfolios. Non-performing assets increased approximately 5% from the previous quarter to 63
basis points, while remaining below the prior 2021 level.
Turning to slide 21, our outlook for the full year remains unchanged from our prior guidance. As we discussed, we
expect loan growth to accelerate and deposit growth to sustain its quarterly trend. We drove net interest income
higher from its trough and expect that trend to continue sequentially in the second half. Core expenses are well-
managed and tracking to our full-year outlook, subject to some variability given revenue-driven compensation
levels and the timing of staffing adds and expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business.
We expect to exit the year at a low-single-digit year-over-year growth rate. Credit is performing well, aligned with
our expectations.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move over to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Zach, can you expand on your comments on how you're managing downside deposit beta if we get a couple of
rate cuts by year end? I think in the past you've spoken about a downside beta of 20% or so on total deposits.
Can that be a little bit better given that you've been more competitive on deposits in the first half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Manan. Good morning. Great question. [ph] I'll just (00:20:25) elaborate on this one. Well, as I
noted in the prepared remarks, we're already beginning the early stages of the down beta playbook, think –
reducing acquisition rates, shifting the acquisition mix from time deposits towards more money markets, which is

easier and faster to manage on a down beta trajectory, shortening the duration of CDs and making targeted rate
reductions in certain client segments. So already beginning these actions and they benefited us in the second
quarter.
As we look forward, clearly, the performance and trajectory around beta will be a function of what – how the
forward yield curve projects, but clearly what clients and the markets generally believe to be the rate environment.
With that being said, what we're seeing set up now is very conducive to continuing this action and being ready to
actually implement the full down beta playbook when we presume to see a rate reduction later this year. So
there's good confidence on where things are going in terms of that.
It's a little early to give precise guidance here, because clearly, the trajectory around beta over the course of the
first year or so will be a function of those market expectations. But it's our general working assumption that we'll
be in the mid to high 20s-percent down beta range over the first year period and then continuing from there. And
at least that's sort of shaping up pretty well here [ph] in the early days I think. (00:21:53).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, maybe on the loan side, can you talk about how spreads are tracking? We've had several banks
highlighting weaker demand and loan growth, but they're all looking for loan growth. So are you seeing things
getting more competitive and how is that impacting loan spreads overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, look, it is certainly a competitive environment. We're driving growth, as we said, into the second quarter. On a
dollar basis, we saw double the growth into the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter. So the
acceleration that we have been calling for, for some time we're seeing, and so we feel pretty pleased about that.
Part of the question on loan spreads for us overall on a net basis is where are we growing, what segments, what
categories are we growing in? And where we're focused is, is driving growth in a lot of the new areas that we've
been investing in, [ph] and I'll specifically call on (00:22:53) pretty attractive spreads of relative to the average.
I would characterize the spread environment generally is pretty flat on a product and category level. And for us,
really focused on trying to drive capital optimization, obviously, into the areas with the highest return that often
have the spreads, but that also come with [indiscernible] (00:23:13) performance as well.

[ph] I want you to (00:23:24) talk through expected deposit trends for the rest of the quarter. Clearly, you have
outpaced, as you mentioned, [ph] that the (00:23:32) preponderance of your peers [indiscernible] (00:23:35) cycle
in terms of deposit growth. I guess, I got the impression that perhaps some of this deposit growth is prefunding
even better loan growth for the second half of the year.
And I did notice that you [indiscernible] (00:23:48) portfolio, and at that rate that you mentioned that like a good
move relative to the curve. But I'm just wondering, I guess, the question here is, can you continue to – do you
have enough deposit to fund the acceleration [indiscernible] (00:24:04) for or are you expecting to continue to
grow at this pace, but closer to the rate and competitive dynamics that you observed in June? In other words, it
won't be as expensive as plus 9 basis points for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Erika, for the question. This is Zach. I'll take it. Your line was clipping a little bit as [ph] you went on,
(00:24:27) but I think what I heard was what is our, I guess, expectation for loan growth and kind of deposit –
sorry, deposit growth, I'm sorry, and deposit pricing here in the back half of the year. And will we have enough to
fund [ph] loan (00:24:46) going forward and what the kind of rate trajectory is around that. So let me see if I can
address that. And if I haven't covered it, you can follow up.
Look, I think we're really pleased with how things are going on [indiscernible] (00:24:57) for sure. If you take a big
step back, 15% outperformance versus the peer median over the course of the rate cycle with a beta that
compares pretty favorably to both history and peers. So really did well. And what that's allowing us to do is, to
your question, pre-fund to some degree of future loan growth, and we've seen [ph] this (00:25:18) loan-to-deposit
ratio just last year go from 84% this time last year to 81% now in the quarter we just closed.
So sort of sets up that ability to fund with core deposits, the accelerating loan growth that we expect. But also, I
would note and this sort of goes back to Manan's question a second ago, it gives us a lot of flexibility to really
manage down beta, and to be selective and disciplined in terms of where that next unit of funding will come from.
So that is sort of the intention. And it's sort of performing really well. I mean, to some degree [indiscernible]
(00:25:52) we're actually outperforming our initial budget on deposit growth. It's one of the reasons why we
elevated the deposit growth forecast up to the high-end of our initial guidance range.
I think we saw an extraordinary level of growth into the second quarter of almost $3 billion. I don't expect that
same level of sequential growth into the second quarter, but I do expect it to grow and I would see some nice
sequential growth into the fourth quarter, too, and to be within that overall guidance range of $3 billion to $4 billion
for the full year. So I think that will allow us to kind of absorb the increased lending volumes that we're projecting
in core fund [indiscernible] (00:26:29) to manage down beta.
In terms of pricing strategy, let me sort of go back a little bit to the answer I gave to Manan, which is we're being
judicious, we're still in acquisition mode, but we're very much cognizant of our position of strength and that can
allow us to execute the early stages of our down beta. So we're seeing it in the marketplace, reductions in go-to-

market acquisition pricing. We're likewise doing that and taking that opportunity, and I believe that, if we do get
rate reductions here in September, which is – seems to be a certainty based on the market expectations, we'll be
able to continue that and to drive it forward even further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. And just as a follow-up question to that, as I try to put together everything that you've told us about
deposit pricing trends, continued fixed rate asset repricing, and the swaps that are maturing, while you started the
year having a generally asset-sensitive position, the way your balance sheet will evolve into next year, it sounds
like in terms of both strategically in pricing and mechanically in terms of some of the financial engineering rolling
off, you will be set up to potentially benefit from that rate curve or lower short rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. [ph] So let me sort of (00:27:59) address some of the thinking around NIM trajectory, asset
sensitivity plans. The objective we have vis-à-vis asset sensitivity management, over the last year, year-and-a-
half even, has been to allow our national asset sensitivity to really maximize the value of the [ph] uprate
(00:28:19) environment, which works pretty well.
Clearly, now, as we think about rates topping out, and then, presumably, beginning to fall, we are strategically
reducing asset sensitivity. And in the prepared remarks, I highlighted the combination of increasing forward
starting receive-fixed swaps and expiration of pay-fixed swaps will reduce that sensitivity by about a third between
now and the end of – I'm sorry, the middle of next year, and [indiscernible] (00:28:47) dynamic in managing that.
But that's a very intentional reduction in asset sensitivity to manage in the presence of reduced rates.
I think [indiscernible] (00:28:59) generally seeing pretty stable trends here over the next several quarters. And
there are two [ph] substantive (00:29:07) positive factors that we've discussed over time. Fixed asset repricing will
continue to benefit the NIM. Second factor, hedge drag, about 16 basis points of net hedge drag in the second
quarter that we disclosed. So that will go down to almost a neutral position by the middle of next year in an
implied [ph] forwards area (00:29:28). So we'll get some benefit from that pretty steadily here over the next
several quarters.
The other two factors that are very [indiscernible] (00:29:36) clearly are what happens with variable yields, what
happens with interest-bearing liability costs. But, in our expectations, you'll see an accelerating and an effective
down beta that will help to mitigate variable yield reductions. And [ph] net of the things, we have a (00:29:54)
pretty flat NIM here. I think over the longer term, we do see [ph] some of these (00:29:59) opportunities to drive
NIM higher [ph] gaining (00:30:02) more upward curve – upward sloping yield curve environment. And that is, I
think, what the market is expecting, pretty positive about where NIM will go over the long term, how should we get
through this initial stages of downrate.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Morning, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start – maybe Zach, for you. So if we do get two cuts this year, say, September, December, Zach, what's
your bias as it relates to the NII outlook, the [ph] down 1% to down 4% (00:30:45), where in the range you think
we'll lead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. Our [indiscernible] (00:30:54) where we think our basic trend is going, and we're generally
trending pretty well in the middle of that range, and that's including a couple of cuts there. I do think that a lot of –
one of the key factors in managing a flat NIM will be that continued execution on reducing the trajectory of
interest-bearing costs rising, and then begin to driving them lower.
And, of course, the real ability to do that is a function of what the competitive environment is, and what customers
believe the [ph] rate path is, and so depending on (00:31:32) the conviction of the market and the economy
broadly where the rates are going. But that being said, the data does continue to set up pretty good confidence for
where the forward yield curve will go. And so feel pretty good about our ability to do that.
So the other element of that clearly is loan growth. And we're seeing really encouraging signs there. Pipelines
look strong, solid performance in Q2, we expect to continue to grow and accelerate on a year-over-year basis
here in the back half of the year. I think we could see even faster loan growth in some of our new growth
initiatives perform even better than they're forecasted to do in our base plan. Pipelines there look really good. And
so [ph] it pulled through (00:32:20) even better than our base plan and we see some upward bias on loan growth.
Likewise, [ph] what we haven't addressed in (00:32:25) the Q&A section here is we did see more CRE runoff in
the second quarter than we had had expected in the kind of initial budgeting, to the extent that that is lower going
forward, we see higher loan volumes and that could lift revenues above the base plans; conversely, if any of
those factors [indiscernible] (00:32:46) the lower end, but feel pretty good about [indiscernible] (00:32:51).

That's the base plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour Q
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
That's your base plan. Okay. That's helpful. And then, it's funny, when we look at slide 7, you're calling out the
$600 million. That was the increase in average loans for new initiatives, right? I don't know, call it, $2.5 billion a
year. And I'm curious because that you could look at that and say, well, that's sort of a catch-up. You have new
bankers and new verticals bring over their books. But then you're saying momentum is building. So would we look
out from here, we think about that $2.5 billion run rate or so. Do you see upside to that? As the quarters roll
forward, should we see more contribution from new initiatives in a dollar perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No. I think I'm expecting to see very strong performance in these new initiatives. We're really pleased with how
they're doing. Every one of them has both – customers is booking loans. We're seeing good performance on
forward relationship in terms of deposits and fees starting to come through. So really pleased with it. And I also
wouldn't characterize it necessarily [indiscernible] (00:34:02) with deep experience in their industries and those
geographies we've launched in, and we're just sort of driving through new client acquisition on a pretty core basis.
The trajectory of growth that you highlighted, I expect to see a pretty steady build from here. I don't know. I can
see acceleration per se, but the trajectory [indiscernible] (00:34:25) very accretive to loan growth.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. So I think my question is on customer – overall customer
demand and loans have sort of been answered. But I was hoping you could maybe address auto in particular. I
noticed production is as high as it's been in the last several years. Is that sort of maybe being used as a flex given
sort of the softer overall growth than you had anticipated, maybe earlier this year.
And albeit within the context of it sounds like things outside of that category are going to advance more robustly
later on. So just curious how you're thinking about auto. And then, as a follow-up, maybe just sort of quality of that
portfolio, given what the kind of fluctuations we've seen in used car values, slower economy, et cetera.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Scott, this is Steve. I'll take the question. And on – business has performed very well this year and in the second
quarter, we expect it will continue. We're not using it as a buffer. I think that was essentially what you were asking.
We just see it as a terrific opportunity. Some of the other banks in the last year or so pulled back on auto. It's
created a bit of an opportunity for us and we'd expect to continue generating significant volume and growth. As
you saw, [ph] with the CRM (00:36:00) and as we've done in the past with our securitization. We manage
aggregate exposure with the book, but we've got quite [indiscernible] (00:36:08) at this point.
In terms of the quality of the book, it's a super prime book. And so very low defaults. And we've talked about this
for years. We focus on default frequency. On the margin, the used car pricing can have a slight impact on
incremental loss or avoided loss on each repossession, but it's not going to be a big number for us either way.
We've shown that this book performs very well over the years. We expect it will continue to do so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Zach, maybe one for you just on cost. Appreciate sort of the third quarter
rise that then sounds like we're still on track for the full year. In the past – I don't want to get too detailed on next
year, but you've sort of talked about that normalization of overall cost growth into next year. Any change sort of
broadly to how you're thinking about that, or are we still, sort of, on track for that as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
On track for that is the headline answer there. We feel really good about how we're managing expenses for the
year. There's clearly been little bit of timing delta from where we would have initially expected to where we are
now. But the full year looks quite in line where [ph] we would have (00:37:30) thought initially and in line with our
guidance.
[ph] What I'll say now (00:37:34) is as we've discussed on previous calls, a steady deceleration in the rate of year-
over-year growth as we go throughout the course of this year. I think [ph] expense growth (00:37:45) last quarter
was about 5% year-over-year. [ph] It's like (00:37:48) around 6%, I think, effectively in Q2 that we just closed.
That will trend toward the low-single-digits by the time we get to the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. And
our expectation is we'll see that run that trend down into 2025.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...Zach, I'm not sure if I missed it. Just talk to us around the loan-to-deposit ratio 80%. Do you expect that to stay
as is? The guidance kind of implies that. But as we think about all this loan growth coming up, should we expect
the loan-to-deposit ratio to stay flat like that's where the banks are going to be managed and talk to us also about
the mix of these deposits that are coming in. If you can talk about like blended rates or what the NIB mix of these
deposits is, that would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Great question. I think that we're really pleased with how we're doing on deposit gathering, and to
some degree, it's prefunding loan growth that we're expecting to continue to drive higher gear over time. And so I
would expect over the course of a longer time period like we see the loan-to-deposit ratio drift back higher again,
but [ph] it seems to be in a (00:39:19) pretty tight range.
The objective we've got [indiscernible] (00:39:21) over time is to grow deposits very similarly to loans, and the
delta would only be kind of temporary as we see trends on a relatively short [ph] time basis might need to
(00:39:32) diverge. So on the back half of this year, I'm expecting to see maybe slightly faster sequential loan
growth and deposit growth, it's not so meaningful [indiscernible] (00:39:43) that ratio very much.
Fundamentally, what we're seeing in terms of deposit growth is the same function we've been seeing for the last
several quarters. Underlying acquisition of new relationships is quite good. We talked about 2% primary bank
household growth in consumer, 4% business bank, commercial also growing a lot of new names and new
customers, particularly within our new growth initiatives. And also, importantly, a couple of the new verticals we've
added very much focused on deposit gathering, which is very much helpful. [indiscernible] (00:40:18) the mix of it,
as I noted in one of the earlier questions is actively shifting out of more time into more money market that sort of
[indiscernible] (00:40:26) driver from here, which will help us set up the ability to move beta down at a faster rate
going forward. And all that's going to contribute to just that sort of slow progression of topping out deposit costs
and then bringing them back down in that decelerating [indiscernible] (00:40:47) and then accelerating on the way
down as we've discussed. That's sort of what we're seeing at this point.
In terms of non-interest-bearing, I don't think I've gotten any question on it yet, but I think in materials you can see
the chart where that's going. We're seeing a meaningful deceleration of that mix shift out of non-interest-bearing
into the first quarter to give you a sense from the fourth quarter, $1.3 billion reduction in non-interest-bearing into
the – second quarter, we disclosed only $300 million of reduction in non-interest-bearing and in fact consumer
went up. So, we think we're almost done here in terms of mix shift out of non-interest-bearing and this will
[indiscernible] (00:41:29) in the near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned expenses will be low-single digits, if I heard you
correctly, by the end of the year. Does that – should we be reading into that in terms of 2025 expense growth
being higher, lower, or same as 2024?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, the thing with – great question, Eb. The point we've been discussing I think for a while in terms of expense
growth, this year 4.5% was intentionally higher than what we would otherwise [indiscernible] (00:42:03) running at
so that we could invest in some of these new growth initiatives and also importantly, invest a lot of data and
automation capabilities throughout the company. But that that pace of growth would reduce as we went into 2025
and that is our plan. I expect to see lower growth rate of expenses in 2025 than I saw in – what we're seeing in
2024. And the sort of the trend is very much supportive of that because by the time we'll exit this year, we'll
already be exiting at a kind of run rate of year-over-year growth that's quite low. So, try to maintain that lower
growth rate as we go into 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, Zach has shared in the past efforts to lower growth rates in core expense levels of the bank in order to
continue to invest in different opportunities, revenue-producing opportunities primarily. You should expect to see

There's been some coverage about it, what you've done and some others in the media and I guess, I'm just trying
to figure out the logic. I mean, you've got strong capital, you're building capital, I realize you've got kind of the
strong loan growth outlook. But the rate that was kind of put out there in the media seems pretty high for what's a
very high-quality auto book as you show in the slides here. So, just trying to understand kind of the logic of that

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Yes, great questions. This is Zach, I'll take that one. If you take a step back [indiscernible] (00:44:03) capital
plans, we put these transactions in the context of the overall capital plan. The plan is really twofold, drive adjusted
CET1 higher. We were 8.6% adjusted CET1 in the second quarter. We intend to drive that up into our operating
range of 9% to 10%. I think we're just a handful of quarters away from achieving that, our [ph] current (00:44:25)
trajectory. And then, the second key objective is fund high-return loan growth and we're doing that. And I think, as
we said that will continue to accelerate on a year-over-year basis. And then, the primary driver of creating the
capital to support those objectives is organic earnings and the core earnings power of the company. And that
really is the core focus, the prime focus.
With that being said and just shifting now to your question on CRT and CLNs, at the margin these transactions
can be very helpful for just further RWA and balance sheet optimization. And so, we're pleased that to do a CDS
transaction in the fourth quarter last year and then a very successful credit-linked note transaction in the second
quarter. To give you a sense of the economics in the second quarter, yield was exceptionally good, less than a
3% cost of capital.
So, what I mean by that? $4 billion notional transaction against high-quality indirect auto loans, 74% reduction in
risk-weighted assets through the transaction, so $3 billion reduction in RWA. We also get almost $500 million of
funding from the transactions and the cost of that is only $7 million into spread on a year-one basis, plus modest
upfront transaction costs. So, it's incredibly efficient at the margins unlocked 17 bps of CET1 and just continue to
support those prime objectives. So, we look at it as very much tactical. It's not the core underlying driver, but just
these opportunistic things that come through and really pleased with that [indiscernible] (00:46:14) although the
economics are incredibly favorable.

Well, our pipelines go out a couple of quarters and so, we have visibility through – not full visibility, but partial
visibility through the fourth quarter. We don't yet have significant visibility into 2025. Certain businesses, though,
because of the nature of their relationships, our distribution finance, we tie back into the supply base and we get
some insight from them as to what they intend to produce. But on the whole, we don't have significant multi-
quarter visibility, Jon.

So, credit [indiscernible] (00:48:01) continues to perform very well. We're very pleased with the performance year-
to-date, the outlook looks good. As you know, we spent a lot of time on portfolio reviews and management and it's
looking good. So, there'll be some lumpiness in commercial real estate over the next couple of years for us and
others in the industry. But outside of that, looking good. And on the whole, for us, it's not going to be an issue. As
you know, our CRE concentration continues to reduce. So, I think we had a little over $250 million of office
payouts over the last six quarters. The hack with construction unused commitments have been absorbed. So,
books in – the CRE book's in good shape.

...good morning. You guys had a nice rebound in fee income and then you've got the merchant acquiring coming
on back in-house starting in the third quarter, which I think adds about $6 million to fees. Just do you think fee
income that you can continue with this momentum and kind of maybe come in at the upper end of that 5% to 7%
range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Peter. This is Zach. I'll take that one. So, would share your [indiscernible] (00:49:35) fee
income performance was very strong. We were really pleased with what we saw. The second quarter was up 6%
sequentially from the first, continue to run at a 5% year-over-year growth rate similar to the first quarter year-over-
year. And our expectation is to land within our 5% to 7% full-year range. As we get into the back half of the year
and we've got some of the grow-overs versus last year [indiscernible] (00:50:01) easier.
With that being said, I think we'll continue to power sequential growth here and it really is the three priority areas
of focus; Capital Markets, Payments, and Wealth Management. Execution quality is very strong and the trends
we're seeing continue to be very much conducive to that. Payments up 5% year-over-year in Q2. Treasury
management within that double-digit growth, driven by client concentration. Wealth Management continues to run
at very strong levels. Our performance advisory, households up 8% – AUM and net flows look really good and
that's driving revenue of 8%. And in Capital Markets, which clearly has been a little bit choppy in the back half of
last year, we were pleased to see what we would expect, which was strong growth in the second quarter,
particularly in our advisory business, where we know that the middle market M&A has been in a challenging
environment as yields were – as interest rate environment was rising last year, activity is now picking up and I
think will sustain. So, I'm expecting sequential growth in each of those areas. I think where we land in the range
will be clearly a function of how well we perform in it, but strong confidence we'll get there.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then, just last question just on credit, I mean, as you talked about credit trends are really good. If I look
