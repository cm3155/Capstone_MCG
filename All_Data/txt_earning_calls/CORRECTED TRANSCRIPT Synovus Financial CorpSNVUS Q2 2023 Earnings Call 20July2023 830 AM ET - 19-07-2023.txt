Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Cal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call.
Before we get into our results, I'd like to sincerely thank Cal for his tremendous contributions over the last two
years, serving in his Investor Relations role. Cal has been instrumental as we've all navigated through the
economic highs and lows, with his strong background in market analytics and credit. He's guided us well, worked
hard to strengthen relationships, and built even greater trust with all of you who cover us and the investors you
stand for.
We are thrilled to welcome Jennifer Demba to the team, bringing her vast industry knowledge and sell-side
perspective into our strategy, setting, and shareholder activities. Her extensive financial services background will
be incredibly valuable as we move through the current cycle, as well as execute on our strategic plan. So thank
you, Cal, and officially welcome Jennifer. We couldn't be in better hands with the two of you in your new roles for
our company.
What you'll see today is financial performance that remains quite strong with PPNR of 8% year-over-year and an
adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18%, despite a slowing economic environment and tighter liquidity
market, which led to another quarter of contraction in our net interest margin. We continue to see evidence that
our relationship-based model serves as a strong platform to attract and retain talent as well as clients. Our team
member turnover is the lowest it's been in many years, engagement levels are high, and we continue to add talent
in key revenue producing and corporate services areas.
From a client perspective, deposit production remained strong with second quarter levels over 130% higher
compared to the same period last year. While loan production remains muted versus last year, commitment levels
increased 4% versus last quarter and second quarter adjusted fee income is up 10% versus the previous year.
And while you'll see shifts in some of our expectations for the year to adjust to the trends we're seeing internally
and externally, we also still strongly believe our success to-date as well as our path forward is the result of our
intentional approach to expand our business, diversify our client base, and gain share of wallet, all while
increasing our investments in innovative solutions to further enhance the client experience and sources of
revenue.
We have also quickly responded to the changing economic environment and the recent industry headwinds, to
better manage the emerging risk. Over the course of the year, we have increased our CET1 ratio by
approximately 20 basis points, reduced the percentage of deposits that are uninsured, increased contingent
funding sources to $26 billion, and reduced the midpoint of our expense guidance for the year by 3 percentage
points, excluding the impact of the Qualpay transaction.
Our bank has made significant strides in recent years, paving a path forward towards achieving our long-term
financial goals. While pursuing growth opportunities and maximizing profitability in this environment, we remain
committed to optimizing our overall risk profile. By implementing robust risk management practices, closely
monitoring market trends, and adapting to regulatory changes, we aim to ensure the stability and resilience of our

operations. Our dedicated team strive to strike a balance between growth and risk management, fostering a
culture of prudence and innovation that sets us on a trajectory of sustainable success.
Now, let's move to slide 3 for the quarterly financial highlights. When looking at the same period in the previous
year, revenue and PPNR grew at high single-digit rate, supported by strong operating metrics which linked
quarter saw revenue and PPNR headwinds as a result of increased deposit cost and NIB remixing, leading to
margin contraction. Loans increased $309 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter. As we saw in the first quarter, this
growth rate declined from prior year levels, as we continue to experience lower loan production due to client
demand and our increased emphasis on returns and relationship-based lending.
After seasonal tax-related outflows in April, core deposits increased modestly and ended the quarter roughly flat
with the first quarter. Much like the rest of the industry, we continue to see pressures from non-interest-bearing
deposit remixing, as clients have increased their use of their operating funds, thereby further reducing average
balance per account.
Our underlying credit performance remained solid; and although our credit metrics are experiencing some
expected increases as a result of the current environment, overall credit trends are healthy and we have not seen
meaningful change in the underlying performance of our borrowing base or stress focused in any particular
industry or asset class.
Lastly, as I've stated previously, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position, as we navigate
through the uncertain environment. And with the CET1 position ending the quarter at 9.85%, we are well inside of
achieving our objective of exceeding 10% CET1 by the end of the year.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the second quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to begin with loan growth, as seen on slide 4. Total loan balances ended the second
quarter at $44 billion, reflecting growth of $309 million. As Kevin mentioned, new production and overall growth
have slowed, as new fundings are focused on customers with more broad-based relationships.
Similar to previous quarters, CRE growth was a function of draws related to existing multifamily commitments and
a low level of payoffs. On the C&I side, the slight decline in balances was driven by lower utilization and exit of
certain syndicated loan-only relationships. Lower C&I utilization is a positive credit signal, reflective of the health
of our overall borrowing base.
In the current environment, we are rationalizing growth in areas that have a lower return profile or don't meet our
strategic relationship objectives. On that note, in July, we signed an agreement to sell a $1.3 billion medical office
CRE portfolio. This transaction is expected to result in a onetime negative net income impact of approximately
$25 million in the third quarter and reflects the exit of a business that maintained pristine credit quality despite not
meeting our long-term strategic criteria.
Turning to slide 5. Deposit balances remained relatively flat for the quarter. Core deposits saw a modest increase
after April seasonal declines. And despite a more tempered outlook, we continue to expect deposit growth
through the remainder of the year. Supporting this growth are seasonal tailwinds, along with targeted deposit
efforts including deposit specialist hires and focused industry vertical initiatives.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Looking at the composition of the quarterly change in balances, non-interest-bearing deposits were down $1
billion quarter-over-quarter, a byproduct of the aforementioned seasonality from tax payments, cash deployment
of excess funds, and continued pressures from the higher rate environment. As in the first quarter, the decline in
MMA was largely impacted by a shift to other products, in particular the CDs within our consumer customer base.
As we look at deposit rates, our average cost of deposits increased 51 basis points in the second quarter to
1.95%, which equates to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 37% through Q2. Our deposit costs and betas were
impacted by the anticipated pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposits, as well as the decline in non-interest-
bearing deposits. We expect those same dynamics to play out in Q3, with deposit pricing lags continuing albeit at
a slower pace given the FOMC's slower pace of tightening and with some further decline in non-interest-bearing
deposits as a percent of total deposits.
The result is further pressure on our expectations for through-the-cycle total deposit betas, which we now
approximate will end the year in the context of 46% to 48%. Last quarter, we included statistics on our liquidity
position that detailed our level of insured deposits and contingent liquidity sources. These figures have been
updated and are available in the appendix to this presentation.
Now to slide 6. Net interest income was $456 million in the second quarter, an increase of 7% versus the light
quarter one year ago, and a decline of 5% from the first quarter in line with our previously disclosed expectations.
The asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from both higher balances and rates. Though as in the
first quarter, higher deposit pricing and remixing within our NIB deposit portfolio offset those gains, resulting in
overall NIM compression. As we look forward, we expect Q3 NIM to continue to contract at a pace similar to that
in Q2, followed by some relative stabilization thereafter as deposit pricing lags and NIB remixing slowed. Against
those diminishing headwinds should be the gradual benefit which accrues to the margin from fixed rate repricing,
which has a compounding effect and should support the margin through time, assuming this higher rate
environment remains.
Slide 7 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $111 million, down $7 million from the previous quarter and
up $10 million year-over-year. The primary variance in quarter-on-quarter fee income was due to the extremely
strong first quarter for capital markets, which normalized as expected. That said, despite lower overall
industrywide transaction volume, the current level of capital markets income reflects the benefit of strategic
investments in our CIB and middle market banking platforms. As we step back and look at the overall levels of
durable core client fee income, excluding mortgage, the investments across our franchise and products and
services continue to bear fruit.
Over the last four years, we have compounded core client fee income at nearly a double-digit pace, as we
continue to invest in valuable revenue streams such as treasury and payments solutions, capital markets and
wealth management. Also of note in the second quarter is the closing of our Qualpay investment, which we
announced last year. The go-forward impact is expected to have an immaterial impact to consolidated net income
and is reflected in our guidance for the full year.
Moving to expenses. Slide 8 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $301 million, down $4 million from
the prior quarter and up $17 million year-over-year, representing a 6% increase. We are very proud of the team
for our prudent expense management in a challenging operating environment. Where production volumes have
declined, we have implemented head count reduction strategies and discretionary spend has been reduced
across the organization. In addition, as we have said before, our incentive plan alignment allows for expense
flexibility in times when revenues are under pressure. We will continue to operate with heightened expense
discipline in the near-term and adapt our expense base to maintain a competitive overall efficiency ratio.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Moving to slide 9 on credit quality. Overall, credit performance continues to perform in line with expectations, as
evidenced by the relatively stable life of loan loss expectations in the allowance calculation. As we saw last
quarter, the 2 basis points increase in the allowance was a result of modest deterioration in the forecasted
economic outlook. The quality of our originations remain strong and the impact of a few credit downgrades were
offset by improvements in the performance of the aggregate loan portfolio.
As we look to the second half of 2023, we expect credit costs to remain manageable, with expected full year
charge-offs of 25 to 30 basis points, reflecting a second half charge-off range of 30 to 40 basis points. We
continue to have confidence in the strength and quality of our portfolio. We do not see any specific industry or
sector stress within our loan book and we will continue to apply our conservative underwriting practices and
advance market analytics to both new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management.
As seen on slide 10, our capital position continued to grow in the second quarter with the common equity Tier 1
ratio reaching 9.85% and with total risk-based capital now at 12.79%. Our organic earnings profile supported
capital accretion in Q2, which along with a somewhat slower pace of loan growth, was more than sufficient to
offset marginal headwinds from the consolidation of our Qualpay investment. As we look ahead, we remain
focused on eclipsing the 10% CET1 threshold, at which time we intend to reassess the broader macroeconomic
environment and consider what actions, if any, may be prudent as we diligently manage our capital position to the
interest of all stakeholders.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. Now, I'll continue with our updated guidance for the quarter. Before we review the details, it's
worth noting that outside of loan growth, the ranges provided do not reflect the impact of the impending FDIC
special assessment, nor the impact of the medical office CRE sale as the transaction is yet to be settled.
As you can see on slide 11, the changes in the operating environment that have impacted the industry over the
last 90 days are reflected in our revised guidance. Loan growth is now expected to be 0% to 2% for the year. This
reduced guidance is due to lower anticipated production volume, as well as the impact of the expected medical
office CRE sale. Despite lower demand and a higher hurdle rate for new business, we continue to have growth
oriented lines of business such as middle market and CIB, which we expect to produce strong second half growth.
We expect core deposit growth to increase 1% to 4%, driven by the previously mentioned seasonal tailwinds and
new growth initiatives. The adjusted revenue growth outlook of 0% to 3% aligns with an FOMC that reaches a
target rate of 5.5% and holds through the end of the year. Changes to the revenue guidance are the result of
lower loan growth expectations and overall deposit betas, which are now expected to reach 46% to 48% by year
end. We expect 4% to 6% expense growth in 2023. While the environment has resulted in some strategic shifts in
priorities, we remain confident in our growth strategies, including Maast and CIB, but have applied additional
discipline across the entire expense base to better manage levels of growth. Over the course of the year, we have
significantly reduced our guidance range. And when adjusting for new growth initiatives as well as uncontrollable
environmental costs such as FDIC and healthcare, our core expense base is expected to be flat to up 1% year-
over-year.
Moving to capital as we previously communicated, we are targeting a CET1 ratio above 10%. At this time, we
continue to believe it is prudent to build a larger capital buffer and we intend to continue to build capital levels

through year end through the retention of organic capital generation and slowing balance sheet growth. Lastly, we
expect our full year tax rate to be near the midpoint of our previous guidance range of 21% to 23%, supported by
new federal tax investments, which will go into effect in the second half of the year.
Our commitment to agility and responsiveness will be instrumental in navigating the ever-evolving landscape. As
we continue to focus on growing tangible book value, we also recognize an opportunity to right-size our balance
sheet for sustainable, profitable growth. Our medical office transaction announced this quarter is an example of
diligent balance sheet management optimization efforts, where we free up capital and liquidity to pursue higher
returning, more expandable relationships. As we move forward, we remain steadfast in our dedication to
managing expenses and leveraging other strategic measures to perform optimally in the current environment. By
staying adaptable and resilient, we are confident in our ability to achieve sustainable growth and to deliver value
to our shareholders, customers and communities alike.
And now, operator, let's open up the call for Q&A.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Let's start on the updated revenue guide. Hi. So the environment is tough, I don't know if it's that much tougher
than we thought it was a quarter ago. What's really changed to drive the revenue outlook moving down to the 0%
to 3% range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steven, this is Jamie. Thanks for the question. As we look at the revenue outlook for 2023 compared to
what we said in April, it's really two different components. On the asset side, you have a couple, some positives.
We expect spread revenue to remain high and that going on spreads to remain at these elevated levels. But we
do have the impact of lower loan growth and some of that is environmental due to the economy. And part of it is
due to the sale of that medical office CRE portfolio. On the liability side of the balance sheet, you have the impact

of further deposit mix headwinds and that's really due to the decline in non-interest-bearing deposits that's above
prior expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, Jamie, to follow-up on that. So basically indicating NIM down about the same amount in
the third quarter, but then leveling out. So should we think about this, really the NIM should bottom in the third
quarter, and then maybe be flat to up pass that. And what are you assuming for non-interest-bearing, is that mix
shift basically done once we get past the third quarter also? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We do expect, as you said, the margin to decline in the third quarter, a little less than what we saw here in the
second quarter. And that does include continued remixing of the deposit base with further declines in NIB to total
deposits. And we've tried to look at it in multiple ways. It's a hard thing to model given everything that's going on
that's kind of outside of our control. You think about the exogenous factors of the Fed balance sheet and rate
tightening and trillions of dollars in stimulus in a GDP growth environment. And so we try to look at history and
determine where it's going to go. Unfortunately, the prior tightening cycles don't give us a lot of insight. The mid-
2000 is probably best, but it still wouldn't imply declines like what we're seeing right now. And I think a lot of that
has to do with diminishment.
When we look at the cash flows of our clients and using the same analysis that we've spoken about in the past
about credit, we see that our client spend is the growth in it is declining. And we think that our clients are being
managing their cash flows. And so we do expect to see some of that diminishment slow as we go through this
year. But we do expect to see declines heading into year end. We expect about another 3% decline in NIB to total
deposits, and perhaps if rates stay high, a little more decline, maybe another percent in 2024. But that's how we
are thinking about that mix. But it's probably one of the more uncertain pieces of the model as we look forward.
But we're just trying to be conservative in how we look at it. Make sure that the guide we give is pretty clear in that
regard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. So even with a sustained remixing, there's no benefit coming from the fixed assets repricing that NIM
should be relatively stable in 4Q, is what you're saying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's right, that's right. And so let me talk about that for a second. As we look at the margin, you'll see the
decline in the third quarter. And then you're right. We do expect relative stability, but the benefit of fixed rate asset
or exposure repricing will come through. And here in 2023, it will likely be offset by the tail end of this deposit cost
increase and then you start to get the benefit in 2024. But just to put numbers on that. In any given month, we
expect approximately $250 million of fixed rate loans to paid off or pay down.
And when you look at the impact of that, as you go forward, looking forward about a year, there's about an 11
basis point impact to the margin a year from now just due to the fixed rate loans repricing, and that's mortgages
plus commercial loans. So, we have that tailwind and that's excluding the benefit of securities which have a little
bit slower pay down and hedges. And we have another $1 billion of hedges that mature in the first quarter as well.

So you're right to point out that that is a tailwind and that's what we'll start to see in 2024. And we believe that
that's going to be the platform for growth as we look at revenue going forward.

is now open.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So maybe just a little more color on why you guys are exiting the medical office space. I heard the comments on
the call about how it's a low return business. Maybe just a little more color on what made that a low return
business for you all and a little more color on why you made that move?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, thanks for the question. First, we are extremely pleased with this transaction and the performance of
the team that built this business. The pristine nature of the credit in this portfolio, the medical office CRE portfolio,
was evident really throughout the diligence process and it led to the strong pricing that we have on this portfolio.
But to your point, this portfolio performed exactly as designed and it was a great asset for the bank in a zero
interest rate environment where a high single-digit ROE was accretive.
But in this environment, with much higher interest rates, our return requirements are a lot higher. And as a part of
all of our more broad balance sheet optimization efforts, we determined that this portfolio was one that was not as
core of a fit, given that it has very low relationship value even though it's pristine credit, but a high single-digit
ROE.
And so, it helped us achieve a few of our key strategic objectives. First, it accelerates the timing to our capital
objectives that we believe position us really well for growth going forward. Second, it improves our liquidity profile
and it helps increase our core deposit funding percentages. Third, these capital and liquidity benefits will really
give us the platform for growth going forward.

And it also reduces our CRE office exposure. The cost of this, I mentioned high single-digit ROE, it's really about
a 2% spread is the way to think about it, and that'll be a headwind to us in the near term. But longer term, we're
convicted that we can go and build and grow core clients' deep relationships that offset and exceed the lost NII
from this portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the $25 million burden, if you look at that on a pre-tax point of view, I think it's only like 2.5% of
the loans being sold. So, that's a pretty minimal loss there. But I was wondering what was the reserve on that
portfolio, that reserve probably gets wiped out. I'm just wondering what the overall loss was on selling those loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, we will put all that out there at closing. But you're right to think that that's a net number. And so, we
do feel good about it, is a little less than the 2.5% you mentioned. But it's a net number and we will put out all the
details of the economics at closing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just finally, it's great to see Qualpay close. I know that's probably beneficial to Maast. Can you
just remind us the benefit that that has on Maast? And with that business now closed, does your outlook for Maast
change at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Brady, Qualpay is the front end for our payment facilitation platform so that we can process payments through the
Maast platform. And so, we've been very clear that having a majority ownership interest in Qualpay allows us to
ensure that the capital that's provided to our platform is their number one priority. So, it is great to have it closed.
It has a minimal impact to our P&L, but it has a big impact as we continue to expand the capabilities and
functionalities of Maast.
When we started this program a little over a year ago, what we said is we would get into 2023 and we would start
to pilot with a couple software vendors. Well, we're up to three partners that are onboard today, and we also have
five others that have signed on. So we'll have a total of eight that will be on the platform, with five additional
software vendors in the contract phase today. So, that could take us to as many as 13 software vendors that are
signing onto the platform.
So, I think we've confirmed our initial hypothesis that Maast would be a product that is highly desirable by these
software vendors, just based on the interest and the individuals that have signed up to this point. But I think it's
premature to talk about what the revenue is going to be from those software vendors, because we're still finalizing
the MVP product and that will be rolled out more broad-based at the end of this quarter to all of those eight
software vendors that have signed up.
And then the final stage, which will determine how fast the revenue grows, will be the end user adoption. So,
those clients that are using the software, will they leave deposits on the platform, will they sign up for the money
movement capabilities and eventually the lending capabilities? But having Qualpay finalize ensures that a big

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the earlier conversation about kind of balance
sheet trends around the non-interest-bearing. I know that's really hard to predict in this environment. But you did
note that average balances have declined a little bit. I'm curious if you have some more detail around that, what
those average balances look like now, maybe to pre-COVID and kind of how we can think about the room for
potential normalization there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes, Stephen, it's a great point, and to Jamie's point, there's so many variables that go into determining what the
terminal level is going to be with non-interest-bearing. If you look at our consumer operating accounts, the
average balance declined about 9% quarter-on-quarter, and that puts it back at about 10% higher than where it
was prior to COVID. And if you think about those balances on an inflation adjusted basis, it would lead you to
believe that we're largely back to where we were pre-COVID.
On the commercial side, we saw about a 7% decline quarter-on-quarter in average balance, but they're still about
30% higher than they were pre-COVID. So you can look at that in two different ways. Number one, I do believe
that we've been increasing the average size of our deposits in commercial just based on our middle market and
CIB strategy. So the production that we've had since COVID has brought on larger deposits, so I would expect
that the average deposit to increase. Two, I think our clients are carrying extra cash, especially as we enter
uncertainty in this economic environment. So some of that will stick. But three, it would lead you to believe there's
probably still a little excess cash that's sitting on our commercial operating account balances, and you could
continue to see some diminishment there. And that's why I think Jamie, when he went through our analysis for the
rest of the year, we would expect there to be a little more decline in the percentage of total deposits in NIB.

sustaining your clients is different. But we get all these questions about regional banks won't be able to make any

money, the whole business model is dead. Can you kind of give us some color on why that's not true and kind of
what has changed or what hasn't?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, I'll tell you what hasn't changed is our value proposition to our clients. And Stephen, when you go back
to last quarter, when we talk about being recognized by J.D. Power as being the number one bank in the
Southeast for client service and trust, I think it gets back to the heart of why clients choose banks and the primacy
that we bring to the table. They want folks that provide great service and they want advice, and we're going to
continue to provide that. I think what gets lost in all of this is what's happening today is just a contraction in
margin. And unfortunately, in our business, we're not like manufacturing. When we get an increased cost for our
cost of goods, we can't just pass that on to the clients. A lot of our loans are already on the balance sheet. And so
having a little bit of margin contraction is not something that's new to this industry. It's been happening over the
last really 20 years. And so I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary. I don't think regional banks are
experiencing any greater margin contraction.
Obviously, the big banks have a little bit of a advantage as it relates to scale and funding. But I think when we get
through this next quarter, as Jamie just talked about and margin stabilize, we're right back to where we started,
which is who's going to win market share, who's going to grow. It's those banks that are providing the best level of
service. They're providing the client experience and are winning market share. And I think we were doing that
before, and I think we'll do it again on the other side.
And the contraction story will be one that's kind of one of history. The other question mark that I think's out there
is credit. So when we get to the other side of whatever this cycle is and we prove out the credit cycle, and I've
said from day one that I feel like there's going to be winners and losers in this environment based on where your
portfolio sits, what geography and what asset classes you're in. And so when we get through that side, you hear a
lot of the rhetoric that regional banks are carrying a lot of the CRE and a lot of negativity there. So between
margin contraction and the credit story, I think that just has to play out and it feels like it is playing out and we get
to the other side, we'll be back to one of growth story and client primacy.

Good morning, Kevin.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Was just hoping, one thing I noticed was in your prior guidance slide, you addressed PPNR growth and you don't
have that in this slide. Is that simply because it's sort of implied that that's going down with the revenue guidance,
or did you want to address that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's right, that's right. I mean, we – by giving the expense guide, the revenue guide, it's implied. And also it's
just – there's so many different iterations of what can happen between those two line items that we didn't think it
was as useful as it was last quarter.
But I do want to – while we're talking about PPNR, I want to speak for a second about expenses, because our
expense guide is important to us. And when you look at kind of how we've progressed through this year on
expenses, we started the year with a guide that was a lot higher than where we are right now, is 5% to 9%. And
as we think about the growth there in the very beginning of the year, we started to read the tea leaves, look
forward, and see that the environment was deteriorating.
And so we started cutting back on our initiatives, cutting back on our spend, and that led to the reduction in the
guide last quarter. And then you see the reduction in the guide this quarter. And when I say reduction, it looks like
it's the same. But we're also including the approximate $10 million impact of Qualpay to the expense line this
quarter that was not in the guide last quarter. So we feel good about that component of our guide especially,
especially when you take into account that about 5% of expense growth comes from growth initiatives and then
other environmental costs like the FDIC increase this year and healthcare costs. And so that's something that we
spend a lot of time on working on our expense base, being efficient, and I think that's an important part of the
story when you think about PPNR year-over-year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
So, Jamie, when you're – so you're saying that 4% to 6%, it's staying the same, but this bullet point over – this
assumption over to the right of the new initiatives, FDIC and healthcare costs and these other core operating
expenses were not necessarily in the prior guide, but you're finding ways to offset it, is that what you're saying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
No, no, no. I'm saying that what was not in the prior guide is the 1% impact of Qualpay. The other growth
initiatives were in the guide in January as well as the guide in April. But what I would say on the growth initiatives
is those initiatives have been trimmed down a little bit individually and in various ways as we progress through this
environment. And so the spend on both Maast and CIB is a little bit less than what we guided to in January. But
the only change in those spends from April was really just the Qualpay addition.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Understood. Okay. And one quick follow-on, some banks are talking about or that are evaluating potential bond
transactions where you would take some kind of upfront loss, but then you would be able to put those proceeds to
work at higher rates and or pay down debt. I would suspect that with your goal of getting to the 10% CET1, maybe
that's not something that's near-term until you get to that point. But is that something you guys are evaluating and
in over what timeframe? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a great question. As we look at our bond portfolio, first off, in aggregate, the duration and the paybacks too
long to consider a transaction like that. And you're right and you can see this through our MOB transaction. It's
our intent to accrete capital at the moment. We remain really excited about with the opportunities that's in front of
us in the Southeast to drive client growth. And that's our highest and best use of capital. And so we're not that
interested in realizing a loss in the securities portfolio to mark the yield-to-market at the moment.

Just following up on the loan sales, the participations in the medical offices, is that the end of loan sales at this
point? And what are the uses of funds for these, from the proceeds or should we just assume that the – that
wholesale FHLB is paid down or what's the use of funds there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We're not anticipating further loan sales. Truthfully, that's not something that we would anticipate in normal course
of business outside of the third-party portfolio. Typically, in an – especially in an environment like this, the best
course of action for a business that may have a lower return than what you're targeting would be just to let it attrite
and that would be a normal course of business is let the loans pay off at par and move on and free up the balance
sheet that way. And that's the traditional way to exit a high performing business like the medical office. That was
just a unique one that the credit quality was so pristine that we were able to get what we believed was a very fair

price for that portfolio. And with regards to the use of bonds, you're right, it will go to pay down just more
expensive funding, whether that's FHLB or broker deposits, it will likely be one of those two.

And that $25 million that you call out, that's net of the paydowns or that's just the $25 million hit from losing the

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it, got it. Okay. And then on credit, as we look at the trends with the expectation for higher net charge-offs
going into the end of the year, what's driving that higher levels of expected loss? And as we sort of flip the
calendar into 2024, is that trend – do you expect that trend to increase and continue going into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jared, this is Bob. Just as Jamie mentioned, I mean you're going to see a slight drift up in charge-offs
and in credit metrics in general within – and again, we would expect that. The drivers are not anything systemic.
It's just a pressure that our clients continue to feel. And some of them with more leverage are certainly feeling it
more than others. But that will push charge-offs and non-accruals slightly up. We certainly increased this quarter.
That was a just a couple of credits that happened to fall in the same quarter. We don't see it coming from any
specific industry or any specific asset class, but we do see just general credit pressure.
I don't like the term normalization, but certainly in the environment we're in, we should expect credit to kind of
ease up as it relates to the credit cost in total. And that's what we saw and that's what we expect to see in the
third and fourth quarter. We've done a lot of deep dives into these portfolios and really feel good about our guide
of sort of 30 basis points to 40 basis points in the back half of the year. Coming off a very low, pretty low base in
the first half, still landed us in that sort of high 20s, 30 basis points or so for the year. As far as 2024 is concerned,
we'll get more specific on that in January as we talk about our guidance. But I mean, the general feel is, overall,
it's kind of more of the same, at least in the near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And when you look at that allowance ratio tied in with that going up a couple of basis
points this quarter, so is that still sort of marching higher? Or given the expectation, the broader economic
expectations today that that's maybe a stable level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we look forward, clearly, we think we're adequately reserved today, feel good about the allowance. I
would point out that embedded in the allowance this quarter, we do have a 20% weighting to that stagflation
scenario which is pretty onerous. We don't show 2025 economic data for that forecast.

But unemployment rate starts to approach 9% at the end of that forecast, which is a pretty high number. And so,
that's embedded in our allowance this quarter. As we look forward, could we see it continue to increase slightly? I
think that that's fair, but it could also remain at current levels and it would just be dependent on the economic
outlook and the portfolio performance.

line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I had more of a bigger picture question on credit just based on your conversations with clients.
What impact have 5 percentage points and more of higher rates had on middle market and small business
balance sheets? And what do you think their appetite is to absorb these interest costs if rates stay higher for
longer through 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Manan. This is Bob again. Overall, we do a commercial client survey and I'll point
to that first and we've been doing that for several quarters now. And that survey gives us a lot of good data points.
And what it's generally telling us is that, our clients are starting to feel marginally worse about the future
expectations of their business, but not materially.
So, it's in keeping with this inflation rate being higher. It's in keeping with their cost and input cost being higher
longer and some potential pressure on their revenue line. So, we certainly are tracking that. That matches up with
what Cal and his team are doing with our cash inflows and outflow analysis and that algorithm.
So, we've got a lot of data points. Generally speaking, we think there is some pressure, particularly on smaller
businesses, as they just don't have the access to the capital that a larger credit would. As it relates to middle
market, I mean, certainly, it depends certainly on the industry and the effects of COVID or the longer-term effects
of what COVID may have on those industries.
But overall, it's just general margin pressure that we continue to see in a slightly worsening environment that we
expect it to kind of continue as long as we stay at this level. That's what our surveys are telling us. That's what our
analytics are telling us. And anecdotally, that's what our discussions with our clients are telling us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And then Bob, just to add to that. When you talk to clients, I mean it obviously has had an impact on pipelines
going into this year. We're down, but we've seen a stabilization of pipelines. So, it feels like the reduction in
demand that we saw in the first quarter has stabilized. And you think about some of our clients who have been
able to pass on that higher cost on to their clients. And that's what we've seen through much of the cycle. The

challenge becomes, to Bob's point, is when you have increased input cost and you no longer can pass that price
increase on to your clients.
And given where inflation has been and given the consumer and the health of the consumer, I think we're getting
to a point where it becomes harder and harder to pass it on. And so, I think that leads to lower demand. But
ultimately, it leads, as Bob said, to lower margins. But in general, if you look at it kind of a through-the-cycle, many
of these small businesses and commercial clients still look very healthy as it relates to their historical returns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then separately, I know you don't fall in the category of banks that regulators are most focused on for
new regulation. But I'm assuming that the supervision process will get guided for banks of all asset sizes. So,
noted your loan sale this quarter and your comments that you want to keep accreting capital at least for the near
term. But in terms of the overall balance sheet and capital and liquidity, are you doing anything else to prepare for
the tighter regulatory environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
There's nothing else that we are working on right now from a capital and liquidity. I mean, think when you look at
our strategic plan, what you'll see is, we will be building capital and improving our liquidity positioning. Now, we
feel very comfortable with our liquidity where it is right now. You see $26 billion of contingent liquidity. But we also
believe that we can improve the positioning and reduce the overall cost of our funding as well. And that's
something you'll see over the next couple years. And so, that's just going to be part of our strategy, part of our
strategic plan.
If you look at the leadership team that Kevin has built here – the leadership team, especially in the corporate
services, there's a lot of large bank history. And you think about what's coming down the pipeline to $100 billion
and higher banks, most people here have lived that, breathed it, and we know what it takes. And so, it's already
part of our nature. It's part of how we manage the bank when we look at scenario analysis, we look at risk
management. It's how we manage our day-to-day. So for us, that's not – regardless of the change officially, it's
not a big change in how we operate day-to-day.
The only thing that I would say that is a debate for us and it doesn't impact us is the potential impact of AOCI on
capital for the banks over $100 billion. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. But if indeed how the
maturity is excluded from that, then that's something that we will have to consider is, how do we leverage
[indiscernible] (00:49:53) maturity designation, because it's not something that we use today.

Good morning, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So I wanted to talk about the core deposit guide and just wanted to get your expectations as far as what kind of
percentage contribution do you expect from seasonal benefits versus the new deposit initiatives?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, it's true, Brandon, that when you look at the fourth quarter specifically, there's usually seasonal inflows,
both on the public fund side as well as generally the commercial side. So I think it's 50/50. What we said to this
point is that we've been focusing on new deposit production. Our production on a year-to-date basis is up 183%
over where it was in 2022. We believe that will continue. And yes, some of that has come in our CD promotions
and the like, but it's really up across all of our lines of business.
Number two, we continue to focus on the blocking and tackling, which just means that we're using analytics and
sweat equity to reach out to existing relationships to ensure that we have a full share wallet. We talked earlier this
year about changing incentive plans to align the bank's interests with our relationship managers, and we think that
also pays dividends and will continue into the third and fourth quarter. We've onboarded a new liquidity product
specialist, who will focus in kind of the large corporate middle market space and bringing in larger deposit
opportunities. And we'll continue with some of our promotions that we have out there today.
So seasonality is something that we are counting on, but it's not the only reason that we're growing. We think that
the other half of the story is really around the production that will continue into the second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. And with the new deposit initiatives, just could you give us kind of a big picture view strategically on how
you think that will play into potentially next year as far as being able to drive deposit growth, maybe higher than
what has been historically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, it will definitely be higher than it was this last year, I can tell you that. Because with all the
diminishment that we've had that Jamie talked about earlier, our story is not one of production. It's been a story of
diminishment. And with all these excess balances sitting on the balance sheet, it's hard to overcome the reduction
in the average balances. And I think as we've talked about that abating, the production will obviously be much
more impactful in terms of growing deposits.
And so what we'd love to be able to see coming out of the other side of the diminishment story is a production
level that closely mirrors that of loan production. So to Jamie's point, we believe that we can reduce our wholesale
funding in the coming quarters. And we feel very good about our loan-to-deposit ratio today, which is under 90%.
And going forward, if we match our deposit growth with our loan growth, we feel very good about not only the
margin impact of that, but ultimately, our ability to continue to fund our growth story as we look into 2024 and
2025.

Got it. Okay. So that's probably SOFR, I guess, at this point. Okay, cool. And then just on, I appreciated the slide,
I think it was slide 6 or so. I think you had tucked in the repricing dynamics on the fixed rate portfolio. I just wanted
to focus in on the non-mortgage portion. That 2.3-year duration, is that a good cadence to use in terms of even
repricing from the fixed rate loan perspective, or is there any kind of chunky periods of fixed rate loan repricing
within there?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
There's no real chunky portions of that. It's actually fairly steady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, okay. So that should just be consistent repricing going forward. All right. Cool. And then I just wanted to
sneak in one last one. Just on the deposit outlook, I think on one of the slides, you said that you expected I think it
was 46% to 48% total deposit beta range through December 2023. So that kind of calls for a bit of a step up in the
back half. I was just wondering how competition is evolving in the Southeast markets, especially now that FHN is
back, fully competing for deposits with everyone?

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So Brody, let me take the competition, I'll let Jamie talk about the betas. So it was interesting, when we go back
and look at our competitive data in the second quarter, what we saw was for the first time that we've been tracking
this that we had multiple banks that had CD promotions that were higher than the brokered rates. And I won't
mention the names, you know who they are. So that did drive up the cost of promotional CD production.
Number two, when you look at the change in the standard rates for just money market both on the consumer and
on the commercial side, we saw on average about a 90 to 95 basis point increase in standard rates in the second
quarter. If you compare that to the first quarter where we actually saw more rate hikes, it was only up about 45
basis points. So what we saw in the competitive landscape was a 2x movement on standard rates in the second
quarter. And I think that's what's driving a lot of the deposit beta discussion.
But I'll let Jamie talk about our forecast. A big piece of that is the NIB remix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's right, that's right. I mean, as we think about deposit cost movements from the month of June that you see
in our presentation to the end of the year, we do expect to see a fairly steady, just monthly step down in the rate
of increase of total deposit cost. And so that's how we think it will play out. And you'll see that steadily decline sort
of approach zero at the end of the year. And Brody, to your prior question, I'll point back to an answer I gave
earlier about the – on the fixed rate loans, that's the $250 million that we have each month that is maturing or
paying down this repricing.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you. As we close today's call, let me thank everyone for their attendance and obviously your interest in our
company. I am pleased with our bank's performance and it remains very strong, despite the challenges posed by
the slowing economic environment, higher cost of funding, and the tighter liquidity market. I think we've
demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of these headwinds and we are proactively adjusting and
fine-tuning our activities to navigate the evolving landscape.
To ensure we have sustained growth, we've undertaken some short-term balance sheet optimization measures,
reduced our expenses and grown our capital levels, all of which will enable us to return to our strong growth story
over the long run. We also continue to show the health and strength of our borrower base as our credit
performance to-date and our view into the future reinforces my belief that our diversification, our prudent
underwriting, and our strong footprint will differentiate us in this cycle.
While we acknowledge the current market conditions and the subsequent contraction in our margin, we want to
emphasize that the underlying growth story of our bank has not changed. We firmly believe in the long-term
potential and value that this institution offers, not only to our customers but also to our clients – our shareholders.
We understand that our team members are driving force behind our success and that their dedication and
enthusiasm are crucial to delivering our exceptional service to our clients. As such, I was extremely proud of the
results of our voice of the team member survey that we received just this week, which revealed a team member
engagement and favorability that ranks us in the top 5% of the industry. That statistic reaffirms our commitment to
fostering a workplace that attracts and retains top talent.
And as I shared last quarter, our client service levels remain best-in-class with services like J.D. Power and
Greenwich affirming as much with their recent awards. The client experiences and the result that trusting
relationships that are created translate into sources of growth as we deepen the wallet share of our existing
clients, and it serves as a referral source to attract new ones. As we navigate through the current environment, we
remain focused on taking actions that will mitigate the pressures on returns, while maintaining our commitment to
our customers, our shareholders, and our employees.
We will continue to prioritize prudent risk management, operational excellence and strategic investments to drive
future growth. I am confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves in the competitive landscape, but
also in the long-term growth potential of the bank and remain committed to delivering value to all of our
stakeholders. Thank you again for your continued support and we look forward to the future with confidence.
And with that operator, we'll close today's call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. This now concludes the Synovus Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now
