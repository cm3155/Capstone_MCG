Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. TriState Capital delivered a very strong financial result in the second
quarter, as each of our businesses made meaningful contributions to our top and bottom lines. We believe
TriState Capital Bank's 35% organic loan growth, annualized from the linked quarter, will be truly exceptional
relative to peers and the industry. And our Chartwell Investment Partners business also delivered differentiating
organic growth with double-digit annual growth in assets under management in the quarter to a record $11.5
billion.
Collectively, our loans, deposits and assets under management reached an all-time highs. This growth helped us
to generate record levels of quarterly revenue; pre-tax/pre-provision net revenue, pre-tax income and net income
available to common stockholders. Additionally, net income available to common stockholders grew by some 78%
annualized from the linked quarter and 86% from the second quarter of 2020.
We also delivered earnings per share of $0.41, growing EPS even with a higher share count and preferred
dividends from our December 2020 capital raise, continuing our record of efficiently and effectively putting new
capital to work through the responsible and meaningful growth of this company. In addition, all this quarter
earnings growth was achieved solely through organic means and with continued modest provision expense.
What makes these results possible and what differentiates this company from competitors, large and small, is our
people. We now have more than $23 billion in on-balance-sheet assets and client assets under management, as
our team's impeccable reputation for client service expertise and results continue to attract new business and
grow existing relationships.
Revenue per employee, a metric you've heard us highlight regularly, was $678,000 in the second quarter on an
annualized basis. This is more than twice the level that the median $10 billion to $20 billion asset bank generated
based on most recent quarter data. Our agile business model combined with our culture of valuing each
individual's contributions and focus on building the best team has driven our collective performance at this level.
We're expanding our scalability and responsiveness through further investments in technology designed to
support our people and enhance their ability to provide best-in-class service to our clients. We are investing in our
client engagement experience and offerings to position us for enhanced market share profitability, all while
maintaining our operating leverage. We believe these investments will, in turn, support continued earnings growth
and long-term value creation for our shareholders.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Following its breakout performance in the first quarter, Chartwell has done everything but slow down. Assets
under management of $11.5 billion and annual run rate revenue of $39.9 million at June 30, 2021, each reflect
growth of more than 20% from one year prior. In the second quarter, our asset managers' strong performance
attracted continued positive net flows. Products like Core, Core Plus and short-duration BB-rated high yield are
attracting flows from new and existing institutional and retail clients seeking enhanced yield with a focus on credit
quality and interest rate sensitivity.
The combination of asset and revenue growth that we've achieved at Chartwell is further supported by
incremental improvement in operating leverage, as we continue to benefit from past initiatives to moderate
Chartwell's segment expenses while continuing to invest in new products, marketing and distribution. Year-to-
date, investment management fees have grown at 20% year-over-year, while expenses have grown at almost half
this rate, generating significant operating leverage.
We are particularly proud of the Chartwell team's ability to grow revenues at this clip in the current rate
environment, with fixed income representing some 60% of total assets under management. We are thoroughly
focused on continued organic growth. Chartwell's new business pipeline began the third quarter with more than
$65 million in unfunded institutional commitments.
We are also investing in product development, including a new Chartwell short-duration, high-grade bond fund.
This new product leverages the talents of our fixed income team and serves as a complement to our very
successful short-duration, high-yield strategy, which has grown to represent more than 25% of AUM. Chartwell
sees significant retail and institutional demand for this new short-duration product. We have total confidence in
our fixed income team's abilities. And the sales and distribution team is motivated to bring it to market.
Meanwhile, TriState Capital Bank grew total loans by more than 29% over last year, and nearly 9% during the
quarter to $9.3 billion on June 30, 2021. That's annualized growth of 35%, lending to very high quality clients and
the differentiated and attractive markets we've served for years. This exceptional growth continues to be driven by
private banking loans, which grew to some $5.7 billion or nearly 62% of total loans at the end of the quarter.
That's because these loans which are collateralized by marketable securities, cash value life insurance policies
from select issuers and other liquid assets are an excellent and timely solution for many high net worth borrowers
across all economic and market cycles, especially the current environment.
With a referral network of 292 financial intermediaries, including independent financial advisers, trust companies,
family offices, broker/dealers, regional securities firms and insurance companies, we expect to continue
dominating market share and driving formidable growth in this business moving forward. Additionally, private
banking loan application volume is up 43% from the second quarter of 2020 and reached a new record level. We
expect continued growth, although we continue to focus our origination efforts on where we can deliver the most
meaningful benefits and experience to borrowers and their advisors.
Commercial loans totaled $3.6 billion at June 30, 2021, up 15% from one-year prior and 2% from March 31.
Commercial real estate loans grew nearly 16% annualized, while totaling just 25% of total loans, as we continue
to partner with what we believe are some of the highest-quality and most experienced sponsors in our markets.
Commercial and industrial lending was down from the linked quarter, as new originations and draws on lines of
credit and growth in equipment finance production were offset by amortization and paydowns. This activity in the
C&I book is reflective of seasonal trends and temporary supply chain dynamics, but we are optimistic about the
second half of the year. Both our CRE and C&I portfolios remain well diversified, have grown solely by organic
means and have strong pipelines.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Our private banking business, which made up 61.5% of total loans at the end of the second quarter, as well as the
high-quality nature of our commercial banking relationships, continue to favorably impact our asset quality metrics
and credit costs. Credit quality has long been a differentiator for TriState Capital, and we further improved our
metrics in the second quarter. We reduced adverse-rated credits by some 33% compared to the linked first
quarter.
On our $9.3 billion book of loans, we reported just $34 million of adverse-rated credits or 37 basis points of total
loans. Nonperforming assets totaled 12 basis points of total assets and net charge-offs were just 10 basis points
of average total loans. Importantly, the second quarter charge-off activity was previously reserved for in prior
periods.
Our significant loan growth allows for improved profitability and deployment of liquidity, which continues to be
readily available and inexpensive. Our team has done a tremendous job with liquidity management, ensuring that
we are managing against excess liquidity by timing our pipeline and putting our liquidity to work in high-quality
assets. Deposit growth during the second quarter fully funded our loan and investment growth, with record
deposits of more than $10.2 billion at quarter-end, reflecting 30% growth over the last 12 months and 10% during
the quarter.
Treasury management deposits doubled from June 30, 2020, and now make up 22% of total deposits. We're
excited about our continued addition of meaningful and long-term client relationships. These deposits support our
efforts to effectively manage deposit costs, which we reduced by 6 basis points during the quarter. This, in turn,
contributed to our third consecutive quarter of net interest margin expansion, up another 4 basis points from the
first three months of the year.
Second quarter 2021, NII grew to a record $42.9 million, up 28% over the second quarter of last year, marking
TriState Capital's 22nd consecutive quarter of annual net interest income growth This is the result of the high
quality and robust volume we're achieving, particularly in private banking. We currently view responsible volume
growth as the primary driver of net interest income expansion in 2021, as we position for favorable profitability
when rates do rise.
NII was complemented by record noninterest income, driven by our strong investment management fees and
solid swap fees during the quarter. Excluding securities gains and losses, NII and noninterest income combined to
generate record quarterly total revenue of $57.7 million. This reflects an increase of 10% from the linked quarter,
where 41% annualized, which we believe will further differentiate TriState Capital's latest results from similar-
sized peers in industry overall.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on measuring our performance through operating leverage and growing
revenue at a faster clip than operating expenses. Our expenses were in line with our expectations and reflective
of investments we're making in people, technology, clients and the products.
Against the backdrop of the challenging economic environment, we showed what our company is capable of.
Loans, deposits and total assets each crossed significant thresholds during the quarter, surpassing $9 billion, $10
billion, and $11 billion, respectively. We are enhancing net income consequentially in a low interest rate
environment, driven by our penetration of niche markets, our well-positioned distribution capabilities and high-
quality client service delivered by motivated professionals who are focused on effective execution. This company
has reached critical mass, providing it with the flexibility to continue investing meaningfully for the future and
providing impactful earnings to the bottom line on a consistent basis.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
We enter the second half of the year with strong confidence and healthy pipelines across all three of our business
lines. For year 2021, we remain keenly focused on: Growing each of total revenue loans and deposits at 15% to
20% rate over 2020; managing the annual expense growth to a low-double-digit rate; continuing to generate
positive net asset inflows and expand segment profit margins at Chartwell; and continuing to grow net interest
income dollars, all while maintaining our hallmark superior asset quality.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now ask the operator to open the lines for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this point, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator

question.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start with kind of a high-level question, Jim. The deposit growth and really improvement over the last
few years has been really notable. And I guess, my question is, as we look ahead, I mean, obviously, the rate
environment is hard to predict. But I mean, I think consensus outlook seem to be factoring some rate hikes at
some point, the next 24-ish months.
And curious if you guys just have any high-level thoughts on how the deposit portfolio might perform in that type
of environment relative to your performance in the past? I mean, it seems like the relationships are a little bit
stronger over the last few years with some of the hiring efforts that you've made. And then, obviously, the banking
environment as a whole is a bit more digital now than it was four, five years ago. So, just curious if you guys have
any high-level thoughts on how – or expectations about how that might perform, if we do get into some type of
rate increasing environment?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Michael, let me make a couple general comments, and then I'm going to turn it over to Brian Fetterolf, who's the
CEO of our bank. What you're seeing is the results of some 15 years of really focusing on each aspect of this
business. And it's been coming to fruition slowly over the period of the years.
And what you want to keep in mind, as I mentioned almost in every single one of these reports, that we've put
highly experienced, sophisticated individuals in place, and they've, for us, on the liquidity side built a very
sophisticated funding mechanism, and it's working. And we can control the flows that come in place through the
relationships we have in place.
And if you were to look at the turnover that we have of our relationship managers, it's almost nonexistent in that
regard. And these are people that had a great deal of experience in their prior life and were leveraging off that and
seeing the results today in these numbers. So, I would suggest to you that better times are yet to come. Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Jim. Tough to follow that last statement there. But, yeah, I would agree with Jim's
characterization that we're looking forward very optimistically. We are in – as Jim mentioned, we've built it over 15
years. You can look at the last two years, in particular, to see the diversification of that growth.
Treasury management, obviously, as we pointed out, has doubled in the last year. And that's just one segment.
But, obviously, service-based deposits being a key piece of our forward-strategy; relationship deposits being the
broadest piece. And as Jim indicated, the people that we've brought in have those key relationships. And, again,
keep in mind that this is a national deposit-gathering capability. So, we think that, that provides us a huge scale.
But we are super focused right now on being there meaningfully for existing clients to grow with them. And we are
seeing our existing clients grow and attracting new clients as well.
And with the technology investments we're making, again, we look at this as very timeless technology
investments. The obsolescence is low, which allows us to continue to build better and better service, capabilities,
products for clients. We're attracting new clients the fastest rate we ever had. But to your point, we are building for
two years from now in our deposit pipeline and portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Helpful. And then, this is my follow-on question. Maybe a question for Jim or Tim, just on Chartwell.
Revenues are up nicely quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. I mean, if the market cooperates, is it fair to think of this
business as kind of a high-single-digit revenue growth type business at this point, with all the investments you
made? And can you just remind us also what the M&A landscape and appetite is [ph] if any, on your (00:22:04)
business at this point as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Michael, let me comment with regard to your question generally, and then I'll turn it over to Tim. I take you back to
March of 2020. And the condition of the market drove Chartwell's assets down to $7.7 billion. We determined at
that time, Tim and myself and a lot of others, that we were going to solely focus on bringing Chartwell back from
that level.

And now, as you can see today, it has $11.5 billion. We've been hugely successful. And I would see us, at some
point, as we go into the new year, of being much more aggressive in that market. There's a lot of opportunities
that are available there, but we wanted to get our own captive infrastructure back in shape and breathing strongly.
And I think you can see by the flows, the net income it's delivering, the revenue growth, that it's having an impact.
Tim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Joseph Riddle A
Managing Partner & Chief Executive Officer, Chartwell Investment Partners LLC
Yeah, Michael. First of all, good morning. We're certainly captive of the market environment, as you well know,
but we would certainly expect, with the exceptional results that we've been able to achieve, particularly on the
fixed income side and with the unique type of products that we have available to both the institutional and the
retail market that again, revenue growth, as you had indicated, is certainly something that we believe is
achievable, not only in the second half of the year, but going forward as well.
And as Jim indicated, we're solely focused on organic growth of the franchise, and we'll continue to look. But,
obviously, in this environment, there could be an opportunity that presents itself, and we would be open to that,
but we're certainly not leading with our chin. Our job is to grow Chartwell organically.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to follow up on your balance sheet growth commentary. I think you reiterated what you've said in the
past, about 15% to 20% growth for loans and deposits this year, if I heard that correctly. Looks like loan growth

TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.

already about 13% and deposit growth already 20% for the year. Is that just conservative commentary, or you
think that you're expecting a slowdown in the second half there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. This is Brian. Hey, Danny. We, I would say – I mean, obviously, year-over-year, our third and fourth
quarters last year were pretty impressive quarters as well. So, we'll probably look at it from an average balance
perspective and the spot. But, overall, we remain optimistic on the second half. The second quarter and the fourth
quarter, more seasonal.
Historically, those have been, sort of, our strongest quarters. So, we're not surprised that second quarter
performed so well. But I think we indicated even last quarter that we would expect to be at the higher end of that
15% and 20% range. And that looks like that's where we're going to be able to pull through.
We continue to be optimistic on the private bank side. We're seeing a sort of very strong market acceptance. And
sort of our distribution and our internal client engagement efforts continue to grow that. So, we don't see any
slowdown there in the commercial side. And we think we'll take up a bit as we indicated between the supply chain,
loosening on the equipment finance and some fund finance aspect. So, still think 15% and 20% is a right place to
direct us. But at the top-end of that would be the right place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe for Dave. You talked in the past about the NIM expansion getting up to the mid – to high-
1.60s by the end of the year. We've seen, obviously, some pressure on the 10-year. Just wanted to see if that's
still how you're thinking about it in the current rate environment, or if you need rates to rise from here to get back
to that mid to high-1.60s?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer-TriState Capital Bank & TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
No, Danny. We still believe that. As we've long said, we're more focused on net interest income growth through
sort of reasonable and risk-managed growth in loans and investments; building durable relationships and
matching liquidity with their needs, as we build the franchise.
We were pleased that we're able to expand NIM in the quarter. And we see that expansion continuing for the rest
of the year, primarily be driven by deposit cost reductions. As we manage deposit balances in line with the
opportunities for deploying that liquidity, we believe that we'll be able to achieve further cost reductions in that
category as we continue to grow deposits. And as we've shared with you at the beginning of the year, we would,
again, expect that the NIM will be somewhere in the mid to high-1.60s by year-end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. It might be a good place to add real quickly, just from tenure perspective. Certainly, it's a metric that we
watch, but we think that, again, if you roll it over to the swap revenue opportunity, we've demonstrated we can
9


TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
(TSC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
work with the swap market, and all markets, and all rate curves: flat; steepening; and inverted. But yeah, we're
pretty happy with where the tenure is right now. It gives us a lot of opportunities. Our clients are super engaged at
these levels.
So, we think that we – in some respects, the stock sometimes trades obviously with the industry and around that
tenure because of everybody's exposure to that. We would say, we have more opportunities in that kind of
environment. So, obviously, that's separate from the NIM question. But from a revenue perspective, we're happy
where we are. And obviously, it's good for Chartwell as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to discussion around deposits. And as you mentioned, the banks made
tremendous progress lowering deposit costs and really growing the treasury management business. And I expect
we'll see more of the benefits of that with higher rates. But I guess, given the floating rate nature of TriState
assets, I'm curious what the appetite is at this point to start considering locking in some longer-term funding on
the liability side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer-TriState Capital Bank & TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Matt, good morning. We certainly talk about that regularly. It's something we're looking at evaluating, but we've
not done anything at scale yet. We continue to be quite pleased with the treasury management growth. Those
balances are 20% of our total deposits now, which we just started that business four or five years ago. So, we'll
certainly continue to look at that in an effort to drive total return to the shareholder. And we'll update you with any
strategy we employ on a go-forward basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
And I think I would just add to that. Obviously, we look at the deposit portfolio as an opportunity – I mean, it's
obviously a way to fund the lending part of our business. But again, just take a brief outtake for relationship
building, right? And so, some of our time deposits might be what clients are expecting; some of it will be what
we'd like to do. So, it's a bit of – at this point, it's a market where our clients are not requesting that, so that puts
us in the spot where we get to design the product mix.
And at this point, as David mentioned, yeah, we think we have the right product mix at this point. But we're
watching it consistently and putting our own forecasts together on, yeah, what we think would happen and what
would make sense.

Okay. That's helpful. And then, any update on the loan floors? I think the press release mentioned that 94% of the
loans are floating and indexed at 30 days. Just remind us how active the floors are currently. And any
commentary you can provide on how many Fed fund hikes we'd have to see to get above those floors. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. Great. Yeah. It's less than two %. So, there's a bit of a difference on the floor levels across the different
loan product types. But in two Fed rate moves we would be through the floors on average, fundamentally. So, it's
been a significant contributor to the business over the last 12 months. But as we continue to adapt new loan
originations and how we're approaching spreads and floors going forward, it would be about two rate moves as
you look at the whole loan portfolio.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. Great. So, yeah, we continue to grow into the mid-60s from a portfolio composition perspective. I mean, as
you're seeing, when we say 15% to 20%, we're talking about the private bank, obviously a larger base, and then
growing at not quite double but a premium, a multiple of the commercial side. So, that will continue to grow.
I think this second quarter is probably a bit – probably a bigger difference between the rates of growth. I think the
third quarter will probably a bit more reflective. But I think what we're talking about, the commercial side growing
12% and the private bank more on 25%. So, that's for the 10% to 12%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, in terms of just loan pricing these days, just wondering if you could give any
update on where spreads are for commercial loans, and the commercial real estate, and also the private banking
loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think from our guidance perspective from last time, we were on our – I think we are probably still in the
same place. Our CRE loans, from a yield perspective, sort of that 3% to 3.75% range. C&I loans sort of the 2.5%
to 3% in a quarter range. And private bank loans probably at 2% to 3% range. So, those are from a yield
perspective, where we are seeing things come in now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Just a quick follow-up on the C&I expectations for the back half of the year. I appreciate your comments in the
prepared remarks and the Q&A. But just if you could give some color on what's driving the optimism in the back
half. I know equipment finance is seasonally strong in 4Q. But any other color in terms of order of magnitude for
growth and what the drivers are there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. I think, we're – I mean, if you look at our, again, rate of growth expectations or our goals for the commercial
side, probably slightly lower than we've had in past years. So, that's a 12% growth rate. It is probably optimistic for
a lot of people. It's probably middle of the road for us. So, pleased, but not satisfied with that, just from a point of
perspective.
But, yeah, the first half of the year, we're continuing to see good production on the commercial real estate side. I
mean, I would say, that we've actually seen a little bit from unanticipated idiosyncratic payoff perspective on
commercial real estate, where some of our clients not looking to sell were offered some pretty significant
opportunities.
So, we've lost that balance in the short term, but those are clients that we work with very significantly,. And we
see them redeploying that capital into new opportunities. So, we'll be there with them to grow that piece back. But
overall, the commercial real estate, we're confident in our ability to continue to grow that positive sense with our
clients.
And then, the fund finance, if we look at it, we're only about $200 million borrowed against about $600 million in
commitments. So, we see a significant opportunity for that to tick up in the second half of the year. So, we
continue to grow that business very nicely and we like who we're working with. But we see more opportunities and
just timing of where they're going to put capital to work in the second half. So, that'll be positive. And then, as we
indicated, second half, usually better for equipment and finance anyway. But as supply chains ease and things of
that nature; deals that we've already won that we'll fund in the third and fourth quarter, that will be positive.
So, those are the fundamental aspects. I mean, nothing really – I think we're – nothing exceptional. Pretty
consistent themes that we've had in over the year, just coming to play in the second half of the year. But overall,
we're very optimistic about how our clients and prospects are performing.
Again, if you look at our – I mean we obviously provided deferral activity, but we're – as of today, we're down to
two loans that are still on the deferral program of less than $20 million. So, again, the way that our clients have
managed through this and are growing actually through the 2021, 2022 timeframe is very strong. So, we're
optimistic about our ability to grow with our existing clients as well as attract new ones.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate the color, Brian. Thank you. And then, just switching gears, for the last question, to expenses. You
guys reiterated the 10% to 12% expectation for this year. And as you continue to plan for the future and continue
to franchise investment, and items like travel and entertainment like begin to normalize, is that a range that you
expect to be able to maintain over a longer term? Or are there near-term plans for the businesses that could push
that range higher going forward?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
This is Jim Getz. Let me comment first. And this is probably one of the only times in this type of call that you'll
hear this. This expense growth has always been by design. And our expenses clearly reflect our continual
investment in our people, our infrastructure, our technology and our clients while moving toward the future. And
we're doing this, as you notice in this quarter's numbers, while our profit margins are expanding.
So, that's what I meant in the end of my presentation when we talked about critical mass. We've reached that
critical mass level, that we're going to be able to continue to do that and invest in the future while we're providing
a profitable franchise to our shareholders. David?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer-TriState Capital Bank & TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, Russell, let me just add some color commentary to that. So, year-over-year, we've grown a revenue at
16%. The balance sheet's grown at 26%. And expenses, as you note, are growing at about 14.5%. This supports
our overall goal of positive operating leverage. Importantly, the overall efficiency ratio for the bank has slightly
improved when comparing the year-to-date results over the prior year, as has the noninterest expense, the
average asset ratio. Efficiency ratio stands at 51% year-to-date and noninterest expense is about 126%.
Our ROE, our return on equity, has steadily and substantially improved in each of the last four quarters. That now
stands at 10.37% on a spot basis as of the most recent quarter, as we put the capital that we've raised in two
different raises last year to work. We believe we can continue to drive ROE improvements in the quarters ahead.
What this tells us is that the investments we're making that Jim pointed out are driving better execution and
making our business more efficient and effective. It tells us that we're making good investments.
Let me give you some color on the primary drivers of expense growth. One is people. Compensation cost is up
20% year-over-year and technology and data services is up 44% year-over-year. The growth rate on these two
expenses should moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. Hiring was minimized last year, second
quarter, in light of the early stages of the pandemic; whereas this year, we have front-loaded that hiring to the
beginning of the year, coupled with some strong financial results driving incentive accrual increases. But that
hiring piece should moderate somewhat in the second half.
In the area of technology and data, we delayed our innovation and development spend through the second
quarter of 2020, again in light of the pandemic, but began implementing more robust development in the second
half of last year, and that continues into 2021. For technology and data on a full-year basis, I would say, the year-
over-year comparison should be somewhere in the low to mid-20% range, down from 44% of what you're seeing
right now.
Other expenses is also something that grew very modestly in the quarter. It was driven by growth on our
unfunded loan commitments. That expense is categorized differently than the funded on-balance-sheet loans
through the reserves in the income statement. So, just simply a function of growth. We still intend to drive positive
operating leverage, growing revenue faster than expenses. And we are driving to keep expense growth to 12%
year-over-year. We've got work to do to get there, but we will not sacrifice our long-term objectives. And we'll
continue to focus on serving our clients well.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Yes, I'll just add. I think both Jim and David summed it up well. We're excited about where we're going. We've
continued to – we took about a four-week hiatus last year, just to see where things would sort of level out in the
second quarter. But absent that four weeks, we've continued to invest in the business, understanding where the
opportunities are. And again, as we sit here around the table, we're as optimistic as we ever have been in all the
lines of the business. I think Jim summed it up earlier, we couldn't be more happy with what we're showing here.
And this makes sense to keep investing in this and staying ahead of it. And rewarding – not only paying off
growth, rewarding investors and rewarding our clients for continuing to grow with us.

James F. Getz A

Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have a follow-up from Matt Olney from Stephens. Please go ahead
with your follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah, thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess, as I speak with investors, it seems like the market's very concerned
about TriState's impact to higher short-term rates. And we talked earlier about the floors that could be a potential
headwind for at least the first few rate hikes.
But I guess, taking a step back, I'm curious what you'd expect from the bank's net interest margin on the first few
rate hikes. I guess, if I look at the 10-Q disclosures around the shock analysis, my assumption is, is that the bank
does expect an initial downward move in the margin with the first few rate hikes. But I would love to hear any
commentary you can add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer-TriState Capital Bank & TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, Matt, we just followed the dot plot, right? And so, the dot plot would suggest there's two raises sometime in
2023. But if I just look at our forecast for the next two years, which obviously is very preliminary, we see a modest
expansion throughout that period. So, we're not tied to the tenure; we're tied to short rates as you point out. But
between deposit cost moderation, things that we're studying in terms of sort of fixing rates for a longer period of
time and just the ability to deploy the liquidity quickly into income-producing assets, we see a modest expansion
through the next two years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
I think from a positive deposit perspective, yeah, the one thing that's not modeled in there is – again, from a client
perspective, our goal is to work with every product that they would need. And our goal is to own their entire
relationship. So, we have a blend of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits with them.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
But if you look at the service side of the business, and you look at like our treasury management business – I
think we've talked about before – in a normalized rate environment, our goal is to run that business on the rate
side at a LIBOR equivalent of minus 100 basis points. So, LIBOR, whatever index you want to pick, less 100
basis points.
So, if you think about here, where obviously there is no LIBOR minus 100. So, yeah, we think that there's a lot of
protection built into the existing business, which is a natural hedge, which is obviously the way we've built it. And
then, obviously, as we talked before with opportunities for us to build in term deposits and some other things we
get closer. But that breakeven point is pretty important, as you'd know. And so absent a real client demand, we're
probably a little early in that process. But again, a lot of natural hedges built into the business that maybe weren't
as robust in the 2018 timeframe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And within the deposit balance, can you remind us, what percent of those are indexed? And how would you
expect that to change, if at all, over the next few years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. So, if you look at – overall, I mean, we talked about it in the release that we talked about 60% of – what it
would be, 60% of non-timed interest-bearing deposits I would link to a EFF or some equivalent index. So, if we
look at, overall, it comes out about 21% of total deposits that would be indexed in that way. So, yeah, I am
moderating that pretty significantly. At one point, we're probably more in that 45% range. So, we think, again, a
good diversification across the deposit portfolio.
I mean, we still like that from a pricing perspective and it's building – it's a source of a lot of sophisticated
relationships with us who we have – private bank relationships with other lending aspects. So, we're happy with
that component of the portfolio. But it's a good measure of where we continue to diversify the deposit base and
the pricing base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's great, Brian. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, the last question is around capital. And I'm looking
at the leverage ratio at the bank. I think, we're now, I'll call it, 7.34%. And I think we saw the capital raise last year
when we got down to that 7% level. So, we'd love to hear any updated thoughts you have on addressing the
capital needs of the bank, especially given the strong outlook for loan growth repair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer-TriState Capital Bank & TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, Matt. As you point out, we've grown the balance sheet at the higher end of our expectations this year.
Strong growth, and we expect that to continue. We've worked hard to put the capital raise last year to use in high-
quality new loans and increase balance sheet liquidity in the investment portfolio. We're striving to get to that
close to – or get that to 15%, and we're close now.
I talked a little earlier about our ROE, our return on equity. We're pleased that it's at 10.37%. We believe we have
more room to improve that in the coming quarters. And that's up from 6.5% this time last year. So, great
improvement there.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
The capital we've raised is now deployed and starting to generate meaningful returns. We continue to be very
thoughtful and flexible around capital strategies. We don't necessarily need to raise capital before year-end. And
we'd be fine starting 2022 with the current levels in terms of the balance sheet composition, loan growth and
where capital sits. Having said that, we'll continue to look at opportunities to raise capital in what we would
describe as a very economical and most efficient way with a continued focus on the shareholder.
Given the market conditions, sub-debt could be a very attractive form of that additional capital, given where rates
are. And, as you know, you raise that to the holding company, you push it down to the bank, and it counts as Tier
1. So, no immediate plans to access the capital markets, but it's something we're looking at as the coming
quarters play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
President & Chief Executive Officer-TriState Capital Bank & Director-TriState Capital Holdings, Inc., TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. And I think I would add that, Tim used the statement, what our primary job is, our mission is. And so, we
saw it as, obviously, having raised $200 million in a pretty rapid time period in 2020. Again, taking the moments in
time to realize that we were going to have some pretty significant growth opportunities, which we would consider
better than the market or better than the industry.
And we knew that we needed to take that time to invest, and so we could be there for those opportunities. So,
we're certainly bringing those to bear. And we viewed it as part of our job on a risk-adjusted basis, responsible
growth basis, to deploy that capital as quickly as possible to basically cover the lag on capital raises. So, we're
very happy with where we've done it. If you look at the asset growth relative to – for example, loan to deposit ratio
is 91%, is clearly reflective of our ability to raise deposits and deploy that into other assets. That asset mix could
give us some flexibility as well as how we look at funding the loans at any particular time.
And we've talked about it before, from an investment perspective, staying very high quality in relatively short
duration. So, again, our goal is to be as agile as possible between funding, and capital, and asset and balance
sheet management. So, we have some flexibility in there, as David pointed out, timing, but certainly being
opportunistic. We have some historic opportunities ahead on the growth side, probably the capital if we wanted to
pursue that in the sub-debt space, and otherwise just to manage our balance sheet.
