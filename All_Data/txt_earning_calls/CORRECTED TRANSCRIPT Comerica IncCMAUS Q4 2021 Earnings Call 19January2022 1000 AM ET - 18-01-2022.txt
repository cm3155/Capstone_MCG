Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 2021 was another extraordinary year, which provided
unique challenges and opportunities to meet the needs of our customers, colleagues, and communities. I'm
incredibly proud of the commitment of our team. We continue to persevere through the challenges of the
pandemic while providing a high level of service and achieving many accomplishments along the way.
PPP loans were again a lifeline for many of our customers, and we were there to navigate them through the
process. We funded over $1 billion in the second round of PPP loans, supporting more than 6,000 customers. As
of year-end, 91% of these loans have been repaid, mostly through the forgiveness process. Also, to further
demonstrate our commitment to our communities, we made a pledge to lend $5 billion to small businesses over a
three-year period.
Our annual employee engagement survey was conducted and among our top strength, Comerica's values stood
out with 84% of respondents providing favorable marks. In addition, 94% of our colleagues agreed our response
to the COVID-19 pandemic was excellent. We listened to what matters to our colleagues and rolled out additional
benefits as well as a hybrid work arrangement for many of our team members who can split their time between
the office and home. This provides flexibility for our colleagues while maintaining our relationship-based strategy.
We have the tools and the strong culture to attract and retain the best talent even in the tight labor market, which
has been a strength for us throughout our history.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Recently, we established an Office of Corporate Responsibility to bring key environmental, social, and
governance elements together under one umbrella. The office reports directly to me, and it underscores our
dedication to protecting and preserving the environment, diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as serving and
strengthening our communities. Also, our ESG Council defined the most significant ESG issues for our company,
specifically those that are most impactful for our customers and colleagues and in which we feel we can make a
meaningful difference. In addition, we have started our preliminary analysis to develop a framework to measure
climate risk in our commercial lending portfolio.
Once again, our commitment to corporate responsibility has been recognized. We were recently included in
Newsweek's 2021 listing of America's Most Responsible Companies and Forbes 2021 Best Employer for Women.
We provide high customer satisfaction by levering our expertise and experience in the areas we serve. In
addition, more than ever, technology plays a major role in delivering the services our customers and colleagues
require. Currently, we are in the process of modernizing our core platforms to drive greater operational excellence
and empower our colleagues to serve our customers better.
For example, we are refreshing our banking center teller platform and have kicked off the project to upgrade our
commercial loan servicing systems. Also, we are leveraging digitization tools to reimagine and reengineer critical
customer journeys that make it easier for our customers to do business with us. Comerica has a rich history of
helping our customers, communities, and colleagues thrive. This focus is essential and foundational to effectively
executing our relationship banking strategy.
Turning to our 2021 financial results. Slide 4 provides a few highlights. We produced record earnings per share of
$8.35. Average deposits grew 19% and supported solid loan performance in a number of businesses while
providing significant excess liquidity to fund future growth. As a result, total average assets increased to $90
billion, an all-time high. Credit quality was excellent and we released reserves. Our book value per share
increased to over $57. With strong market appreciation and our attractive dividend, we generated a total
shareholder return of 62%, one of the highest among our peers.
Slide 5 provides further details. Relative to 2020, we had average loan growth in several of our specialty areas,
specifically Equity Fund Services, Environmental Services, Entertainment and Commercial Real Estate. Also,
excluding PPP, we had positive trends in Middle Market throughout the year, including a strong finish. The growth
was more than offset by a large decline in National Dealer Services due to supply constraints as well as Energy
as the sector recovered and reduced leverage.
Revenue increased to $3 billion. While net interest income was challenged by the ultra-low rate environment,
noninterest income growth was broad base, increasing 12% to a new record. Noninterest expenses reflected a
higher compensation in conjunction with favorable performance and operating costs tied to greater revenue
generation.
Credit metrics were excellent, as evidenced by net recoveries for the year, a reflection of our careful customer
selection, diverse portfolio, and a conservative underwriting culture. As a result of strong capital generation, we
returned $1.1 billion to common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of, what, 9.5 million or 7% of
total shares.
In summary, a strong performance, with an ROE of over 15% and an ROA of 1.3%.

Our fourth quarter results are outlined on slide 6. We generated earnings of $1.66 per share. Excluding PPP,
average loans grew over $600 million, led by Middle Market and Corporate Banking. PPP balances declined
nearly $1 billion as the forgiveness process progressed. Also, Mortgage Banker declined about $300 million due
to seasonal and cyclical factors. Average deposits increased over $5 billion. Excluding PPP, revenue increased
as a result of loan growth and robust fee income. Credit quality was exceptional and we released reserves.
Expenses reflected investments in our people and technology to support our revenue-generating activities. Also,
we repurchased $50 million in common shares and maintained an attractive dividend yield.
We expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong this year. Our Chief Economist forecasts world GDP to
increase over 4% in 2022. And we believe each of our primary markets, California, Texas and Michigan, should
perform at or above that level. Our customers and colleagues have successfully navigated the challenges of the
past two years and today stand stronger and more confident about the future.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will review the quarter in more detail.

James J. Herzog
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 7. As Curt just mentioned, excluding the decline in
PPP loans, we had solid loan growth in several businesses. The largest driver once again was general Middle
Market, which was up over $500 million on average relative to the third quarter. In addition, large corporate
increased over $400 million or 10%, and National Dealer was up nearly $200 million. Partly offsetting this growth
were declines in Mortgage Banker and Commercial Real Estate.
Historically, we have seen strong seasonal loan growth in December and this year was no exception. Average
loans increased nearly $900 million in December relative to November. This helped drive period-end loans up
$1.1 billion relative to the end of the third quarter despite a $561 million decrease in PPP loans. This essentially
reflected the same drivers that we saw on the average balances. I'll take a moment now to provide detail on the
major pieces.
We continue to see positive trends in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking. Higher commodity prices
and rebuilding of inventory levels are in part resulting in an increasing working capital needs. M&A and dividend
or equity distributions are also drivers. However, there are some headwinds mainly related to supply chain
disruptions and, in some cases, excess liquidity, which can temper borrowing. But overall, our customers remain
optimistic. And that is reflected in our pipeline and growing loan commitment levels.
The increase in National Dealer services loans included a small increase in floor plan loans, which remained
extraordinarily low relative to the typical historical run rate of about $4 billion. We expect inventory levels will
slowly rebuild over the next one to two years as supply issues are resolved and pent-up demand is satisfied.
Mortgage Banker declined as a result of cyclical as well as seasonal factors. Loans have slowly decreased from
the wind-down of the refi boom after reaching record levels at the end of 2020. However, purchase activity has
remained strong and, therefore, we should fare better than others in this space, given that 70% of our mix is
purchase related while the industry average is 47%.
Commercial Real Estate was impacted by significant pay-downs. However, loan production remained strong, and
our pipeline and line commitments increased in the fourth quarter. Loan commitments for the portfolio as a whole
increased $400 million led by Corporate Banking and Middle Market, partly offset by a decline in Mortgage
Banker. The line utilization rate held steady at 47%.

Loan yields decreased 13 basis points, including 8 basis points from the impact of PPP loans, 4 basis points from
swap maturities and lower average rates on loans with floors, as well as other portfolio dynamics, such as the mix
shift in the portfolio.
As shown on slide 8, average deposits again set a record, increasing $5.4 billion with nearly three-quarters of the
growth derived from noninterest-bearing accounts. This growth was due to fourth quarter seasonality, along with
continuing trends we have seen related to our customers' solid profitability, capital markets activity, and various
fiscal and monetary actions. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits hit an all-time low of 5 basis points and
our total funding cost held steady at only 6 basis points.
Slide 9 provides details on our securities portfolio. We continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity by
increasing the size of the securities portfolio. This mitigated the risk to the rate headwind, resulting in a slight
increase in securities income quarter-over-quarter. MBS purchases in the fourth quarter had average durations of
about six years and yields of about 190 basis points. With securities rolling off with rates over 200 basis points,
total portfolio yield declined to 1.71%.
Our goal is to prudently reduce our asset sensitivity at a measured pace. In part, this can be achieved through
gradually deploying excess liquidity by opportunistically growing the securities book. This has had the added
benefit of helping to offset any pressure on revenue from lower reinvestment yields and maturing swaps.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest income decreased $14 million. Excluding an $18 million drop in PPP income, net
interest income increased $4 million. The net interest margin declined 19 basis points, mainly due to a large
increase in excess liquidity, which had an 11 basis point impact, as well as the decrease in PPP income, which
had a 6 basis point impact.
As far as the details, putting aside the decline in PPP income, interest income on loans was stable. Growth in
non-PPP loans offset the impact from lower rates on loan floors and a swap maturity, as well as other dynamics,
such as a mix shift in the portfolio.
As I mentioned, the increase in the size of the securities portfolio essentially offset the impact of lower yields. A
$4.7 billion increase in average balances at the Fed added $2 million and had an 11 basis point negative impact
on the margin. Fed deposits were extraordinarily high at nearly $25 billion and weighed heavily on the margin with
the gross impact of 73 basis points.
As far as credit, which is outlined on slide 11, our metrics remained excellent, including net recoveries of $4
million as well as another quarter of declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans. Our provision was a credit of $25
million. Positive portfolio migration, growing economic confidence, and sustained favorable economic forecasts,
although layered with some degree of uncertainty, resulted in a reduction in our allowance for credit losses to
1.26% of loans. However, coverage of nonperforming assets increased to 2.3 times.
Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator, and we believe
we will continue to outperform. We remain vigilant given potential stress on our customers from the Omicron virus,
supply chain disruptions, labor constraints, and inflation.
Noninterest income increased $9 million, as outlined on slide 12. Derivative income grew $7 million and was
broad-based with increased activity and interest rate hedges, foreign exchange trading, and energy derivatives.
Deferred comp, which is offset in expenses, increased $5 million from almost $0 in the third quarter. Fiduciary

income increased $2 million, returning to the second quarter's record level with growth in our trust business and
continued strong equity market performance.
Following strong third quarter syndication fees, which were at an all-time high, commercial lending fees declined
$3 million. As expected, government card activity declined as state benefit programs waned. However, this was
mostly offset by increases in merchant and commercial card activity. Also, BOLI income decreased primarily due
to the receipt of the annual dividend in the third quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with another very strong quarter, which capped off a record year for fee income. As
shown on slide 13, expenses were up $21 million in the quarter. In short, this included the increase in deferred
comp, which is offset in noninterest income, and higher tech labor as well as seasonal staff insurance and
occupancy.
As far as the specifics, salaries and benefits increased $10 million. As expected, technology-related labor costs
increased as they typically do at year-end, as we completed a number of projects. I just mentioned the impact
from deferred comp and staff insurance. Also, we incurred $3 million in additional expenses that related to mid-
cycle [indiscernible] (17:29) increases, retention bonuses and severance costs, as we work to ensure we have the
best talent for our future needs in a very tight and competitive labor market. This was partly offset by lower
performance-based incentives following elevated third quarter levels.
In addition, occupancy was seasonally higher. Also, we had increases in legal expenses of $4 million, primarily
related to strong year-end loan closing activity as well as operational losses, asset disposition losses and T&E,
which are all captured in other expenses. We continue to maintain our expense discipline as we position for future
growth by investing in technology and our people, which are key to our relationship banking strategy.
Slide 14 provides details on capital management. Loan growth, combined with share repurchases, resulted in a
decrease in our CET1 ratio to an estimated 10.15%. We continue to closely monitor loan trends and capital
generation as we focus on our 10% CET1 target. In addition, we have maintained a competitive dividend yield. As
always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive
return to our shareholders.
Before we turn to the outlook, slide 15 provides an overview of our interest rate sensitivity models, which forecast
the benefit of rising rates to net interest income. The standard model assumes a non-parallel rise in rates with a
dynamic balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we estimated a $205 million or 12% increase in annual
net interest income over 12 months as rates gradually rise 100 basis points, and the benefit will be slightly greater
in year two.
Our asset sensitivity moved higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the extraordinary deposit growth. Our
goal is to gradually reduce our asset sensitivity over time as market conditions allow. And as rates rise, we would
likely pick up the pace. However, as you see in the various alternative scenarios we have provided, in all cases,
our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains very well-positioned to rising rates.
Our outlook for 2022 is on slide 16 and assumes no change in interest rates and a strong economy with gradual
improvement of supply chain and labor challenges. We expect average loan growth on a year-over-year basis in
the mid-single-digit range, excluding the decline in PPP loans. Increases in nearly every business, ex-PPP, are
expected to be partly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker from continued normalization of refi volumes and
lower National Dealer due to a slow rebound as a result of the supply chain issues. This belief is supported by our
robust pipeline, positive momentum in several businesses, and our outlook for continued economic growth.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
As far as the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, we expect the average loans to be stable with growth in
Middle Market, large corporate and Commercial Real Estate, offset by lower Mortgage Banker and Dealer. We
believe average deposits will remain elevated for the near future. Due to seasonality, we do expect deposits to
decline modestly in the first quarter. And as far as net interest income, the major driver is expected to be loan
dynamics.
PPP-related income was $111 million in 2021 and will not be repeated. Putting that aside, the benefit from loan
growth is expected to be partly offset by lower loan yields, driven by lower rate floors on loans, competitive
pressures, and a mix shift in the portfolio. The first quarter will be impacted by lower PPP income and two fewer
days.
For simplicity, this outlook does not assume any rate changes. However, as I discussed on the previous slide, we
are highly sensitive to rate movements. Therefore, rates are a key driver for our net interest income in 2022.
Furthermore, as rates rise, a larger than planned increase in our securities portfolio or adding swaps presents
additional opportunity.
Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Net charge-offs are expected to begin to trend to the lower end of our
normal range of 20 to 40 basis points. Assuming the economy continues on the current path and the impacts of
supply chain issues, labor constraints as well as inflation remain muted, we expect the allowance ratio to continue
declining modestly.
As far as noninterest income, 2021 was the highest on record and included very strong performance in nearly
every category. Some levels are unlikely to repeat in 2022 such as warrant-related activity, derivative income,
including favorable CVA, stimulus-related card fees, and deferred compensation. These line items may also be a
headwind in the first quarter. However, we expect continued solid performance in several customer-driven fee
categories, such as fiduciary, deposit service charges, and brokerage.
We expect expenses to increase in the low-single digits. This includes inflationary pressures, which could impact
a number of line items, such as salaries, T&E, and insurance. Also, we are focused on product and market
development as well as driving efficiency, which means continued investment in technology. We expect these
headwinds to be partly offset by resetting performance compensation to normal levels. Of note, our pension
expense will improve by $7 million for the year.
First quarter expenses are expected to be lower with the annual stock compensation more than offset by the
decline in performance comp, seasonal declines in items such as advertising and staff insurance and other items
that are expected to decline from elevated levels in the fourth quarter such as deferred comp, legal, and
severance costs.
We expect the tax rate to be 22% to 23% excluding discrete items. Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we
are focused on our CET1 target of 10% as we monitor loan growth trends.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Also, we produced record fee income and deposit growth as well as excellent credit quality. Revenue was up and
our efficiency ratio held steady, resulting in strong returns.
I'm honored to work along with such a talented, committed, and hardworking team. With our expertise and
experience, we are building long-term relationships. We are focused on delivering a more diversified and
balanced revenue stream with an emphasis on fee generation, which was evident this past year. Also, our unique
geographic footprint provides significant growth opportunities, including the expansion of our southeast presence.
We will continue to carefully manage expenses as we invest in our products and services and make progress on
our ongoing digital journey. Finally, our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well.
These key strengths provide the foundation for creating long-term shareholder value. We are well-positioned as
we move forward in 2022.
Thank you for your time. And now we'd be happy to take some questions.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I'm hoping we can start on the loan growth outlook. I understand
that the fourth quarter is seasonal. But could you speak to the pipelines at the end of the year? And I noticed the
end-of-period loan growth was notably stronger than average. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Chris, this is Peter. Yeah. The fourth quarter is normally a good quarter for us, although I think this quarter was
exceptionally good from years that we've had in the past. And it does feel really good about jumping off for 2022,
our period-end was really strong. The pipeline continues to be above pre-pandemic levels. I will say it came down
a little bit just with closures through the second half of the year, but still really good compared to history. And so,
as we said in our outlook, we feel really good about where we stand at this point in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And maybe a follow-up, understanding the deposits are continuing to surprise to the upside. You mentioned a
couple times in your prepared remarks the likelihood to grow the investment book to take down rate sensitivity. I'm
interested kind of in the pace of securities purchases if you kind of layer in the Fed, the futures curve. Thanks.

Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
There are a number of different ways this could go. We've seen quite a bit of rate movement just in the last couple
days. So, take your pick as to where rates may go. In the outlook, we do assume just modest increases in our
securities portfolio. As you may have observed, we've been increasing them by about $0.5 billion on average per
quarter. We're actually assuming something just slightly less than that in this baseline outlook that we have. But,
again, that's got the potential to really take a step up, whether we choose to do it with securities, with cash
products, or maybe choose to do it with swaps off balance sheet. Those are somewhat interchangeable to an
extent. That will be driven by what we see in terms of the rate outlook. And certainly, we're willing to step that up
and will want to step it up as rates go increasingly higher. So, it really comes down to monitoring the environment
and responding to it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And is there a max of which the size of the investment portfolio you'd like to manage in this environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's going to be highly dependent and we are observing on what goes on with liquidity and the economy both
short term and long term. There's a little bit of flux right now in terms of what the Fed might do with its balance
sheet longer term. And so, we're going to observe that and make our call off of that. We think in the short term,
there is some room to grow it. How much room there is to grow it remains to be seen, again, based on just where
we see overall liquidity and deposits in the system going. But it's not really a concern of ours because if we do hit
some type of limit and we will hit that limit at some point, we don't want to grow the securities book inappropriately
or indefinitely. But we always have the option to put on a tremendous amount of swaps in terms of the capacity
we have for that. So, again, it will be interchangeable between those two instruments, and we'll just monitor
overall liquidity and market conditions.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Morning. On the loan growth, again to the end-of-period, how much of that growth that you saw end-of-period
commercial balances represent any type of pull-forward on LIBOR-based loans, given the change to SOFR in the
beginning of this year? Did you see any of that out of your commercial borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Hey John. It's Peter. I think the short answer to your question is no. I don't think the shift from LIBOR to SOFR is
necessarily causing any increase in loan demand or changes there. I think the borrowing community is continuing
to make their decisions for their businesses and sort of navigating that shift in use of LIBOR to SOFR separately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, separately, can you – regarding rate sensitivity, I get a fair amount of
questions from investors around your rationale for driving your asset sensitivity lower or, another way, maybe
pulling forward some of that asset sensitivity, particularly now that we have relatively high certainty regarding the
timing and magnitude of expected Fed hikes. So, if you could just walk through that again in terms of the rationale
of pulling forward or driving lower your asset sensitivity given that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, John. It's Jim. Happy to do that. And I will say, in talking to both investors and analysts, I see a variety of
opinions, and it's interesting. I hear some saying you should hold off and I see some saying, why aren't you taking
advantage of this and moving faster. And to me, those opinions are equally divided.
Our answer is that we want to be measured and methodical in terms of how we do this. To the extent you hold off
for higher rates and look to hit that homerun someday, there's obviously opportunity costs or carrying costs that
you're imposing upon shareholders over that short to medium term. So, that's something we're very cognitive of.
We also know, from the last decade-plus, there's no guarantee that rates will go perpetually up, and they can turn
at any time with the black swan events that we've seen and so on over the last several years.
And so, we are going to move very methodically, but we're not going to move all at once either because we are
cognitive of the fact that rates could go higher and higher. So, we think steady and consistent progress makes
sense, and we've been moving on this. But again, we're moving at a pretty measured pace, to your point. We are
leaving some there in the kind of out-quarters to make sure we take advantage of what could be a persistent rise
in rates, but we're not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for that homerun someday either. So, we feel really
good about being in the middle of the road and just making consistent, measured progress.

Got it. Thanks, Jim. And if I could ask just one more? Sorry, if I missed this earlier. But can you just give us your
thoughts on how do you think your betas will project as we get these hikes through the year? Thanks.

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
We have those sensitivities on the interest rate sensitivity slide. And I think it's fair to say that we have a pretty
good chance of staying at or below that 10% beta alternative that you see there. That would be consistent with
what we saw during the last rate cycle and rate started going up. And actually, there's more liquidity in the system

right now. So, I would actually be surprised if we don't replicate that performance. So, I think betas will be very
well-behaved for the first few hikes and we'll monitor it from there.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I guess, just sticking with loan growth. Two questions there. One, I was wondering if you can
comment around what you're seeing across the different markets, California versus Texas versus Midwest. And
also, how much of the growth outlook depends on supply chains easing at least to some extent, or do you feel like
there is growth ex any of that happening that should emerge this year, provided we don't have any big disruptions
on – any additional disruption from COVID?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Ebrahim, it's Peter. I'll take the second one first. I don't think that we're necessarily expecting resolution one way
or another around supply chain on our outlook. So, we feel good about the outlook regardless, although I think
you're seeing as much as we are that there is some positive indicators of what's going on in supply chain,
particularly in the second half of the year. But I don't know that it's part of what we're communicating to you
outlook.
As far as the markets go, it feels really good in all three markets. Michigan and Texas had really great year sort of
all year. California came on really, really strong in the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter.
So, I think all three markets are positioned very well going into 2022. And the customer sentiment is positive I
think in each of those, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess, just one follow-up, maybe more strategic. As you look through your peer set, right, a lot of
them have gone through large M&A over the recent years and have doubled or tripled their asset sizes. When you
think about just relative positioning, just talk to us in terms of competitive disadvantages of scale that you have,
your appetite to engage in M&A that could increase size and market penetration? Just how are you thinking about
all of that?

Hi Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Nothing has really changed for us there. Our model has forever been built really on relationship banking and
organic growth. We are in some very attractive markets and very fast growing markets, especially Texas and
California. And we've had opportunities to expand our franchise. For example, our entry into North Carolina and
the Southeast. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that more on an organic basis. And we think our
size – where we're operating today makes us nimble, so to speak. We've got the right sort of scale. We've got the
right talent in place in great markets. We've invested in technology, I think, to meet our customer needs and really
feel like we are not – we'll be patient around any M&A activity if it makes sense for us to do so. But we really feel
like we've got great opportunities just to continue to grow organically. We will look for and we have looked for in
the past possibly some small fee income tuck-in opportunities along the way if it really helps us expand or
enhance capabilities, but we'll do that in a very strategic manner.

Anthony Elian Q

Hi. Morning. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. My first question on loan growth, so general Middle Market up
about $525 million this quarter. Did you see these Middle Market borrowers draw down on their deposit balances
before using their credit lines, or are they drawing on their credit lines while still holding elevated cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Anthony, it's Peter. The second or the latter part of your statement there, I think we're seeing good growth in
Middle Market borrowings, and we're still seeing pretty good deposit growth in Middle Market in general. And I've
said in the past, I think your average Middle Market company continues to be optimistic, but making sure they've
got access to capital, both on their borrowing side and maintaining good liquidity. So, this has been something
we've seen now several quarters, and I know all of us are kind of wondering is there going to be a shift in that
strategy. And so far, we have not seen that. So, both continue to be occurring.

Okay. And then my follow-up. On slide 3, you outlined some of the technology investments you made last year,
including in data centers and modernization. Are these similar areas that you expect to invest in this year, or
anything new you're targeting for investments? Thank you.

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Anthony. It's Jim. We'll certainly see some of those trends continue. But in addition, we do see ourselves
maybe shifting the emphasis a little bit more towards customer product. We're there already. You see Treasury,
for instance, listed there. But I do think we'll see more and more – higher proportion of our investment in
technology go to customer product sets, especially those that we want to be the best in as the leading bank for
business. But as I mentioned in my script, too, we're also focused on technology in the back room operations,
making sure the application systems are up to speed and making sure that our employees are efficient. So you'll
see some of these same trends continue. But again, I would probably add that you'll see some additional shift into
kind of leading-edge digital customer products.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Jim, in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that first quarter average loan
balances are expected to be flat to the fourth quarter. Does that represent a decent amount of just kind of pull-
forward temporary balances, whether in Middle Market or in large corporate at year-end that would kind of get
paid off early in the new year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Gary, I would say it's actually more typical of just what I'll call general seasonality of our customers. Now, those
things you mentioned could be a piece of it, but they are the types of things we see every year. I think if you went
back 10 years, you generally see the first quarter not as strong as the fourth quarter. So, it's got an element of a
lot of things really just inherent of our customers' overall business models and their capital needs and funding
needs in the first quarter. So, really a number of things, but just overall seasonality, I would say.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q

Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the comments around technology. We've seen a decent flow of
announcements in terms of banks adopting different kind of payment networks around kind of digital and
blockchain technology. Are you seeing any kind of pull from your customers on that? And really, is that any part of
the other kind of maybe newer products that you were referencing going to 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Gary, I think the short answer is no, not really on the blockchain technology part of it. Our focus when we
talk about digital is really around customer experience and making it as easy as possible for our customers to do
business. I suspect things will be – over time, how things unfold with blockchain and so forth will be interesting to
see. We're watching that, but it's not what we're talking about on the investments that Jim mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, I might add there, and Gary, that we are early adopters of payments technology. So, we were one of the
early adopters of the Zelle platform and have had good success with that with our clients. And we are adopters or
have real-time payments capabilities in place, both for sending and receiving. And there's not a lot of demand for
that yet in the industry, but we're positioned to leverage that to make sure our customers are taken care of.

Yeah. The way I think about technology, certainly, we need to be digitally-enabled and we need to have the right
products and services that our customers are wanting and demanding, both commercial and consumer
customers. But when you think about our model with a heavy focus on Commercial Banking, that is still very much
an advisory-based business, it's a relationship-based business where we're bringing a lot of credit expertise and
overall banking expertise to client conversations and digital help enable some of the things that we do. But it's
challenging to acquire a large company, let's say, that has $500 million in top line revenue using some sort of
digital application.
We need to support the relationship, treasury management and other services with digital. But really, our model is
still driven pretty heavily on the human capital side and the talent and skill and expertise of the bankers that we
have in place. And it's part of what allows us to grow as an institution. For example, our expansion into North
Carolina doesn't have to be based as much on brick-and-mortar as it does on having the right people in the right
places. And many of our national industries, or industry verticals, we operate nationally today in many different
markets, New York, Boston, Chicago, DC, Seattle, Washington, et cetera.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, Jim, I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding higher salaries
and comp expenses. Can you parse out for us how much of the increase is simply related to performance versus
how much of the increases are inflationary? And do you think that low-single-digit growth in the expense outlook
is a sustainable level even as rates rise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Bill. Yeah, it's really been a strange couple years, as I mentioned in the last earnings calls.
It's been a while since we've had a so-called normal expense here, and really just really for all the major line
items. We are forecasting low-single-digit expense growth for 2022. I do think that if the inflationary trends
continue, that would actually be challenging to maintain. We probably see something a tad higher, but we'll see
where wage inflation goes and competition for employees. One of the things that allows us to keep to the low-
single-digits next year, not just for expenses but for salaries and benefits, too, is the fact that we are resetting
performance comp. So, we would probably be a tad higher than low-single-digits, if not [ph] for setting (44:28) the
performance comp and where things go beyond 2022, it is going to depend in large part where wage inflation and
competition for talent goes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. Thank you. Lastly, if I could squeeze in one last one. Following up on your deposit beta commentary, there
seems to be a pretty broad consensus that deposit betas are likely to remain just as low as we saw in the last rate
hiking cycle. But one of the variables that seems to be a bit more pronounced this time around is the risk of Fed
balance sheet runoff happening a little bit sooner. Can you frame how you guys are thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I see that more as an opportunity than a risk because even though the Fed may unwind its balance sheet a little
quicker than they did the last time, keep in mind, it's starting from a much higher spot. So, even if they do that, I
do believe that deposits will likely stay a little higher than they were pre-pandemic level. And I don't know that
they're going to unwind the entire balance sheet. But if they do, it's going to take probably two to three years.

They did go a little shorter this time in terms of how they built it up. But I see a worst-case scenario as they
unwind it back to where their balance sheet was before the pandemic started. So, worst case, you might get back
to liquidity in the system from where we started, but they're probably not going to go quite that far.
In addition, we do see fiscal spending likely staying at some elevated level. BBB did fail, but some form of it's
probably going to pass. And from what we've seen in the past, it's really a combination of monetary policy, the
Fed balance sheet, and the multiplier effect of money, meaning, activity in the economy, which is highly linked to
fiscal spending. And that's probably going to continue. So, overall, I do expect deposits to stay, at least, if not,
higher than what they were pre-pandemic levels. So I don't see it as a risk and I actually see it as an opportunity
that they don't actually unwind quite as far as some people might think.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe I'll start with a question for Jim and maybe Melinda. How do you want us to
think about the provision to kind of set the bar for that? It seems like credit is very, very clean. But just curious if
we can get us any help on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Melinda. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had sort of unprecedented credit performance
this last year. And as Jim mentioned in his comments, I think we do expect that we'll continue to see the reserve
level come down modestly over the next couple of quarters. And at some point, obviously, given the fact that we
are projecting some nice loan growth, we would expect that we'll start to see that trend reverse a little bit, and
we'll start to see a little bit of reserve build. But it's really impossible to predict what the seasonal coverage ratio is
going to be and what the reserve level is going to be because the accounting exercise that we go through each
quarter is very specific to what the portfolio looks like, what the credit metrics are at that time, and what the
economic forecast is. So, our general thought is we'll continue to see that coverage ratio decline a little bit and
then it'll start to level off and we'll be adding, at some point, for loan growth which will be a positive.

Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
The credit quality of the portfolio continues to be very strong. All of the indicators, at least at this point, are that
what we would expect credit to remain very, very strong. This quarter, we did, however, use some of the
qualitative process in that reserve calculation to account for any uncertainty just because of the current Omicron,
inflationary pressure, wage pressure, et cetera. But again, no signs right now on any of the segments of the
portfolio that would give us any level of material concern. And again, we still have very high reserve levels to
handle whatever comes at us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you for that. Jim, on slide 15, on the rate sensitivity slide, just so we understand it, the standard model
you're assuming four hikes throughout the year just kind of ratable hikes in terms of that modeling. Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. You can look at it that way. It's 100 bps on average, so you could think of it as four 25 bp hikes
evenly spaced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, if we think that's the case and we think deposit betas will be lower, would you pull us back at all from –
if I think it's a 10% deposit beta, is there anything in there you'd pull us back on, if I just said, well, gosh, maybe
the current guidance has a little bit lower net interest income. But if I think we get four rate hikes, it's another $230
million in NII. Anything in that guidance that makes you nervous and you'd say, don't do that, Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I'll give you one put and one take. And they both have the potential to be very significant. The takeaway is
keep in mind the fourth quarter interest rate sensitivity was really enhanced by the deposits towards the end of the
year. So, to the extent those take a step back, as we think they probably will, you could end up with a sensitivity
closer to what we saw in the third quarter. So, we'll just see where those seasonal deposits go. So, that would be
the takeaway. The add would be, to the extent – to the earlier question from John, to the extent we pull some of
this forward and put swaps on the books, grow the securities portfolio a little larger than we think, at least within
the first year or two, you have the potential to pull some of that forward and actually add more net interest income.
So, those are a couple, one put, one take, and you can layer that on as you wish to the standard model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one last one. You talked a little bit about seasonality in deposits in Q1. How are you thinking
about overall balance sheet growth, balance sheet size in 2022? Is it more of a mix shift, or do you expect to grow
the balance sheet?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Well, deposits have been driving the balance sheet. It's all about deposits since loans are obviously far less than
our deposits right now. So, it's really a question of where the deposits go. And that's going to be highly
dependent, I think, on Fed actions. There are two primary things that will affect it. One will be rates because we
know, as rates go up, we'll see some of these deposit slip off balance sheet, off balance sheet money markets.
And I don't think that'll happen in the first couple hikes. It looks like money market rates are going to trail for a little
while here. But as rates progressively go up, you will see the deposits start to slip off.
And then what the Fed does with the balance sheet [indiscernible] (51:15) conversation, but all that's going to take
time. So, other than a little bit of a seasonal drop in the first quarter, I would say the first half of the year, you're
not going to see the balance sheet change much, deposits will stay strong. And then towards the second half of
the year, maybe more partway through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you'll start to see deposits come
down if the Fed moves as we think they will. But it's going to be a strong deposit level, no matter what. So,
funding is not a concern, and we think it's going to be a very healthy balance sheet going forward.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hello, Pete.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. Morning, Curt. I wanted to ask about capital. In the past, you've talked about that you
wanted to reduce some of the asset sensitivity before you would consider lowering the CET1 target. So, can you
just ballpark how much lower you would need to lower before maybe you consider lowering the capital target?
And then secondly, just as you near the capital target today of 10% and a better outlook for loan growth, just what
you're thinking about in terms of share buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. To the longer-term question of targeted capital ratios, that's really yet to be determined. We know that we
have almost 100 bps of preferred capacity to fill the stack with. I don't think that means we would necessarily one
for one lower our CET1 target by that same amount. But there would be a little bit of room there. But that
discussion is really a couple years away until we smooth out the asset sensitivities I've talked about in the past
and, obviously, an internal discussion and a discussion with the board and just the overall environment and the
status of some of our constituents and their views. So, more to come on that. But we do think there is that
potential, as we've mentioned in the past, to take CET1 lower once that net interest income stream has [ph]
smoothed out (53:20).
In terms of the more near term, ending at an estimated 10.15%, there's always a plus or minus 15 bps to where
you end up with the capital ratio. I really consider us to be about there. And I will say we are going to be cautious
in the near term about share repurchase. We're very hopeful. We feel good about loan growth over the next
several quarters. We think capital generation, meaning net income, is going to be very good especially if we get

rate rises. But that's not a guarantee. It hasn't happened yet. Yeah, we do think the loan growth is going to come.
So, we're going to be a little cautious on share buyback, and I think you'll see us hanging a little over 10% as
opposed to a little under 10% going forward. And we'll continue to monitor the environment for both capital
generation and where the loan growth might be headed over the next several quarters.

That's great. And then just one follow-up question. Just the deposit growth and Middle Market lending has been
really strong last few quarters. I'm just wondering, could you just talk about how much maybe is coming from new
customers and if you're doing anything differently to attract new business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Peter. It's Peter Sefzik. A portion of that is coming from new customers. I'd say it's probably 50/50 in Middle
Market. And I don't know that we're necessarily doing anything new. I do think our model is proving itself out,
though, in an environment with a lot of disruption. You have seen some acquisitions of banks in our markets. And
the reality is that we're benefiting from that, both with customers and with talent. So I think that all of those things
are kind of coming together and working really well in our favor and proving out the model nicely for Comerica.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, I might add that, we would say the same thing about our other business lines in Wealth Management and
in our Retail Bank that it's probably even split between existing customers and acquiring some new relationships
for some of the same reasons that Peter talked about.
The key for that, what I'm saying there though is that word relationship. We do not chase deposits from a pricing
standpoint. We really try to leverage relationship-based pricing and relationships overall in terms of deposit
growth. These are customers that we either have or customers that we're acquiring in terms of deposits, which is
part of why we've done a good job of maintaining or performing well from a beta standpoint. When you see a
rising rate environment as this is not hot money, these are really, relationship-based deposits across all three of
our businesses.

Morning, Steve.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Just following up on rate sensitivity. With the $14.9 billion in floors you have, just kind of
curious as to how in the money those floors are, just 25 basis points, 50 basis points, get some color around that?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Steve. It's Jim. Happy to take that. We do have the $14 billion of floors at an average rate of 67 bps. So,
how far they're in the money, you can just subtract monthly LIBOR from that. Most of our loans are on monthly
LIBOR. Those are hanging around, call it, 11 bps. You'd see a 56 bps in the money. But of course, that's going to
be dynamic as we go through the coming rate environment.
I mentioned floors as a bit of a headwind in terms of some of the bps received as well as the absolute amount
being realized on those floors. I think everyone understands out there that to the extent the Fed raises rates, it
really renders the floor issue a bit of a mood issue since eventually LIBOR will likely be equal to this level of floor
that we're getting. So, we think this is a challenge that may end up not being a challenge at all if the Fed moves
as everyone is expecting over the next couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of investment securities, just kind of curious what you're
seeking to purchase these days in terms of new money yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We're going to stick to our philosophy of buying high-quality securities where we understand the
prepayment stability characteristics, favorable capital treatment, no credit risk. So, we're not going to change from
the philosophy we have.
In terms of what those are yielding, it's really changed a lot even in the last week, so we'll see what the future
brings. You saw that in the fourth quarter, we were making purchases [ph] at 190 (58:07). We saw that take a
step up just a week ago, and we saw it take a much further step up just in the last day or two. So, we're
monitoring that very closely, but it certainly got the potential to create some nice opportunities for us in the coming
months and quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
