President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing some of our highlights
for the quarter and then discuss the regulatory matter that we've disclosed in our press release. John will then
take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023.
Last night, we've reported second quarter net income of $901 million or $3.54 per share. The quarter was
characterized by strong asset and deposit growth while credit is performing right in line with our expectations.
Importantly, we advanced several operational priorities this quarter.
One key milestone occurred in May when we relaunched our Cashback Debit product, we're excited by the
positive early results we're seeing so far. In the first few weeks, we opened over 30,000 new accounts and plan to
begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall. The relaunch advances our goal of becoming the
leading direct bank and over time, we expect Cashback Debit will be a significant entry point into the Discover
franchise.
We also continue to expand the Discover Global Network. This quarter, we announced five new partnerships in
the Asia Pacific region and added a new partnership with Guavapay in the UK. These strategic partnerships
underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance. And lastly, we continue to invest in our

human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as the 2023 Best Places to Work for people with
disabilities. This builds upon our recent recognitions as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Best
Workplaces for Parents and Best Workplaces for Women.
As you may have read in our press release last night, beginning around mid-2007, we incorrectly classified certain
card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. We are taking actions to correct this
card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and
acquirers. While the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material, it underscored deficiencies in our
corporate governance and risk management. We're in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters.
We've received a proposed consent order from the FDIC in connection with consumer compliance, which does
not cover the misclassification topic. We believe additional supervisory actions could occur. I want to emphasize
that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously. We've made significant progress and
investment in this area and look forward to working with our board and our regulators to achieve further
advancements.
Now I'll hand it over to John to review our results and updated outlook in more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to open by addressing the financial implications of the
card misclassification. We have established a liability on our balance sheet of $365 million to accrue for estimated
compensation owed to merchants and acquirers, in establishing the liability, we adjusted retained earnings by
$255 million net of tax. $11 million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue.
The first half 2023 impact was $22 million.
With that, I'll transition to our financial summary results on slide 4. From this, you can see that the financial
performance of the business remains solid. In the quarter, we reported net income of $901 million, which was
18% lower year-over-year. Our results reflect strong revenue growth, partially offset by a provision increase driven
by receivable growth and higher expenses. The trends for the quarter were robust loan growth, a low efficiency
ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology and strong capital and liquidity positions.
Further details are reflected on slide 5.
Net interest income was up $567 million year-over-year or 22%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at
11.06%, up 12 basis points from the prior year and down 28 basis points sequentially. The benefits from higher
prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances.
Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting a lower payment rate versus the
prior year and modest sales growth. The card payment rate remained stable quarter-over-quarter and about 200
basis points over 2019 levels. Sales volume grew 3% in the quarter. Through mid-July, growth continued to slow
and was up about 1%.
Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 27%, driven by strength in originations over the past
year. We continue to experience strong consumer demand, while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Deposit
growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our
direct-to-consumer balances grew $2 billion and consumer deposits made up 66% of our total funding mix. We
continue to target 70-plus percent of funding from deposits.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Looking at other revenue on slide 6. Non-interest income increased $98 million or 16%. This was partially due to a
$42 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $1 million gain this quarter.
Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by loan fee income.
Moving to expenses on slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $181 million or 15% year-over-year and up 2%
from the prior quarter, primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems. These
investments impacted several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation
costs were up $73 million or 14%, primarily due to increased head count. Marketing expense increased $14
million or 6% as we prudently invested for growth, particularly in our deposits and personal loan products. Our
commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed, and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the
high-30s.
Moving to credit performance on slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.22%, 142 basis points higher than the prior
year and up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Consistent with our expectation, we are seeing credit
normalization across all of our lending products. Looking ahead, in card, we continue to expect the seasoning of
new account vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this
year and into 2024.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserve by $373 million,
driven by our double-digit loan growth. Our reserve rate remained flat at 6.8%. Our outlook on the macro
economy has improved modestly. We continue to monitor economic conditions. We'll make adjustments to our
expectations as needed.
Looking at slide 10. Our capital position remains robust. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.7%, well
ahead of regulatory requirements. The cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to
the card misclassification reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. In the quarter, we
repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.70 per share.
As Roger indicated, we are reviewing our compliance, risk management and corporate governance and are in
discussions with our regulators on these topics. While this is ongoing, we have decided to pause share
repurchases.
Concluding on slide 11 with our outlook. There has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the
low to mid-teens. We are updating our NIM expectations to be around 11% for the full year, reflecting a
combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs. We are raising our
guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits. As previously indicated, we are seeing upward
pressure on expenses from the build-out of our compliance management systems. And we are lowering our
expected range of net charge-offs to 3.4% to 3.6% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates.
To wrap up, our business model continues to generate solid financial results, and our capital, funding and liquidity
positions remain strong. We continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance, enable us
to achieve excellence in all parts of our business.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Todd, to open the line for Q&A.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first
question from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. Look, I'd love to understand a little bit the link between what
you identified in terms of the miscalculation and then how that precipitated the sort of inquiry into governance and
consumer tracking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
The FDIC matter is not linked to the misclassification. And so the misclassification is a separate issue, the FDIC
matter is broadly around our compliance management system. It doesn't mean that the misclassification may not
result in further regulatory action, but I don't want to speculate on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And is the expectation when we've seen these in the past that they result in things like memorandum of
understanding and can do things like either constrained growth, limit repurchases and capital actions, how do you
see this playing out? And most importantly, I think what everybody really wants to know is, what is a reasonable
timeframe to get some further clarity here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I don't want to speculate on the timeframe of regulatory actions. I would say, to your point, though, they can
take many forms. And so we're working through the draft with our regulators, and we'll make more information
available and the consent order will itself be public once that's completed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. I realize there's – you have to be pretty circumspect about what you say here, so thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Hi. Thanks. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Just – I appreciate all the sensitivity around this and
understand you're pausing the buyback. I guess this is similar to what we saw last year in terms of regulatory
6

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
issue and getting ahead of the buyback – freezing the buyback. Just wondering maybe if there's a way to speak to
how these two issues kind of compared to the last year's student loan servicing issue maybe in terms of scoping
complexity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'll cover that piece and then maybe John can talk a bit about the buyback. So I would say the consent
order in student loan servicing was a compliance matter. And so I think there is a link between that and the
broader focus on our compliance management system. With that, maybe I'll let John talk a bit about the buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Great. And – thanks, Roger. And as it relates to the buyback, we had robust conversations internally whether or
not to pause the buyback and what management recommended to the board was that we paused the buyback as
we work through the details of these compliance and risk management issues and are in conversations with our
regulator.
I want to reiterate the following, though. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. So first invest in the
business in growth and certainly through this year and into next year into compliance and risk management. And
second, the priority will be to return excess capital to shareholders. So no change in terms of the two primary
capital allocation priorities.
I also want to focus your attention on to the strong capital generation that the business delivered in the quarter
and has delivered historically. So we're hoping that we kind of work through these issues in an expedited fashion,
but timing, I can't be specific on. So, would that – the buyback will provide as much clarity on the timing of
resumption when we have information on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you. And just maybe shifting gears a bit here. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on what
you're seeing in the consumer in your book today. Could you maybe also give us an update on the spend
trajectory you've been seeing so far in July? I know you talked about the growth rate slowing down to 3% in recent
months, wondering if we're seeing something similar from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So it has slowed down further so far in July, so probably closer to 1%. Not necessarily as bad as it sounds
in terms of the health of the consumer because you've got some very challenging comps compared to last year's
growth as well as the very, very high level of new accounts we put on last year.
And I think overall, in terms of payment side, delinquencies and losses, as John said, are sort of normalizing right
on the path we thought they were and here, I think the strength of the job market is very constructive for our sort
of prime consumer base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Roger, again, I know that we're probably eliminating what we could say here on the compliance side. But I guess
just a broader question. Can you maybe just help us understand what are the areas that you feel that the
company has underinvested in and maybe just give us a framework for what you guys are doing internally to fix
these? I understand that John had talked about raising costs, but can you give us a little bit more color in terms of
what the investments you're making and what you think the time line is to get these done?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. John can maybe provide more color on the time line. I would say it's a multiyear, but it's also something that
we have been investing in over the last couple of years. So as you think about your compliance management
system, it's everything from risk identification, sort of process mapping, building controls or change management
processes, the resources you have around risk management in the first line, the resources you have in the
second line in terms of the compliance function, testing, the internal audit, your governance processes. And so we
are determined to be as strong on the compliance side and it's excellent there as we are around customer
experience, data and analytics, every other aspect of our business model. So this is our top priority and the
investment is both on the technology side, outside consultants, but also in terms of head count here at Discover.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And then – hey Ryan, on the trajectory. And so I made this comment publicly about month and a half ago.
2019 to 2023, we increased our spend in compliance and I'll say, tangential items to ensure compliance works as
we wish it to work. I indicated it was about an increase of $250 million as we relooked at it. We were going to
accelerate that spend at probably $300 million increase from 2019 and a $200 million increase, 2022 to 2023.
Now the implications for that on 2024, where we sit today, we expect once we achieve that level in 2023 to be
relatively consistent into 2024. And then as we kind of shape this piece of our business into something that we
desire or regulator's desire and our shareholders deserve, we expect that expense burn to reduce.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Appreciate all that color. And then maybe just on credit. I think Roger might have talked about the normalization of
the front book as well as expectations for the back book to continue to normalized, but you took the credit loss
range down a bit. So can you maybe just talk about, one, where you're seeing the improved performance? And
John, as you look out – maybe just talk about your confidence in the curve on losses bending as we approach
sort of the midpoint of next year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great. So, yeah, the tightening of the range was reflective of a couple of things. So first, as time moves on,
we get more and more comfort with our forecasting on it. And to-date, our forecasting has been right on top of
actuals or actuals have been right on top of the forecast. So that gave us comfort.
Second is as time goes on, we can move from the analytical model to a more kind of traditional roll rate model
that gives us a greater level of comfort around the charge-off and delinquency rates, 30 days out to 180 days out.
So that gave us comfort to tighten that range. And then on top of that, certainly, the jobs data and the forecast
around employment, gave us additional comfort.
In terms of what we're seeing with the portfolio, exactly what I said in the prepared comments. So the newer
vintages seasoning to expectation and older vintages basically normalizing to kind of 2019 levels. In terms of the
shape of curve, what we expect charge-offs to do in the back half of this year is the acceleration in terms of the
rate of charge-off to begin to slow and currently, we're expecting kind of charge-offs to peak in the second half of
2024. It may push a little bit into 2025. But right now, we're seeing it in the second half of 2024 and then reach a
level which likely will stabilize that for two to three quarters after.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for all the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Morning, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. First one is that we've talked about you've given us some sort
of good trajectory of the normalization of the credit trends, which, I guess, occurs later this year, early into next
year. I'm wondering, given kind of the comps and stabilization of inflation and so forth, when do you expect to see
normalization of loan growth and your guys' opinions, what is kind of the normalized level of loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, certainly, real robust loan growth in the first half of this year and the last quarter of 2022. We expect the
rate of increase to slow certainly in the third and fourth quarter and also against really, really strong comps from
2022. And traditionally, what this business has delivered is loan growth somewhere between two and four times
GDP growth. Now, we don't know what GDP is going to look like right now into 2024. But I would say this, we did

cut the edges on the lower credit quality, which will impact new account growth in card for the balance of this
year.
We're seeing, as Roger indicated, and I mentioned in my comments, sales growth to slow and probably stabilize
in the single digits. So that will also impact loan growth for the balance of this year and into next year. So the
stabilized number is a multiple of GDP typically, unless there's some change to the macros that indicates it's a
good investment to either open up credit or appropriate to tighten credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's a helpful framework to think about. And then with respect to the expense guide, I think you talked
about some investment in compliance and some investment in technology and so forth. I'm wondering, is there –
maybe talk about the competitive climate at this point relative to the past few years? Is there any spending
required from a competitive perspective? Or do you have any – can you characterize the overall competitive
environment as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I think we continue to see good results from the money we put to work on the marketing front in terms of our cost
per account. Obviously, we've talked about the relaunch of Cashback Debit. We'll put some money against that,
including the mass market campaign in the fall, but have been excited with what we're seeing in terms of the cost
per funded account there. So while the competitive environment is always intense across all of our businesses,
we feel good about how our value proposition is competing out there across all of our consumer products.

John Hecht Q

All right, guys. Thanks very much.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. John, I was wondering if you could talk on the merchant miscalculation. Was that found internally, or was that
brought to you by a regulator or a third-party?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
It was found internally.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then on NIM, it sounded like the trajectory was pretty good in general, and now it's going to be
around 11%. Is there more promotional than you thought or more deposit competition? Can you talk a bit about
that?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. It's a little bit of both actually. So we ended 2022 at 11.04%. We said that we would be, in our initial
guidance, up modestly. And then, in the first quarter call, we said NIM had likely peaked and then it would begin
to move downward and, what I'll say, normalize, likely to a higher level than it has been historically.
So in the quarter, the reason that we tweaked that guidance was we are investing in promotional balances, so
attracting new customers or building balances with existing customers. Now the returns on those offers are
fantastic. The impact on NIM in the short-term in the promotional period, it's minor, but given our activity there, it
took a few points of net interest margin out, and we thought that was an important impact to communicate.
Second, in terms of deposit competition, we had said that we thought the beta would come in somewhere around
60% to 70%. What we've seen in – late in the first quarter and into this quarter was our competitive set being
more aggressive in terms of price increases.
And as I've communicated in the past, we don't seek to be a price leader here. We try to compete on our brand,
our customer offering, our digital assets that are first class in order to attract deposit customers. And we've been
very successful, as you can tell by the numbers there.
But part of the proposition is also price. So what we're seeing now is beta is likely to be north of 70%, which is
impacting net interest margin to the extent I just talked about in the guidance point. So those two factors are
playing most substantially on the revised outlook.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up on a couple of the points made on the consent order. Maybe the first
one, just on the share repurchase pause. Is that action taken in terms of prudence or out of an abundance of
caution? Or do you think that there could be a material impact to your capital position? And I guess, secondly, just
on – John, you talked about the pressures on expenses into 2024. I guess like are there – is there leverage on
other expense lines to sort of moderate the overall implications for the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So the decision on the share repurchase was out of prudence. We have done a number of
tests internally stressing a number of factors, so that, for example, the CCAR process we go through includes
extreme stress. We tested that off and ran some simulations and the output of that was that both capital and
liquidity, even in an extreme situation, remain well above regulatory requirements. So we feel comfortable about
our capital and liquidity.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
The issue on the share repurchase was, again, out of prudence given what we have going on in the organization,
and we wanted to make sure that our actions are consistent with the right message in terms of being conservative
and dealing with the first level of priority.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
In terms of expense leverage, we continue to look at all of the lines and all of the investments we make in are
expense based. And the incident management situation we're dealing with in terms of resources to get that under
control. That's a significant investment. So resources supplement technology, people and consultants, certainly
an investment.
On the indirect side, we continue to leverage our procurement organization and ensure that first, we concentrate
on demand management and second, on making sure there's a fair value exchange. So that's the plan right now
and will be the plan through the balance of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. I guess a follow-up just for Roger. I know you've gotten this question in the past, and I'm just thinking about
the higher teasers and such. I mean, what makes you comfortable growing sort of mid-teens, high-teens, above
the really strong lapping of very strong growth a year ago. I mean, I'm just thinking about just the complexion of
the accounts you're bringing in that makes you very comfortable here because it's obviously having some
implications on the NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Good question, Sanjay. You have seen that growth start to slow a bit. And I think it isn't necessarily that far
out of line with what you're seeing from our other, I'd say, sophisticated, prime-focused competitors. It is really
strong demand for the product. And as we've been clear, we have been tightening not loosening credit and are
watching the accounts we both very carefully.
And so we're always ready to make adjustments, whether it's on the card product, the personal loan or elsewhere.
But again, we feel good and are closely monitoring the performance. Within the credit, we're making adjustments
continuously, both on the portfolio side and the new account side. But these are very strong new accounts we're
bringing in. And I think part of it is the differentiated value proposition that Discover offers continues to resonate

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the expenses, in particular. You said you
continue to target efficiency ratio in the high-30s. Could there be a time where you may have to make additional
investments, particularly around compliance that would have you go above the high-30s efficiency ratio for a short
period of time before returning back to it just given the near-term impacts of both additional marketing spend on
the debit account and the compliance issues? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with what we shared in terms of low-double-digit expense
growth this year. We've taken a preliminary look at next year. We'll share that at an appropriate time after we kind
of review and get our plan approved by our board. But I'm feeling like it's very, very achievable, and that's why we
enunciated that target or that goal. But I would say this, as we see opportunities to grow profitably and no
contradiction to Roger's point earlier about the demand for our products but we'll continue to take a look and
invest for the medium term and longer term. And we're going to do that on the growth side. We're focused right
now on the compliance side. And we'll dial each of the expense levers in order to ensure we achieve the results
that our shareholders want that our board expects and that the management team expects.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Are there any particular areas where you see the most opportunity to create efficiencies, whether it's marketing or
head count or anything out there that you see that can allow you to continue to hit your goals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we're investing in advanced analytics that we're driving efficiencies in our rewards cost. We continue to
look at third-party spend and have achieved great results in terms of year-over-year reduction in unit costs. The
situation this year is that – we've invested heavily in resources people. So we're up – we're about up about 3,000
people this year. So when you bring on additional people, both in collections and customer service as well as
salary personnel, there's other costs that go along with it.
So as we manage through this situation, I continue to believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiencies by
combining like activities, taking a look at how resources are deployed organizational structures and over time,
optimizing that. But right now, with the situation we're in, we've decided that the first priority is get the right
resources in to focus on the issues we've talked about. And then we're going to be able to drive efficiencies in the
future.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Hi. Good morning, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start maybe just on the business and the
application quality of new applicants that you're seeing. I think you mentioned in response to John's question,
tightening underwriting, I guess, firstly, was that a new action you took in the second quarter?
And then just related to that tightening of underwriting and application quality, I was wondering just if you – I know
you've talked in the past about actively monitoring the health of the consumer and the portfolio. Was there
something you're seeing that is flashing red or caution that's making you tighter underwriting further here, or – just
trying to understand the demand environment, who's applying for a new loan currently, what's driving some of the
underwriting changes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Good question. So the tightening was not in the second quarter and was not in response to something
we're seeing. And actually, in terms of applicant quality, whether it's for home equity, personal loans, student loan
or in card, where we're seeing very stable characteristics in terms of average FICO, in terms of the custom scores
we use. So it was – series of changes we made, I would say, in prior quarters, but a lot of stability in terms of the
quality of applicant over the course of this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then maybe switching gears to the debit product that was relaunched. Can you talk just longer term
strategically, what is the – I guess, the thinking behind that product, what is the goal? Is the idea there hey, this is
an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers and lower? And how will that benefit you? Will it be through
better NIM because they're offering rewards, you [ph] may not (00:41:43) necessarily need to offer as higher
interest rate, like just talk a little bit more strategically about why that product makes sense to invest in for
Discover and how you expect the growth trajectory of that product to go over the next few quarters here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah, great question. So our aspiration is to be the leading digital bank. And so when you think about a digital
bank, you think about the core DDA or debit product, and because we have a proprietary network, we can offer
rewards in debit in a way no other large bank can and it builds on our heritage around cash back and as the
inventor of credit card rewards.
So it's not just to cross-sell to our card customers. We think that this can pretty quickly become a significant entry
point into the franchise for new customers. And then, over time, much as we've done on the card side, if you can
provide a superior value proposition and customer experience, they will want to buy other products from you
whether that's a savings account and savings accounts where you also have the checking account then to have a
lower beta or the card product.
So again, a very important initiative for us, I think over time, will help continue transforming Discover. And we're
excited for the potential. And you'll see significant marketing against it this fall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just my last question, just coming back to the compliance issue. Look, I appreciate it's difficult to
provide too many details right now. But maybe just on the timing, give us some frame of reference, like given that
14

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
this is – it sounds like the FDIC consent order also is related to compliance issues. You have the student loan
issue, now you have this issue. Does that entail a much longer review period? Or do you think this can go pretty
quickly like a quarter or two to go through?
I mean, again, I'm not saying when you resume buybacks, but at least like when you expect the review to be
complete, what are you trying to – how quickly are you trying to complete the review internally? And then I
understand maybe the buyback discussion probably involves regulators and could be – it's a little bit harder to
size, but at least a review maybe you can tell us what your target is for like when you're trying to complete the
review?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And to frame the compliance issue, I would not over focus on the regulatory portion. This is something
where we, as a team, know we are not where we want to be, and it is our top priority. So it is aligned with the
views of the regulators, but our focus is taking many forms from simplifying our architecture, automating manual
processes, streamlining and standardizing business processes, bring on some great new talent, as John talked
about, into the firm.
And we know that the result will not just be better compliance, but a better customer experience, a more efficient
organization. So the regulatory piece is important. But I would say what most important is the commitment from
me, the team, the board, on achieving excellence in this area. That will be a multiyear initiative. But again, I think,
critically important to the future of the company and one that we, as a team, are very excited about. I would also
separate that from the buyback. But again, it will be a journey on the compliance side, but one that we are 100%
committed to.

Mihir Bhatia Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Holowko Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more around the consent order and
compliance issues. As you think about the operational complexity of the businesses you operate in and as you go
through your view looking into these issues, do you feel like there may be an opportunity to take a closer look at
some of the businesses you operate in, whether that might be student loans or anywhere else? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'll talk maybe more broadly about operational complexity and then John can talk about the businesses. I
think there's a great opportunity to simplify whether it's – we may have a similar process that is done frankly. And
again, we have a much more, I would say, homogenous set of businesses than just about any other bank of our
size. So we think there are significant opportunities to simplify. And again, those won't just help from a compliance
standpoint over time once the investments are made, it will also help on the efficiency side.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And then regarding our businesses and products, we think about this in line with our capital allocation
priorities, our connections to our customer base and what we can manage and manage well. So we [ph] didn't
(00:47:09) start today. Historically, we've looked at all our products, our returns. And as we look at those, we've
made decisions to invest in order to drive growth or achieve compliance excellence. So we're going to continue to
look at that. And if something is below our return targets, then we'll fix it and invest or we'll look at other
alternatives. But certainly, the focus today is to take our existing products, make sure they're a good offering that
we can deliver those in a compliant way and drive a good return for our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Holowko Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for taking my question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you and good morning. Just from a big picture perspective, with the competitive environment, the
compliance environment. Roger, as you look at your business, what is your confidence that Discover can deliver
the types of returns that it has that investors have come used to over the last 10 to 20 years? Is there – are you
confident in delivering those returns with the higher compliance bar or the competitive set?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'd start by saying yes, right. This is an investment we need to make. It is the top priority for the company,
but one that I think we will be able to do to fix. And again, over time, we'll see benefits not just in compliance, but
in a better customer experience as well as more efficient.
If you step way back, I've never been more excited about Discover's business model and how it compares. I think
you're seeing the strength of our deposit franchise at a time when many banks are being tested. We have the
scale and resources to compete with anyone. We're making the investments to be at the leading edge around
data and analytics.
Our winning awards for our customer experience on not only just the card side, but also our deposit products. We
have the relaunch of Cashback Debit. So in terms of the business model and the returns we can give to our
owners, in my 25 years at Discover, I've never been more excited. To get to all of that, though, we need to get to
where we need to be on the compliance standpoint. And that's a critical part of operating a bank, a financial
services organization. We are not where we need to be, and we are going to get there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Follow-up, just on compliance, having followed Discover for a very long time, coming out of the great
financial crisis, there was a lot – big investment in compliance across the industry, including at Discover. Has it
become more difficult? I mean, I know there's been a number – quite a few consent orders put out by regulators.
16


Discover Financial Services

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
But has it become – maybe give us some color on what you're investing in compliance today, if it's people or
percentage of expenses versus historically? And has it become a lot more difficult?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. It certainly is a challenging environment, but I'm not going to blame that, right? As I look back, I do believe
we underinvested and that's something I take accountability for, but we are very focused on it now. And as John, I
think, highlighted that investment takes many forms, right, from bringing in some highly talented folks within the
compliance area, building out our monitoring and controls, investments on the technology side to standardize,
simplify, automate manual processes. As you think about it, compliance and a lot of the focus, it's risk
management, right?
And traditionally, we have been very strong around credit risk management, around liquidity risk management but
have not necessarily made the investments we needed, especially as the complexity of our business increased.
As we got into more new products, I think there was a gap there in terms of our capabilities. And that's what we're
focused on now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. On the net charge-off peak that you highlighted for into second half of 2024 and possibly into 2025, is
that an expectation that it would go north of kind of your normal underwriting charge-off rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, Arren. No. I mean, we gave the charge-off range. Now there's a numerator and denominator impact on
that calculation, of course. But our underwriting is focused on prime revolver. Prime revolver behavior in our
targeted segments looks very, very consistent to where it's been historically.
And our return expectations remain high. And we've been able to deliver on that. So in terms of – is it going to be
north and where it was historically? We have seasoning of those new vintages, but our credit box has been
relatively consistent.
Our analytics to kind of target customers and understand kind of risk factors, I feel like has improved over the four
years I've been here and certainly a longer journey than that. So the trajectory to me looks very, very comfortable
in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high returns and generate capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then just to clarify on the expense commentary, it sounds like you're not planning to pull back
on marketing opportunities as your compliance costs are rising. And then if you could just clarify the numbers that
17


Discover Financial Services
(DFS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
you gave earlier. Are those annual numbers? I think you said like $50 million up to $250 million and then $350
million and then down to $200 million. I was just a little confused on the trajectories there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Trajectory of the compliance management cost?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
...was that your question, Arren, or overall? Yeah. So I'll start with marketing and I'll focus on the compliance
second. We haven't made a decision to pull back on marketing. We still see opportunity to generate positive
returns from the customers that we're targeting in that prime revolver segment.
And we're also putting money towards helping people understand our deposit products and hopefully find that
we're compelling there. We also have the campaign on the Cashback Debit program slated for the second half of
the year. So the marketing dollars, how we thought about them at the beginning of the year remains consistent
with where we are today.
And frankly, I think it would have been shortsighted to pull back in order to manage to a particular number given
the high returns we're able to generate there.
In terms of the compliance cost, what I was referencing was 2019 to where we are in 2023. And so about a month
ago, in a public forum, I said that that increase from 2019 to 2023 was about $250 million. As we've looked at the
work in front of us, we're dedicating an incremental probably $20 million to $30 million, maybe as much as $50
million over and above that here. So it could be the delta from 2019, not $250 million, but maybe as much as
$300 million. Year-over-year, so 2022 to 2023, we're up about $200 million in total compliance and related costs.
Does that provide clarity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes. Yes, I got it now. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey, great. Good morning, everybody. So when I look at your loan growth guidance, you talk about low to mid-
teens. And to me, that means 14% basically. And so if you think about 14% or that range that you're discussing, it
18


Discover Financial Services
(DFS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
would indicate the second half loan growth would be roughly 7%. And given the trajectory of loan growth in
general, it would end spending being at 2.5% this quarter, moving to 1% in the most recent month, it would
suggest the fourth quarter's loan growth would be probably low-single-digits or something along those lines to
make that guidance range. And so I was just curious if that's the right math that you are thinking about or roughly,
if we could talk about that, that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I learned a long time ago not to give quarterly guidance because I found that I was not as accurate as I
would have liked and other people would have liked. So the range of kind of the double-digit growth that we talked
about, you can take a look at the portfolio. We made some comments on what was driving it.
So new accounts and certainly new account growth 2022 to 2023 has slowed, sales while still very robust at an
absolute level, have slowed into July. We're doing targeted promotional activities to drive high generating, high
returning accounts. And the comp in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus prior quarters is certainly a tougher comp.
So your math is certainly your math, and I don't want to get into any more specifics than what I just did.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
No problem. Thanks a lot. And then there are some signs that the national unemployment rate could start to move
higher. If you look at some of the state data, if you saw seasoning and the unemployment rate rising at the same
time, could it have a more additive effect for ultimately higher net charge-offs than otherwise the book without the
seasoning effect? And maybe just to relate to that, your loan fee income has been quite robust in its growth and it
beat our expectations by quite a lot this quarter? Is that kind of an indication of the seasoning effects that are
going on with the late fees in that bucket?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Arren (sic) [Dominick], the answer to both questions is yes. So the loan fee income typically late fees and
NSF fees, and in terms of employment levels, if unemployment was to increase, that would certainly impact net
charge-offs. But I would say this, in the cohort of folks that we typically target, what we've seen is if they are
impacted by a job situation, their time of recovery is pretty quick. So by recovery, I mean finding a new role. So
the fact that this cohort of prime revolvers isn't in the upper tier of income levels allows them to have a greater
opportunity to find jobs of equal pay – equal or more pay in the current environment.
So the employment – early indications of employment or some challenges in some states. We don't see any sign
of that translating into a credit situation for us.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Great. I'm going to sneak one more in here. Is the Discover spending growth has typically matched its loan
growth trajectory over time given the stability of your business model, if we don't see a normalization and
meaningful fashion of payment rates, is there any reason that the spending growth and loan growth trajectories
would be uncorrelated as they have been in the past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we'll look at kind of opportunities to drive loan growth. And part of that is the sales data, the spending
data from consumers. And reflect that in our next set of guidance that we provide. But specific in correlation in this
form, I'm not going to get into.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Ryan Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for working me in here at the end. Question on the personal loans business. Last quarter,
you talked about that there were some marginal tightening that you did, but you had fairly robust loan growth this
quarter. Could you talk about the market opportunity that you're seeing there? And also the mix of new versus
existing customers. I believe the historical mix was about 50-50. Just curious if that's still the case.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So in terms of overall competition, I'd say there's been a little bit of a pullback on the supply from side I
would say markets and others as they pulled out. But there are a good number of competitors, a lot of them are
much more broader spectrum than us in terms of how far down they go. I think what you're seeing is really strong
consumer demand. As rates have gone up and our product is primarily used for debt consolidation, people are
looking to consolidate and pay down their credit cards. And so we're seeing very strong demand that is giving us
the ability to tighten credit and even at the margin, raise our prices and still see strong demand.
So it's a product where underwriting and credit is everything. The mix is largely new, but a good amount, are
cross-sold to our existing cardholder base. So it's customers where we also have experience with that.
