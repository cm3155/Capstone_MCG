Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
The economy in the first quarter was relatively strong despite the surge of COVID cases in January and the war in
Ukraine. On the whole, our customers are in good shape and they remain cautiously optimistic about the future.
Loan growth in the first quarter was solid and exceeded our expectations in several businesses. Compared to the
first quarter last year, general Middle Market average loans were up 16% excluding PPP loans, and large
corporate loans were up 20%. Credit quality remained very strong and expenses were well-controlled. We are
actively managing our balance sheet and remain well-positioned for the rising rate environment. Overall, the year
is off to a good start.
Highlighted on the slide are recent accomplishments associated with our corporate responsibility platform. We are
pleased with the progress we are making. Related to environmental sustainability, climate risk is an emerging
priority for all regulators. And last month the SEC released a notice of proposed rulemaking for climate-related
disclosures. For the past 13 years, we have disclosed our progress in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse
gas emissions, discussing our goals in our annual Corporate Responsibility reports, and providing annual
responses to CDP's climate change questionnaire.

We will be publishing our Corporate Responsibility report in June. Through our membership and the Partnership
for Carbon Accounting Financials or PCAF, we have begun to develop estimates of our commercial lending
portfolio's financed emissions. We expect to continue on this path and meet any reporting or regulatory
requirements. We look forward to keeping your apprised of our progress.
In light of the evolving post-COVID environment, we are taking a fresh look at our retail banking approach,
corporate facilities, and technology platform. These are areas that we are constantly evaluating. But with the pace
of change accelerating, we are acting with even more urgency. For example, within our Retail Bank, we continue
to focus on transforming the delivery of our services, aligning resources to best serve our customers, and
enhancing our small business focus. Also, we are developing additional initiatives around optimizing our facilities
for our employees. The goal is to better accommodate flexible work arrangements, reduce our footprint, and
improve efficiency while maximizing locations to best serve our customers.
As far as technology, we are increasingly focused on ways to meet customers and colleagues' rapidly increasing
desire to utilize digital channels. We believe these initials initiatives are essential and foundational to continuing to
effectively execute our relationship banking strategy as we have for the past 173 years.
Turning to our first quarter results, which are outlined on slide 4, we generated earnings of $1.37 per share. Solid,
broad-based loan growth momentum was partly offset by a large decrease in Mortgage Banker due to lower refi
volumes and typical first quarter slower purchase volume as well as the continued wind down of PPP loans.
Deposits in the first quarter are typically impacted by seasonality, and this year was no exception following record
activity in the fourth quarter.
Net interest income benefited from loan growth as well as our larger securities portfolio as we work to deploy
excess liquidity and lock in higher yields. These benefits were offset by a $10 million decline in PPP income.
Strong credit quality resulted in a small reserve release. As expected, maintain the record levels of fee income we
generated last year was challenging, The first quarter was impacted by a large decline in warrant-related income
and negative returns from deferred compensation assets. In addition, we saw a seasonal decline in customer
activity intensified by Omicron in January. We believe activity should be more robust as we move through the
year. Expenses declined $13 million and included the decrease in deferred comp and seasonality in several
categories such as annual stock compensation.
Overall, companies are working on growing their businesses, rebuilding inventory levels, and increasing capital
expenditures despite higher costs and labor shortages. In general, customers have been able to pass on price
increases and their balance sheets are strong with excess liquidity. Despite some uncertainty, customer
sentiment remains positive, which is reflected in our pipeline and growing loan commitment levels.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim who will review the quarter in more detail.

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 5, as Curt just mentioned, we had solid, broad-based loan growth, which was partly offset by an
$852 billion decline in Mortgage Banker and a $354 million decrease in PPP loans. Loan commitments increased
in most businesses and the line utilization rate held steady at about 46%. Positive trends continued in general
Middle Market and Corporate Banking, which both grew over $400 million. Excluding PPP, general Middle Market

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
loans increased $562 million or 5%. Higher commodity prices and growing inventory levels are in part resulting in
increasing working capital needs. M&A and CapEx are also drivers.
We continue to have great success in our equity funds services business where we provide capital call and
subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms. The pipeline is strong and the activity remains high.
The increase in National Dealer Services loans included a small increase in floor plan loans, which totaled a little
over $600 million and remains extraordinarily low relative to the typical historical run rate of about $4 billion. We
expect it will take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolved and pent-up demand is
satisfied.
Environmental Services continue to build on the strong growth we've seen over the past year. Opportunities are
abundant and we continue to attract new relationships, resulting in record loans and strong syndication activity.
Mortgage Banker declined significantly as refi activity slowed with higher rates and home sales fell to seasonal
levels. However, we expect to see an increase in purchase activity as we enter the spring selling season. Also,
housing supply is expected to grow as we progress through the year. We believe we are well-positioned as 71%
of our mix is purchase related.
Loan yields decreased 4 basis points as the benefit from higher rates was more than offset by lower PPP
revenue. As the bulk of our portfolio is floating rate and largely reprices at the end of the month, the full benefit of
the recent rate increase is expected to be reflected in the second quarter.
As shown on slide 6, average deposits declined in the first quarter mostly due to seasonality. This follows record
deposit growth in the fourth quarter when we had the highest quarter-over-quarter growth rate amongst our peers.
Deposits are up 11% year-over-year, and we believe deposits will remain elevated but slowly decline as the Fed
increases interest rates and significantly shrinks its balance sheet. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits
remained at an all-time low of 5 basis points. With the loan-to-deposit ratio for us and our peers at low levels, we
expect deposit rates to adjust slowly as rates rise.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. Our goal is to prudently reduce our asset sensitivity as rates
rise. In part, this can be achieved through deploying excess liquidity by opportunistically growing the securities
book. Through the first quarter we purchased $3.6 billion worth of securities with average yields of about 250
basis points with recent purchases exceeding 300 basis points. A larger portfolio and, to a lesser extent, favorable
new purchase yields resulted in a $6 million increase in securities income. Holding balances and rates steady at
the March 31 level, second quarter securities revenue would increase to about $90 million. We will continue to
assess relative value between MBS and swaps as we execute our balance sheet hedging, potentially leading to
some incremental growth in the portfolio although likely at a reduced pace.
The rise in rates resulted in a mark-to-market impact of $965 million, which runs through OCI and affects our book
value, but not our regulatory capital ratios. This accounting treatment does not capture the significant economic
value created by higher rates on other parts of our balance sheet that are not marked such as deposits. Of note,
we typically hold the securities to maturity. In which case, the unrealized losses should be recouped.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income decreased $5 million, including a $10 million decline in PPP income. The
net interest margin increased 15 basis points, mainly due to a decrease in excess liquidity. As far as the details,
the decline in PPP income, two fewer days in the quarter, and lower nonaccrual activity together had a $19 million
impact. This was partly offset by growth in non-PPP loans, which added $5 million. The benefit from higher rates
was $4 million and included a partial offset from lower rates on floors. With the average rate on floors now at 59
basis points, floor has become less relevant as rates rise.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
As I mentioned, the increase in the size of the securities portfolio at higher yields added $6 million. The decrease
in balances at the Fed reduced net interest income by $1 million and added 17 basis points to the margin. Fed
deposits remain high at over $17 billion and weighed heavily on the margin with an impact of 52 basis points.
As far as credit, which is outlined on slide 9, our metrics remained excellent, including net charge-offs of only 6
basis points. Gross charge-offs declined while recoveries decreased from elevated levels of recent quarters.
Criticized and nonaccrual loans remained low. Our provision was a credit of $11 million. Sustained strong credit
metrics and a continuing favorable economic forecasts, albeit with elements of uncertainty, resulted in a modest
reduction in the allowance for credit losses to 1.21% of loans.
Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator. With our
consistent, disciplined approach to credit, we believe we could continue to outperform in the event we encounter a
recessionary environment. We are closely monitoring the portfolio, looking for potential signs of stress from supply
chain disruptions, labor constraints, and inflation. Overall, our customers have been able to manage through
these challenges, performing well and maintaining their strong balance sheets.
Noninterest income is outlined on slide 10. Warrant-related income decreased $14 million following elevated
gains on monetizations in the fourth quarter. In addition, deferred comp, which is offset in expenses, decreased
$12 million to a negative $7 million. Derivative income declined $5 million due to a $6 million change to the credit
valuation adjustment, mostly related to higher energy prices impacting our customers' positions.
Several customer-related categories which reached record levels in the fourth quarter were challenged by
seasonal factors, market performance, and a slower economic environment in January attributed to Omicron. This
included a decline in commercial lending fees, particularly syndications, fiduciary income and card. As Curt
mentioned, we believe activity will improve as we progress through the year.
We continue to maintain our expense discipline as we position for the future growth, as shown on slide 11. Total
expenses decreased $13 million in the quarter. Salaries and benefits decreased $3 million, including the $12
million decrease in deferred comp which is offset in noninterest income. Performance-based incentives were
lower as we reset targets to normal levels. Seasonal factors included annual stock comp, higher payroll taxes and
lower staff insurance. Of note, our staff levels increased slightly as we are successfully retaining and attracting
talent in a very competitive market.
Occupancy and advertising were seasonally lower. Also, legal expenses declined following elevated year-end
activity. Lower outside processing is partly related to slower card activity and operational losses in FDIC
expenses, which are difficult to predict, were at elevated levels.
We kicked off certain initiatives related to modernization, as Curt described, which increased expenses by $6
million, specifically related to consulting, severance and asset impairment. This is a journey which includes
transformation of our retail banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and technology optimization.
We look forward to providing more information as these initiatives form. The cost savings generated are expected
to be reinvested as we continue to evolve. As always, our goal is to prudently manage expenses while enhancing
our customers' and colleagues' experiences.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. Loan and securities portfolio growth, the impact from customer
derivatives combined with share repurchases resulted in a decrease in our CET1 ratio to an estimated 9.93%. We
continue to closely monitor loan trends and capital generation as we focus on our 10% target. As always, our
6

priority is to use our capital to support our capitals and – customers and drive growth while providing an attractive
return to shareholders.
Slide 13 provides an overview of our interest rate sensitivity and the benefit of the rising rate environment. Our
standard model assumes a non-parallel rise in rates with a dynamic balance sheet. Based on the balance sheet
as of March 31, we estimate a $160 million increase in annual net interest income over 12 months as rates
gradually rise 100 basis points and the benefit will be slightly greater again in year two.
We've also provided various alternative scenarios. For the purpose of providing an outlook, for 2022 net interest
income, we added the expected 50-basis-point rise in May using swaps and securities at March 31 levels and our
outlook for loan and deposit activity for the remainder of the year. In this scenario, we expect net interest income
to increase by more than 13% relative to 2021 and increase 15% in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.
Our outlook for 2022 is on slide 14 and assumes the economy remains strong, with gradual improvement of
supply chain and labor challenges. Aside from the significant upside from rates, our outlook for the full year is
unchanged from our January earnings call. There is no change in our expectation for broad-based average loan
growth on a year-over-year basis in the mid-single-digit range, excluding the decline in PPP loans.
This includes a decline in Mortgage Banker from the continued normalization of refi volumes and lower National
Dealer due to a slow rebound as a result of supply chain issues. Including PPP, average loans year-over-year are
expected to be stable. This outlook reflects our robust pipeline and positive momentum in many businesses.
Relative to the first quarter, we expect average loans to grow 1% to 2% each quarter, with a seasonal pickup in
Mortgage Banker along with growth in nearly every business line.
Post the seasonal decline in the first quarter, our base assumption is that deposits are expected to modestly
decline for the remainder of the year, with modest growth in Wealth Management and Retail more than offset by a
moderate decline in Commercial deposits. However, the magnitude may be impacted by the pace of Fed
tightening and economic trends as these are major drivers for deposits.
I already reviewed our net interest income expectations, but note that rate increases beyond May and the growth
of our securities and swap portfolios present additional upside. Credit quality is expected to remain strong with net
charge-offs continuing to trend to the lower end of our normal 20 basis points to 40 basis points. Assuming
sustained economic strength and the impacts from supply chain issues, labor constraints and inflation remain
manageable, we expect criticized and nonaccrual loans to remain low.
As far as noninterest income, there is no change to our outlook. 2021 was the highest on record and the level of
some categories are unlikely to repeat in 2022 such as warrant-related activity, derivative income including
favorable CVA, stimulus-related card fees and deferred compensation. For the remainder of the year, we expect
significant broad-based growth in customer-driven fee categories as activity picks up.
This includes card, deposit service charges, commercial lending fees, warrants as well as fiduciary, which
benefits from tax filings in the second quarter. In addition, deferred comp and securities gains and losses are
difficult to predict. Therefore, we assume will not repeat. We continue to expect low-single-digits increase in 2022
expenses. Second quarter expenses are expected to be relatively stable relative to the first quarter.
Salary and benefits are expected to decrease modestly as the first quarter annual stock comp and lower payroll
taxes are mostly offset by merit, staff insurance and added staff as well as deferred comp. Outside of salaries and

benefits, we expect higher advertising due to seasonality, outside processing tied to revenue and technology
expense to be mostly offset by lower operating losses.
We expect the tax rate to be 22% to 23%, excluding discrete items, and finally, as I indicated on the previous
slide, we are focused in our CET1 target of 10% as we monitor loan growth trends.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. As I said in my opening remarks, many business lines are showing good momentum, with
increases in loans, commitments and pipeline. Our credit culture continues to produce strong results, and our
expense discipline was evident as we continue to invest in products and services and make progress on our
ongoing digital journey.
The nature of our business results in the balance sheet structure that quickly produces benefits from rising rates.
In the current rate environment, we expect to continue to appropriately grow our securities and swap portfolios
with a goal of providing more consistent earnings performance through the cycles. Our unique expertise in many
areas as well as our geographic footprint offers significant growth opportunities. I'm honored to work along such a
talented and committed team. We are well-positioned as we move forward in 2022.
Thank you for your time and now, we'd be happy to take questions.

Good morning. Good morning. Curt, you said that you expect fee income to be more robust as we move through
the year. Can you discuss a little bit more on what gives you confidence in that and then maybe just a little bit
more color more broadly on the optimism that you're hearing from your customers and what your sense is that
that optimism is going to be enough to translate into continued loan growth?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Great, yeah, and good morning, Bill. Yeah, there are a couple of factors in play here. First, it's important to
remember that we are always seasonally lower in Q1. It typically gets off to a lower start, fewer days and just
overall a little bit lower seasonal activity. Beyond that, we had the added burden, as I mentioned, of Omicron that
we don't expect to repeat. And, of course, we had significant impact from market-related fees. I think it was about
$32 million just from market impacts on things like CVA, deferred comp, warrant valuation.
So, we had a lot of anomalous things going on in the first quarter. We do expect all those to be removed as we
move through the last three quarters of the year and get the normal seasonal pickup. And you layer that on top of
just some customer cautious optimism and we do think we'll see more activity in noninterest income as the year
goes on. Maybe I'll flip it over to Peter for other comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Bill, I would just add that – to Jim's comment that probably even a little more than cautious optimism, I think
our customer base continues to perform really well. We – we've communicated to you guys that our pipelines are
still above pre-COVID levels, and we're seeing that in really across our footprint and just about every business
line, the outlook is pretty good.
I don't know that I can say that it's as maybe robust as it was middle of last year, but it's still really strong. And,
obviously, there's a number of things going on in the economy that customers are being cautious about or
prepared for, but I don't know that I would say they're pulling back at all. I think they're moving forward and we feel
really good about where we sit and our ability to capture that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful, thank you. And if I may follow up with just one additional question, your peers are assuming
more rate hikes than the 75 basis points that you have in your outlook. Was the objective there just to be
conservative? And that sort of along those lines, on your interest rate sensitivity assumptions on slide 13, it looks
like your asset sensitivity came down a bit. You've talked about reducing some of your asset sensitivity as rates
rise. Is that something that – like this is indicating you've started doing already, or do you expect to wait a bit
before more aggressively lowering your asset sensitivity? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Bill, we very purposefully took down our asset sensitivity to a certain degree this quarter. Certainly,
deposits were a piece of that. I had mentioned at the January earnings call that we did have some seasonal
deposits that were inflating our asset sensitivity, and so that piece was not a surprise. But beyond that, we did
enter into a very significant level of [ph] fixed receive (00:25:17) contracts, $6.3 billion worth of receive contracts
made up of $3.5 billion of off-balance sheet swaps, $2.8 billion of net securities once you account for the
paydowns.
And so that was a pretty significant move, it brings a lot of those rate hikes forward. We are essentially taking 250
basis points worth of receive fixed instruments, making that a certainty by pulling it forward into the run rate for the
time value of money. And then in exchange for that, we did give up about $23 million of asset sensitivity. Most of
the rest of that was deposits.

So it has been a goal of ours to stabilize our net interest income, take advantage of higher rates as they increase.
And that's exactly what we're doing. We feel really good about the progress we made this quarter and we
continue to – we expect to continue to do that as the quarters go on throughout the year.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Just one follow-up on that last question on hedging, Jim. What is the longer-term goal or philosophy of the
hedging? What are you really trying to accomplish there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
The ultimate goal is to smooth out our net interest income and asset sensitivity. We don't like the feast or famine
cycle that America had been in for really a number of cycles. So our goal is to take advantage of the higher rates
as they exist today, to lock those in so that we're protected from a risk standpoint when rates drop.
And the good news is we're always going to leave a little bit of asset sensitivity on the table. So the goal is to
protect ourselves from a drop in rates, take advantage of the rates that we see out there today, lock them in, bring
them forward, and still leave a little bit of asset sensitivity on the table. We will likely have asset sensitivity in the
low-single-digit percentage area so I think we're always going to benefit from rates rising.
But it's important to us to lock in opportunistic rates like we're seeing today and take advantage of putting those
really in the income stream for the next several years. So it's a very balanced approach and we will do this
gradually over the next several quarters, certainly made a lot of progress this quarter and expect to make a lot of
progress over the next several quarters.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Okay. Good, thank you on that. And then on the deposit beta question, I – last quarter, you were asked a little bit
about the likelihood of being closer to 10% versus 30%, your standard model. Have you seen anything in terms of
deposit pricing pressure or requests from your clients after this first hike? And just curious on your thinking that
we could be closer to 10% deposit beta, at least early on, than the 30% standard model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, I'm going to offer some general comments then maybe I'll flip it to Peter for some customer color on that.
We still feel, with all the liquidity in the economy, that the first several hikes will be below 10%, we'll get closer to
the 10% as the subsequent hikes happen. But we still feel pretty good about following the pattern of the last cycle.
The Fed has gotten more hawkish since we talked in January on the earnings call, so there's probably a little bit
more pressure on that beta than I might have thought. But it doesn't take us above 10% for the first few so we still
feel pretty good about a manageable beta in the short- to-medium term. But in terms of color from the customer
side, I'll flip it to Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Jon, and I think the other thing I would say is like everything that we do, it's very much relationship-focused.
And so far, that hasn't been a major point of conversation. I suspect as we get further into the year, it will be. Your
– in your larger businesses that are moving bigger deposits, there might be a little more sensitivity to it just
because of their access to other rates across the country.
But so far, it hasn't been something that we've really faced as a big challenge, but we're prepared to talk about it
and we know that it'll be something, as the year goes on, we'll need to be upfront with our customers on.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Morning. Appreciate all the guidance detail, particularly around the fee trends and NII. I guess putting it all
together, how should we think about the level of total revenue growth expectation for 2022? I know you gave
some detail around NII of around up 13%. There's a lot of puts and takes there, particularly on the fee side as we
11


Comerica, Inc.

were talking about. So is it reasonable to assume perhaps a 5% to 6% revenue growth expectation for the year,
or could it be better than that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, John, number one, starting with net interest income, and maybe I'll circle back to part of Bill's question that
I'm not sure I answered fully, we did offer some guidance, we assumed the 25 bps from March in our guidance,
we assumed the 50 bps in May. And I think the question Bill had was are we being conservative, do we not think
those future rate hikes are going to happen? That is absolutely not the case.
The rationale for our guidance being set the way it was is there is a wide range of opinions out there in terms of
where Fed hikes were going to go. I think even amongst the estimates on the sell-side analysts side there's a
wide range of estimates. So rather than try to pick one, we thought it would be more hopeful to give the hikes that
we know are happening for certain and then give you the model, and you have the $160 million for average 50 bp
hike or [ph] a point to point hundred (00:31:42). You have the model for that that you can plug in, you can apply
the sensitivities that we have on the deposit betas that are on the slide.
So it's a little bit of a plug and play. So we're trying to be helpful there in terms of giving you the certainty aspect of
the beta hike and then you can put in as many hikes as you want and prorate it by that model that we provided. In
terms of revenue growth for the year, I would bifurcate it between what's going to happen with net interest income,
and again there's a wide range of outcomes there in terms of Fed hikes, as well as what we might add on in terms
of additional swaps and securities.
So just some tremendous upside there. We know that noninterest income is going to be lower than 2021. We tried
to make that as clear as possible. If you look at some of the anomalous income we had in 2021 which I think is in
the earnings materials, whether it be stimulus-related card fees, CVA and the derivative portfolio, warrants, we
have about $70 million of anomalous income that occurred in 2021 that will not occur in 2022.
So we will have a negative percentage for 2022 relative to the noninterest income that's not new news at all, I
think we've been real clear on that. Noninterest income though has some tremendous capacity to create a very
significant growth rate. So just apply the modeling that we provided, add as many swaps and securities as you
think might make sense, we're certainly going to keep up a pace somewhat similar to what we had in the second
or the – in the first quarter, we feel really good about revenue growth in 2022, but there's going to be a range of
outcomes there depending on how many hikes you have.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right, thanks for that. I guess another way to – that I can maybe – can go about asking is I guess also,
wanted to get your thoughts on the magnitude of positive operating leverage that you think you can achieve for
2022 given your low-single-digit growth and expense expectation. So fair to assume that you can achieve possibly
200 to 300 basis points of positive operating leverage, or if you can help us think about that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I would probably go back to the previous answer, again, a wide range of outcomes depending on hikes, but
it's going to be a substantially favorable number. So, again, we feel really good about it and it just depends how
the interest rate environment goes throughout the year.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. No, I've got it. Thank you for that. And one very quick last one, I know you mentioned the floor plan portfolio
increased from $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion I think on average. Just your expectation, you think you can continue to
see modest increases from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
John, it's Peter. I think the short answer to that is probably yes but very modest. I mean we're not expecting a
huge recovery in floor plan. We do feel like – you're starting to see car assembly pick up, you're starting to see
some progress I think in the auto supply chain, but I don't think that's going to translate floor plan balances just
because the demand for cars is still so high. And what we hear from our customers is they're pretty much sold the
moment they're rolled off the truck and I think that's probably going to continue through the, for sure, the rest of
this year, maybe through the rest of next year quite candidly on some of the things that we're hearing.
So we think we'll see a little bit. If you look at a lot of the balanced growth that we saw, it was mostly financing real
estate, we're financing some M&A activity because our customers are going to be on the winning side, if you will,
of buying other dealerships. And so that's what we're really staying focused right now.

Yeah, good morning. I guess just the first question around line utilization, was wondering if you can elaborate why
we didn't see a pickup. We've heard from some of your peers who's observed a pickup or – during the quarter
driven by capital markets being tighter, demand picking up, CapEx, et cetera. Would love any sort of thoughts
around what you think needs to happen to see a meaningful pickup in line utilization from here, and then just the
outlook on the Mortgage Banker businesses then.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Yeah, Ebrahim, it's Peter. I think a little bit of it's portfolio mix. Our overall corporate line utilization, as we
communicated, was about flat. But when you look at sort of our general Middle Market and our general
businesses, Business Banking, US Banking and so forth, we did see a good increase there quarter-over-quarter.
So, we're starting to see some utilization. I wouldn't say it's back to historic levels but we did see a little bit of
utilization.
So, I think the difference you might be seeing there is mostly portfolio mix. It's a good segue to your question on
Mortgage. Mortgage saw a big drop in utilization in the quarter and I think our outlook there is still positive. There's
not anything per se that isn't normal seasonality that we've seen and we still feel really good about the Mortgage
business. And I think as the year unfolds, you'll continue to see – I've tried to communicate to you all that on – if
you look at that quarterly chart in the Appendix, it's up into the right over a long period of time.
And we're focused on adding new customers and increasing that overall warehouse lines that we have out, and
we think we'll be able to continue to do that. So our – we do think though year-over-year, you'll – we will be down,
as we've communicated, in Mortgage Banker.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And do you also expect the Mortgage Banker spreads to narrow as well? So even though it's a LIBOR-based
book, given the market backdrop, you see spreads coming down so that's going to impact how that reprices?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Ebrahim, I think you're asking me about pricing in Mortgage in general and I guess my answer to that question is,
is we do think it's getting – it's more competitive in Mortgage Banker than it was kind of right when the pandemic
started, so there's probably a little bit of pricing pressure there, but nothing that we're not used to in all of our
businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one quick [indiscernible] (00:38:02), sorry for going back to this, I understand there are like wide
options [indiscernible] (00:38:07), but do you have a number in terms of what NII would look like if you just
assume that the forward curve plays out as expected and where NII will – would land in that backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Ebrahim, yeah, we have played with a number of scenarios, but at this point, again, there are so many potential
permeations that I think for now we're going to hold to the 75 bp guidance that we've offered and just offer the
model and let people plug that in.

Good morning, guys. Thanks for – hey, just wanted to ask a question on deposit balances. Is your feeling – I
know you expect modest declines through the remainder of the year vis-à-vis the first quarter, but will the first
quarter have been sort of the worst of the deposit contraction in your view?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Oh, it absolutely will be the worst, Scott. We had a lot of seasonality that occurred as we mentioned. Some of
those structural things, cyclical things related to Fed movements has not really kicked in yet and that will pressure
us probably – with our business model and our heavy dependence on commercial deposits, we will be impacted
probably a little bit more than other banks. But we don't expect for any one quarter that impact to be nearly as
impactful as the seasonal runoff that we saw in the first quarter.

R. Scott Siefers Q

Yeah. Yes, understood, thank you. And then, maybe a follow-up just regarding rate sensitivity. Can you speak
qualitatively to your preference for adding securities versus swaps in moderating your rate sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, we always look at relative value between the two. That's certainly a factor. We also look at capital
implications. Some securities come with capital you need to hold against them. So, that's a factor and that factors
into the overall pricing comparison and relative value between the two of them.
And then, of course, liquidity levels, our cash levels are coming down and that will probably make us a little more
cautious about adding securities going forward. So, we have been adding an abundant amount of both over the
last couple quarters and certainly we stepped it up a lot in the first quarter.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
I do think as the quarters go on, you'll see fewer and fewer securities added and more and more swaps in terms
of the proportion. But they both have their advantages on a relative value basis, one can look better than the other
at times. And so, we'll utilize both going forward, but I think you'll see us continue to pivot a little bit more towards
off-balance sheet swaps as opposed to on-balance sheet securities.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Morning. I wanted to start on the rate sensitivity. I know you've been very clear you have a goal to reduce asset
sensitivity, but what's the thought on adding all the swaps here? Why not wait until rates go up before trimming
the asset sensitivity, because it just feels like you're leaving a lot of economic benefit on the table by doing so
much right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Steve. Yeah, we do not want to pick our point where we think rates are going to peak. We
saw a little bit of that in the last cycle and that's not something we're interested in doing again. I think it's really
important to mention that we are just getting started. We have a lot of swaps, a lot of interest sensitivity still on the
table. We will be taking advantage of these rates over the next several quarters.
We have quite a ways to go. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about it in terms of we put our stake in the sand in
the first quarter of 2022. That's by no means the case. We are going to try to avoid picking where we think rates
are going to peak. We're going to stay methodical, as I've said in the past, and we have a long ways to go.
16


Comerica, Inc.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
And by the way, even when we're done, we're going to leave some asset sensitivity on the table and will still
benefit from higher rates. So we'd like to have our cake and eat it too to a certain extent, we're adding significant
amounts of income to the run rate now, but we have a lot further to go in terms of adding swaps. And as rates go
up, if we're fortunate enough that they do go up continuously over the next year, we will certainly be in a position
to take advantage of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, I might just add a little color, this is Curt, a little color commentary and sort of our thinking here. So, we live
through close to an 8 or 10-year cycle of near zero interest rates beginning with the financial crisis, which was
really challenging for us on the revenue side of the house. And so, when we saw rates increasing in 2017 and
2018, we were a little bit more probably focused on picking a higher point in terms of where the rate cycle might
go. And we made some progress on hedging, but not nearly enough and we saw the dramatic decrease in rates
going to zero as the COVID crisis began.
So, we lived through one of those cycles and we're just trying to be prudent. There's going to be no change to our
model. We are primarily a commercial bank. So, no matter what, as we add more loans and customer
relationships, we're always going to be asset-sensitive as an organization and probably highly asset-sensitive
relative to some in our peer group. But we want to make sure we're dollar cost averaging here if you think about
your stock portfolio and that we're adding appropriately hedges to the portfolio throughout the cycle.
We're all assuming continued rate increases, but we also weren't assuming COVID, we weren't assuming a
Ukrainian war. There's a lot that, no matter what, could derail a scenario. And so, we're just trying to be prudent
and sort of solidifying our revenue stream on a go-forward basis, not just for a short-term cycle, but over several
years going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. And I might add to that, there are really two components of leveling out the asset sensitivity. There's a risk
control aspect and there's a profit maximization aspect. And, Steve, I think you're thinking of the profit
maximization aspect as many equity analysts would. There is a risk control stamp or aspect to this and that we
want to make sure that if things do go south, that we can be as confident as we can be in protecting that common
dividend, which was not a sure thing back when rates were zero and we were having credit pressures. We want
to make sure that, from a credit rating agency standpoint, we're always in good stead. With the customer base we
have, we think our credit rating is extremely important. Our customers value that.
So, I feel like a lot of the wood that we've chopped so far is really taking care of that risk control aspect that to
some extent we've secured the dividend. We've done those things to make sure that we can withstand a
downturn if rates were to go the other direction. And as rates continue to go higher, I think we'd start transitioning
from the risk control aspect to more of the profit maximization. So, really a couple objectives there that we're
trying to check the box on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's very helpful color actually. So, for Curt, in your prepared comments, when you talk about
modernization efforts and you indicated a greater sense of urgency, is the message to the market that there could
17


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
be more spin coming from the company at some point or are you simply saying that you recognize that to be
competitive and improve the client experience you need to take modernization to the next level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, it's a little bit of both. I just think over the last 24 months, the whole world, the whole corporate America has
learned a lot. And I really think, as a CEO of a company, whether you're a bank or a nonbank, you've got to be
thinking about sort of the operating model in a post-COVID world.
And so, the way I think you should think about this is that it's really a continuation of a path that we've been on for
some time. And we're finding ways to accelerate our progress in terms of our retail branch delivery and sort of the
customer experience there, continued investment in digital and in our real estate footprint. And I can go into detail
on all of those, but on the retail side, we've been a very good steward of, over time, trimming our network there.
We operate a fairly thin branch franchise today. But we think we've got some opportunities to continue to look
selectively at locations. And those would sort of bleed out over future quarters as we have opportunities there.
And we're just looking at sort of our model around branch delivery to make sure it's as efficient as it possibly can
be with really the goal of always doing a good job of the customer experience, but also enabling our colleagues
with digital delivery, etcetera.
And on the real estate side, we've done a very good job there. We've reduced our real estate footprint in the last –
really since 2015 about 20% to 25%. But with all these flexible work arrangements being more accommodative to
the new world of balancing work from home and work from the office, we think there's opportunities there to
continue to rationalize some of our real estate, but also create space that we think is very attractive to our
employees and accommodate some more collaborative sort of open floor plan. And technology is an ongoing
journey. A lot of the savings that we realized through those two initiatives, which are sort of heavy real estate
focused, we're going to continue to invest in digital.
The reason we're pointing this out to you is we did have some charges in the quarter that we called out. They
were fairly modest. We anticipate, as we think about these things, we haven't yet decided all of them, that we may
in subsequent quarters have some additional charges. And I'm going to let Jim add some additional color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think of this in a couple aspects. We're going to have what I call some exit and transitional charges of
which you saw $6 million in the first quarter and you'll see some additional charges in subsequent quarters. Some
will be smaller than the $6 million, some will larger. Those would not be in our outlook since they're not even
formed yet. But I do think of those as exit and transitional charges. We talked about asset impairments and
severance in this most recent $6 million. To the extent we actually have investment in our applications, in our core
product suite, those are not the types of things that I think is something we would call out. We try to self-fund
those as much as we can. I think about those in terms of our normal investment portfolio that we do each year on
the technology side as well as just any normal evergreening of facilities and banking centers.
And so, we'll manage it really from two aspects and we'll probably report it as such. We certainly will call out the
exit and transitional cost that occur, but we will attempt to self-fund many of the investments in this on the pure
product side as we can. But more to come and of course these are still forming.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hi. Thanks. Hi. Good morning, all. I want to go back to page 13 in the deck and the projected swap benefit as of
3/1/2022. So, can you just help us understand like is that marked at a certain LIBOR rate and then that'll change
as LIBOR goes up that slide, or are you just locked in knowing that that chart and the expected contribution is
sticky and will carry with you through this period that you show on the lower-right chart? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Ken. Yeah, those benefits are based on LIBOR rates and BSBY rates as of the end of
March. And so, to the extent you get a rise in those rates, you will bring in less income or recognize less income
on the swaps. Of course, you more than make that up many times over on the loan side. And the impact of both
of those are already forwarded into the modeling that we have on the bottom-left side of that page. So, it is all
accounted for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

... the 60-day plus, as well as the 30-day. The vast majority of our focus is still on LIBOR because we didn't start
making BSBY and SOFR loans until January 1. So, we started really the momentum right as the year was ending
in 2021. But at this point, the vast majority is still LIBOR. We do turn our book over every two years to three years,
so you can kind of prorate that to get a feel for the rate at which BSBY and SOFR would start to replace the
LIBOR loans.

Got it. Yes, forgot about that chart. Thank you for the reminder. And then last one just on the – your comments
about your belief that a low beta, you said 10%-ish or so for the first couple hikes. What's your line of sight on how
long the betas could stay that low? And how do you look at that just in – is that in the second quarter guidance?
How far out do you have a line of sight on the beta staying that low? Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken, I'd mentioned that in the first few hikes of the last cycle, it was really the first five, we stayed below a
10% beta for each of those. And so, that's still our kind of base case at this point, that we will stay below 10% for
the first five. And the guidance that we offered in the outlook, that takes that into account. That does have a
somewhat moderate beta in it. So, that is accounted for.

Good morning. Question on asset quality. It remains excellent. You had another negative provision in the quarter.
How much longer can we see negative provisions in this environment where it's a bit more uncertain as rates are
going up so fast and we have obviously more geopolitical risk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Jennifer. This is Melinda. It's really difficult to predict under the CECL methodology exactly what's
going to happen with provision. But suffice it to say, as was already mentioned, I mean, we feel really good about
the underlying quality of the portfolio, assuming that the economic environment stays relatively positive and
stable. You know it is possible, given that CECL is still new, we don't really know where the bottom is. It is
possible that we could have very modest levels of provision, negative provision, and then stabilizing. We expect
charge-offs, as Jim and Curt mentioned, to sort of stabilize to the low end of our normal range. Although asset
quality again is excellent right now, it is not sustainable in the long run. I mean, we are a commercial bank. We
20

lend money and customers have challenges. And there's a lot of economic uncertainty right now just given all the
inflationary pressure.
So, we saw just a little bit of migration in the first quarter in terms of our criticized assets, nothing that would lead
us to be concerned about any particular portfolio. But we continue to watch those portfolios that are more
sensitive to just the general economic challenges. So, possible to have a negative provision, small negative
provision, for a couple of quarters, but very, very difficult to predict specifically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Which portfolios do you feel are most vulnerable with the rising rate environment at Comerica?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Certainly our leverage portfolio. I mean, obviously, given the amount of leverage that they have, they are very
sensitive to interest rate increases. We do sensitize that portfolio when we underwrite initially. And again, our
leverage portfolio is really part of our Middle Market, kind of core C&I relationship strategy. So, we underwrite
strong companies and management teams and have a lot of confidence that they'll be able to manage through
that. But that book is kind of the tip of the spear for credit quality concerns, and we continue to watch that one
closely.
Automotive, the supplier base, has obviously been challenged given the chip shortage plus you add on to that all
the other uncertainty around the inflationary pressures. But it's a relatively small book compared to the total. And
we have many, many decades of experience in that automotive supplier base, and they have managed through
many, many cycles successfully. So, those are the two portfolios I'd say that we are watching most closely.
And then small business, obviously they have less pricing capability in terms of just all the inflationary pressures,
less ability to pass that on. So, that book has held up incredibly well. It has good liquidity, but we have less
visibility into a small customer versus some of our larger customers. So, we're watching that one as well.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Thanks. Good morning, Curt. I was just curious about if there are any plans to manage the available for sale
securities portfolio in a rising rate environment? And any thoughts on maybe moving it to held to maturity or
hedging it especially as soon as I think, Jim, you said that you hold the available for sale to maturity anyway?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Peter. Yeah, we have absolutely no plans to move any of that to HTM and really we
discount the entire AOCI discussion. I know it does have an impact on tangible book, book value per share. I
know that's a bit of an optic. But I think when you look through the true economics, which I think everyone should,
if you look at other parts of our balance sheet that are not marked, in particular deposits as I mentioned, we
benefit so much economically from an economic value of the franchise, from rising rates that we are not
concerned about a single line item being marked down and what that does to tangible book. We think the real
economic value needs to be looked at and we think it's just a bit of window dressing to put it in the hold to
maturity, so certainly no plans there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just on Energy, it's under, I guess, 3% of the loans now. Is there an interest in growing this
portfolio, just like I'd feel like underwriting standards are much stronger, loan spreads are better just due to less
competition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, this is Peter. I think the – we are focused on continuing to be an energy bank. We feel really good about
our Energy portfolio that we have today. I don't know that we're going to return to the levels that you saw five
years or six years ago as far as the percentage of the portfolio. We did see a little increase this quarter, but not a
lot.
So, it's a business that we've been in for a long, long time. We plan to stay in it, but I don't think it'll get to the size
that it was, like I said, probably five years or six years ago. We feel real good about the level that we're at and
plan to maintain that.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to revisit the size of the balance sheet for a moment, combining the comments
you made on the tempering of the securities growth, the cash normalization process, and deposit growth. Just
taking a step back, how do we think about near-term earning assets relative to the $83 million, [ph] $83.5 million
(00:59:13) this quarter? How do we think about the cadence of that in the next couple quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Chris. We do think that, to some extent, we will see temp investments go down and loans
will eat in to some of that. But the bottom line is deposits are also going to decrease, and that will probably be
what really moves the balance sheet. So, we will see a very modest reduction in earning assets to the extent
deposits go down that shrinks the overall size of the balance sheet. But there'll be some moving parts there
definitely go in both directions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But just to reiterate, the drop that we saw this quarter, we're talking much more manageable declines in
earning assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Much more manageable, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then from there later in the year is there a – as you kind of look to next year, would you expect
this trend to reverse as deposit growth resets with the Fed doing in that regard?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
You know, the Fed is going to stay active probably for a couple years. We don't expect their balance sheet to
return to the level the Fed's likely to target until about 2024. Rate increases will probably go through at least part
of 2023. And of course sometimes customers react on a bit of a lag. So, I think you'll see deposits kind of languish
just slightly down from where they're at now probably over the next couple years is our best guess. But there's no
exact equation for this. There are so many moving parts in the economy with money supply that it's hard to say.
But certainly, the Fed actions will cast a shadow over deposit growth, and those will continue over the next couple
years most likely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then if I could just squeeze one more. The buyback is seemingly reaching the end as you've
achieved your capital target. Is there anything to speak of in terms of inorganic capital use, M&A?

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. No new information there, Chris. We continue to be very focused on organic growth and are having a lot of
good success both in our legacy franchise but also in examples like our expansion into the Southeast, into North
Carolina as we set up commercial loan offices there and have now added wealth management capabilities. We
envision eventually adding a retail bank there as well down the road. We've added some staff in our Denver office
as well in the Middle Market side.
And so, we've got really good opportunities in our existing franchise still in some of the best markets in the United
States in terms of major metro markets especially in Texas and California, then Michigan is doing well also. And
then, we've been able to parlay that into expansion into other markets as well.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on the ACL question. I'm just wondering, as you work through the
first quarter and your CECL model, have you made any active changes to your probability weightings in terms of
kind of recession risks, GDP growth, etcetera, and any detail you could provide on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Gary, this is Melinda. The economic forecast that we selected in the first quarter was relatively consistent
with the economic forecast in the fourth quarter. And the way we approach that economic uncertainty is to look at
certain portfolios and then stress them to a higher recessionary scenario, which we did. And so, we used a more
severe recessionary forecast for a portion of the portfolio to add to the qualitative reserves to come up with, again,
that kind of small release number that we had this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you for that. And just one more follow-up just on AOCI question that Peter had asked, that your point
is well taken in terms of it being kind of a timing issue and temporary. But in terms of – we've still seen obviously
the value of the curve, rates move higher here over the first month of the second quarter. Can you give any color
in terms of the sensitivity of AOCI to additional moves from here? Obviously, the base that they're moving up from
is higher than it was from yearend in 2021.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Gary, in our modeling, it's not a lot different from what we've seen. We saw kind of that medium part of the
curve where securities were – move about 100 bps over the last couple quarters and we took that close to $1
billion hit to AOCI. It's about the same sensitivity. So, 100 bps would generate about $1 billion of hit or $250
million for every 25 bp and it's somewhat linear. So, kind of in that ballpark.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. I definitely appreciate the comments that everyone is making different assumptions on rates and you guys
don't want to be creating point estimates. But just coming back to your plug-and-play comment, I mean if I'm
trying to work that to what it seems like the central case of the market that maybe the Fed has to go to 3% or
3.5% this year, I mean is the plug and play as simple as your guidance implies $2.1 billion of NII this year?
There's no rate benefit really in the first quarter. So, that's more like $2.2 billion on a run rate.
And then, if I throw in $310 million, that gets me close to 3% on Fed funds and maybe throw in a little bit more
than that if the Fed goes to 3.25% or 3.50%. So, it's like if I'm working back to that central case of the market, of
the fixed income market at least of a 3% to 3.5% Fed funds rate is like a $2.5 billion NII at least using your plug
and play correctly or I guess it's hard for you to bless that, I guess, but maybe it's like the Fed, you can issue a
non-objection to make sure [indiscernible] (01:05:55).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. The model is pretty linear and it's not going to change a lot as rates continue to move higher. From an
exact modeling standpoint, I just remind you, as I mentioned in the script, that most of our floating rate loans reset
at the end of the month following a rate hike. So, you'd want to get that right in terms of your quarterly impact
assumptions. But it is pretty linear along the lines of what you're describing and what the graph shows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
And then, the added challenge is, again, if I believe the fixed income market, I'm supposed to be maybe modeling
some cuts in 2024. So, I think you said by the time this process is done, you'd like asset sensitivity to be in the
low-single-digit range. So, is the just logical implication that next time around, if and when the Fed cuts, we're
talking like $100 million adjustment to NII not like the much bigger numbers we would have seen historically?

That is exactly the goal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then, maybe if I could squeeze in the last one, I mean just trying to translate all this to like a
normalized earnings power. If you want to just give me normalized EPS, that would be great. But, no, credit is the
other big swing factor. Can you just remind us – what do you think is a reasonable either point estimate for
charge-offs or a range? I know it's tricky because you're always – commercial books are rarely at normalized
charge-offs. They're either – they're on trough for a long time and then they're briefly at a peak. But as you think
about through the cycle credit costs, what kind of range of charge-offs do you plug in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Melinda. I think as Curt or Jim already mentioned, I mean we do expect these extremely low levels
of charge-offs to continue to normalize. And we would guide towards the low end of our kind of normal range of
20 basis points to 40 basis points would be what we would expect.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just want to ask a little further on balance sheet position here with higher rates. Obviously, a
pretty big markdown on the securities book. Just kind of curious, is there an AOCI mark that could cause you to
stop securities purchases? And then the other part here just kind of thinking about what is the percentage of cash
to assets maybe just thinking of it as a ratio that you guys want to hold going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
All right. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. Yeah, to your first question, we are not concerned about
the AOCI impact. So, there is no level that would cause us to not buy securities or do something different. We're
very focused on the economics just as we think everybody else should be.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Just I think you said you're going to focus more on probably more swaps, less securities going forward. Just kind
of curious what's the percentage of cash you seek to hold? Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Oh, the cash, yeah. Yeah. We've always targeted because we do have a commercial base that's a little bit lumpy
and we can see some larger ins and outs out of our cash position perhaps relative to some pure banks. We
typically like to hold $3 billion to $4 billion worth of cash used to be our own benchmark. First of all, look at the
changes in the environment as we come into the next cycle. And the options were tapped into funding on a very
expedient basis, sometimes we'll move that number up or down, just depending on our access to funding. But
kind of in that $3 billion, maybe $3 billion to $4 billion range is kind of the level of cash we like to hold.

Hey. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to hit on the Technology and Life Science
business. It looks like the average loans hit an inflection point this quarter, so I just wanted to get the outlook
there. And then on the equity fund services, obviously good Q-on-Q growth and the outlook I think for the venture
capital association is still pretty robust. So, just any sort of color there on outlook would be great. Thanks.

add resources to. The TLS business is one that, you're right, it did feel like it hit an inflection point maybe this
quarter. And we're seeing really good volume there and feel like we've got an opportunity to continue to grow that.
On the [ph] EFS (01:10:40) side, I would say the same thing. Both of those businesses, the outlook feels really
good and the pipeline activity is really good. And across the country, we're finding opportunities to add people or

pick up people. It is extremely competitive in the TLS business I would tell you. A number of banks I think are

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Curt. Good morning, Jim. Jim, maybe just a couple of follow-ups on the asset sensitivity on
the back of Ken and Brian's question. So, on slide 13 can you maybe just talk about what the received rate was
on the swaps that you added? And, Jim, maybe more just philosophically, can you maybe just talk about what
you're looking at to trigger additions to the swaps? Is there a minimum received fix level that you're looking at
based on your view of the rate environment? Is there a set notional amount we should expect you to be adding on
a quarterly basis to reduce the sensitivity? I'm just trying to think about mechanically how you're going to do this
given that I think, on our math, you need to add another $25 billion to $30 billion of swaps. I'm just curious on the
received rate and how you think about adding over the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Ryan. The ones we added in the first quarter, the gross received rate was just a tad over 2%,
very close to 2%. And of course, we paid BSBY, which is actually running below LIBOR at this point. So, that
would be – give you a perspective for the rates. In terms of the volume, I would go back to my more global
comments that we're looking at this holistically in terms of what are the securities options on the balance sheet,
what are the swap options off the balance sheet. And as I mentioned, we will likely sort of pivoting more towards
the swaps. If you look at what we did with securities and swaps in the first quarter at $6.3 billion on a net basis,
and that's a pretty step-up pace. I don't know if we'll run quite at that pace every quarter. It will depend on market
conditions. But we'll certainly be running close to that for the next couple of quarters, and you will see more of a
pivot towards swaps I suspect over the next couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just on your follow-up for the modest decline in deposits, just given the pace of rate hikes that
we're expecting over the next couple of quarters, how are you thinking about the mix of deposits? You're currently
28


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
in the mid-50s on noninterest bearing, and I think last cycle as we got to 150 basis points or so, we started to see
deposits look for a little bit more rate on what they were receiving. So, I'm just curious, what are you assuming for
mix shift over the course of the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think to the extent we lose deposits, it will be disproportionately to noninterest bearing. I think even
beyond that, we will likely see a modest shift. Each rate hike from noninterest bearing to interest bearing, that's
just natural. We saw it go the other direction. As rates were going down, customers just became less rate-
sensitive. So, we will see a gradual remix of that portfolio towards interest-bearing over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Having just said that – that just having said that our portfolio is so heavy on the commercial banking side in our
deposit mix and so much of that is operating funds for businesses and companies that we work with. We're
always going to have a high noninterest-bearing component probably relative to our peer group even though we
see some mix shift occurring.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. That's actually part of the value of the business model here at Comerica, having treasury
management services and they're certainly a foundational piece in terms of operational deposits.
