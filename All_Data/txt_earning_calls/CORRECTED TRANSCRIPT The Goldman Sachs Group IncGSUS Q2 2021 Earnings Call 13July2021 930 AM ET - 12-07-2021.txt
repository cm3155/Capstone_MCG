Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Carey and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. I will begin on page 1 of the presentation with
a review of our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second
highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we
delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02. Second quarter results
contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion which drove
year-to-date ROE of 27.3%, and ROTE of 28.9%.
Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise, and the constructive but more normalized
market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm's strategic
priorities across all four of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day.
In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed
certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerged from the pandemic, the drive for
scale, the push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set. We
have maintained a number one rank in completed M&A for 19 of the last 20 years and have been the leader in
equity underwriting for 9 of the last 10 years. We're broadening our transaction banking platform. In June, we

launched in the UK, and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early
in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive.
We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We
continued to deploy balance sheet to support client activity, and we are further expanding our means of
engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms.
A good example is our Marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio
analytics for our institutional clients versus via APIs.
In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by
delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset
classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds where we have raised $74 billion in
gross commitments across the range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day.
Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China's largest
bank. The JV will combine our expertise in asset management with ICBC's extensive access to retail and
institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our longstanding relationship with ICBC and represents a
significant opportunity for us to grow internationally.
In Consumer & Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM from new and existing clients and
ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating the
leading digital consumer banking platform where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues
to be very high. This quarter, we launched Apple Card Family, which allows co-owners on the same account to
build credit together as equals.
In addition, as we grow markets, invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building
a more comprehensive consumer banking offering. All-in, the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with
our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and the increasing durability of
our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our board of directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend
to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by
150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won't necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to
prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy.
With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on page 2. It's clear that we're in the middle of a
significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the US and China, driven by the lifting of
health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement
has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and, in the United States, the prospect of
further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending. A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the
prospect of the US economy overheating, but recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the
central bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be
transitory and that any resulting risks could be adequately managed.
From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The Delta variant, should it spread
further, could steer policy actions that slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like
Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe. While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not
consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution

and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government
officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts.
At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in
the United States, Hong Kong and India, among other locations, building on the support we are providing
communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic. More broadly, as risk
managers, we closely monitor developments and remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the
challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity,
are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an
ever-changing market backdrop.
As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking
backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of
elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may
prove more volatile as supplemental benefits expire in the US, corporate clients remain steadfast in their efforts to
emerge stronger from the pandemic. In our Markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market
share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative
to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving
demand from both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform.
Before I turn it over to Stephen, I'd like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are
an incredibly dedicated and resilient team and I'm so proud of how we've worked tirelessly to serve our clients
amid the challenges of the last 18 months. Again and again, I've heard from our clients that they say Goldman
Sachs is ahead of the curve and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever.
Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City,
Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer. With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a
regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We
recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic, and we'll continue to provide
our colleagues with the support they need.
Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which
we operate. I've heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the
office and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We have always given our people the flexibility they need to
manage their professional and personal lives and we will continue to do so.
That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bonds that support a culture of collaboration has
renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive. I'm
particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in-person
working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs.
I'll close by saying I'm very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders.
I'm especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop. Importantly,
we are making progress in executing our strategy and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment, beginning on page 4.
Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial advisory
revenues of $1.3 billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and the increasing market
position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint.
We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $975 billion of
announced transactions with a volume market share of 33%. Activity continues to be strong across geographies,
particularly in the Americas with strength across all industry groups reflecting the breadth of our franchise.
Underwriting performance remain very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues following on from a
record performance in the first quarter. Equity underwriting performance, in particular, continued to be strong,
generating $1.2 billion in revenues amid elevated IPO activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with
revenues of over $1 billion. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with
volumes in the first half climbing to $85 billion across 400 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%, up
40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date, more than all of last
year.
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $950 million, with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes
and importantly, robust acquisition financing activity, including LBOs as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor
activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our financing and advisory businesses, as well as our
dominant share in financial sponsor activity. Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in
Europe, with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to
continue in future quarters.
Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our Investment
Banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A
activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions.
Corporate lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from transaction banking and middle market and
relationship lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the
relationship loan book. Transaction banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients,
generating roughly $40 billion in deposits, with an increasing percentage becoming operational.
Moving to Global Markets on page 5, segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter, driven by solid client
activity and a generally supportive market-making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across
both FICC and equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced
significant dislocation and volatility, driving elevated client volumes. We remain focused on building upon recent
market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment.
Beginning with FICC on page 6, second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was
impacted by spread compression amid lower volatility, though activity remained high with a number of
macroeconomic crosscurrents around economic recovery and inflation. In commodities, we saw solid
performance across our increasingly diversified business, with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, ags
and metals, and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
In mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower
results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan
origination and financing. Across both, credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread
compression, led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters, though market share gains helped
offset the effects of a relatively subdued trade environment. FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven
by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance.
Moving to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, as we actively deployed our balance
sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion,
with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives.
In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low-touch channels. And in derivatives, we saw solid
performance in EMEA, following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger
results in structured products across geographies.
Equities financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business.
Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and
new clients. While growth in Equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very
disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement.
Moving to Asset Management on page 7, in the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion.
Management and other fees totaled $727 million which rose year-on-year despite approximately $160 million of
fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with
industry practice in this rate environment.
Incentive fees for the quarter were $78 million. Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion amid
a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly one-third of these revenues. The
growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is
focused exclusively on investments in growth stage technology-driven companies, spanning multiple industries.
Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly
$900 million, driven by market appreciation on investments, including Privia Health, KnowBe4 and Flywire. We
will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit.
Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than
two-thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings,
capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in
Oncoclínicas, a Brazilian oncology business, Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a
messaging software firm.
Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment
entities. Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million, driven by NII and
gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and
idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments.
On page 8, we show the composition of our diversified Asset Management balance sheet, consistent with the
information that we have provided to you in prior quarters.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to page 9. We included this page in today's earnings presentation to
provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset
Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of
our business. The message on the page is simple. While the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased
modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and
IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion. These dispositions have been largely offset by markups on the portfolio of
approximately $5 billion given the supportive market backdrop mentioned as well as modest additions to the
balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments.
So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied
capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is
approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset
sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction. As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this
disposition activity particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR.
Moving to page 10, Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second
quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion
as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion. Private banking and lending revenues were $260 million,
with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives. We remain
focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals representing a
significant AUS opportunity.
Consumer banking revenues were $363 million for the quarter, reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card
loans. The low-rate environment as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15
months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this.
Next, let's turn to page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees.
Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven
by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows, and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-
wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion.
On page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII
was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an
increase in interest-earning assets. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our
total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by wealth management and
residential real estate warehouse lending as well as Apple Card. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit
of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop,
partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate
in coming quarters, consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm.
Let's turn to expenses on page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion and our efficiency
ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense
discipline while investing for growth. Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at
34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results, in line with our pay-for-
performance culture.
Non-compensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation costs. Excluding
the impact of litigation, non-compensation was up approximately 6% relative to top line growth of 16%, as
8

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
increases in transaction-based and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to
investment entities.
We remain focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a
recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the
medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm. Our effective
tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be
approximately 21%, and we'll monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the US on the federal and
state level.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital on slide 14. On June 28, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative
stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a common equity tier 1 requirement of
13.4% effective October 1. As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share.
While our expectation of the Federal Reserve's stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our
SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of
our businesses.
In light of our most recent SCB, we recognize that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR
cycle and achieving our target in the medium term by definition will be more challenging.
That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is
appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We prioritize deploying capital
for our client franchise at attractive returns, paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of
earnings, and then returning any excess to shareholders via share purchases.
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1
billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management
philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our
stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total
assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with
our global core liquid assets, averaging $329 billion.
On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter, and our long term
debt also rose by $20 billion, driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance.
Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our Fixed Income call in May, our year-to-date
benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year, contrary to our intention at the start
of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm.
We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring non-bank funding persist albeit
at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half.
Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher
utilization of deposit funding globally. To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank
entities to facilitate more activity in the US Bank, bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm wide balance sheet.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength
of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given
strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium term return targets with a path
to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. A quick follow-up. You noted the record prime brokerage – prime financing balances and
curious if you could drill down a little bit on how much is environment and engagement of clients versus new
clients and market share gains. And while we're on the topic, I'd love to know, if you have any thoughts following
the Archegos incident, what has or do you expect to change in the industry as a result? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks a lot, Glenn. So on prime balances, they have grown. They've grown kind of consistent with the broader
strategy that we set up. As to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients, I would say it's both. I
would say the environment, obviously, by virtue of balances accreting in this market, that has grown balances.
And we've obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients and frankly speaking to be more profound with our
existing ones.
But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there's a clear screen which
looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms both around new entrants and equally around the
back book of our prime balances. And so we're being rather judicious in the context of what we bring in to assure
that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and
clients. And our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way.
On the part of your question relating to Archegos, look, this has obviously gathered kind of an investigative
purview from a number of geographies and across regulators, kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or
what that yields. I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be
supportive of, there will be moves by regulators to achieve that, but very hard to say kind of as to where that all
plays out. As we said in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of
regulatory and industry change that will come about.

Sure.

Analyst, Evercore ISI
...two of the new business builds. You mentioned the family card with Apple. I'm curious on – in what customer
segment you're going after with that? Maybe a bigger question on – do you have any numbers for us in terms of
accounts, balances or new partners you want to talk about? Then maybe that same comment – question for
transaction banking, clients, deposits, just tracking progress. I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say – let's start with Apple Card. The press
around creating the family plan was, frankly speaking, to achieve a greater and more positive user experience so
that people across the family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that
move will accelerate share, but I think more importantly and its objective was to create just a better overall user
experience.
On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of
COVID, we've seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than
we thought. And we've now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth, consistent with
the tone of the consumer market that we're seeing. And I think there's more opportunities to be had with Apple
using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So you'll start to see forward growth, and I
suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increased in – originations and underwriting in Apple Card, and
the family plan will only serve to help that.
In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We're upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion
of deposits, and perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we're starting to see an
acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that's obviously the lynchpin to creating a deposit
base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm. I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that
business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It's turning out that the user interface and
the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we're offering by way of experience and
technology is proving to be the winning ticket.
And so as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to start to see geographic expansion
both to the UK and Japan. We've set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth
with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so I think that business
will continue to play forward. And perhaps what's most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate
franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which
we're able to sell-in through an existing client base.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe just start off with the equity investments portfolio. And thanks very
much for the roll forward on slide 9. I guess, I have a two-parter on that slide. It's a high-class problem, but you
11

sold out nearly $6 billion in positions, and you made basically no progress in reducing the equity investment
portfolio. So curious what else you can do to bring that portfolio down?
And then maybe more broadly, is it time to really rethink the sort of disposition strategy? Your stock is at all-time
high. The market is rewarding your stock for strong revenue growth and ROE expansion, and they don't really
care about capital position. So I mean, should you just – not just cut the buyback, focus on revenue growth rather
than potentially making on economic investment dispositions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So thanks, Christian. We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made
progress on our goals with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing, and I'll let Stephen
highlight some of the details in the moment – at the moment, but we continue to move aggressively to manage
those positions. I think it's a very constructive environment for us to do so, and I think you'll continue to do that –
you'll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions. We
continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more
durable and recurring revenues. And the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we're doing in the Asset
Management business is one aspect of that.
On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decreased our buyback in the
quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business.
And so, if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we'll continue to do it,
but we want to remain, and I think we've always been, a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so when we see
those opportunities, we will make investments, and we'll continue to grow the business. If, for some reason, the
environment changes and we don't, we'll return that capital appropriately to shareholders. Stephen, you want to
comment just on the progress along those sell-downs because we have made real targeted progress, and we'll
continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we've set out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, I guess let's just start kind of with the facts. Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5
billion did come off balance sheet, producing $4 billion of capital relief. And as I mentioned, there's another $3
billion that's in sight to take $1 billion of capital down. Now that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity
portfolio. There's consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on balance sheet, all
of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital. Now why does that matter and why
we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it?
Well, first of all, obviously, we're looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to
influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more
broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm,
which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we've raised since Investor Day $75
billion of new funds in those funds, okay, we'll increase assets under supervision and equally will increase fee
revenue that's being generated by those investments in that fund format.
And so in a way, the page to watch on the forward will be page 11 of our Investor Day presentation because
what's going to play out and we promised more disclosure, which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under
supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and

predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of
businesses. And I think that's the broader picture, if you will, in terms of what we're trying to achieve.
What we put on page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made, much as it would
otherwise be masked by, as you put it, kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market
also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments.

So wanted to start off with a question just on the Investment Banking outlook. First half revenue is a record. You
cited the record backlog. We're clearly seeing continued strong share gains. One of the interesting metrics I was
provided recently by John at a recent conference was that you saw a $1.7 billion benefit just from share gains in
Global Markets. And just given some of the momentum in the Investment Banking side, I didn't know if you could
help frame how much of a revenue benefit you've seen from those share gains, and is there any risk to any sort of
disruption in the current environment, especially given the Biden executive order that was recently published?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, a couple of thoughts on that broadly. I mean, the environment for Investment Banking activity, Steven,
continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there's a good chance that that will continue to play
forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues.
In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic, there were a handful of factors that we think
are structurally driving CEOs and boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an
increasingly evolving digital world. And we're seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with
respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go forward basis in a world that's actually
evolving quite quickly.
I'm encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high, record levels. And a lot of that, I think,
feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment. Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or
an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn't
seem likely given where we are positioned today.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
With respect to Global Markets, we picked up 160 basis points of market share through quarter one and that's
allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us. I don't have specific market
share KPIs on Investment Banking to share right on this call. We can certainly follow-up more broadly on some
things.
Obviously, we tracked our – we track our league table position both in M&A and equity and debt. And there we've
been strengthening our position over time, and it's consistently at the top of those league tables. What I do say is
affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to
really expand that footprint. And the footprint of available clients that, let's say, are in the $500 million to $3 billion
enterprise value has been significant. It's grown, and we've continued to expand that footprint, and we're quite
effective at penetrating that.
And so that's been a very good opportunity for us, and I actually think that opportunity will continue. I think our
Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue, as we have been, to be a leader in
that business over the course of the last decades. And the quality of the talent we have in that business continues
to be strong, differentiated and very, very front footed with our clients. And so there certainly could be macro
events over 12, 24, 36-month period that slow down the current momentum, but at the moment, it feels quite
constructive.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, thanks for all that color, David. And just for my follow-up, relating to a line of questioning, tied to Christian's
question, just on the equity investment portfolio. Recognizing that barring a net reduction in that portfolio,
understanding there's other metrics we have to monitor, it might be difficult to really see any meaningful SCB
improvement at least in the near term. I was hoping to get some perspective just given the multiple rerating that
you've seen, the strong momentum in the business as well as the fact that SCB is feeling some upward pressure,
whether your views on transformational M&A are evolving at all and whether a potential acquisition could at least
help potentially mitigate some of the pressures from the global market shock that seem to be driving that upward
pressure on the capital ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
At a high level – and I appreciate the question, Steve. I don't think our views on transformational M&A have
evolved. Call after call, quarter-after-quarter, I've said and I'll say again that the bar would always be extremely
high for us to do something very, very significant, but I've also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and
create more durable revenues comes, as both Stephen and I have highlighted in our remarks, from continuing to
invest in and grow our Asset Management business, continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our
Wealth Management business and for broadening our digital consumer banking platform.
There may be opportunities from time to time that can accelerate the direction of travel on those. We look at
things constantly. If we see things that can accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate
our goals in those businesses, we'll certainly consider them, always with a high bar. It wouldn't surprise you that
prices at the moment are high, and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things, but we're
making a lot of progress organically, and we continue to be focused on that organic growth.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just as a incremental follow-up on everything you just said, David, how do we think about the sizing of the equity
investment book that you're looking for? I totally get that markups are adding to this right now, but the $1.5 billion
in addition, there's lots of great opportunities out there. Should we expect that over time, the equity investments
book should be rising? Or is there a goal of size of this portfolio that you're looking to manage to over the next,
call it, two to three years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, the strategy has been to take a broad Asset Management business, and particularly around alternatives that
has been extremely balance sheet heavy and turn it into more of a fund-based model. And we've only started to
really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger
institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly. And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day,
we've raised $75 billion in fund structure.
I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as a GP alongside our
institutional investors. And so, there will always be equity investment through our fund participation, but the cycle
that we're going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much
broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller, and therefore, the overall equity
position will be meaningfully smaller than it's been.
Now it's a good problem that the market keeps going up and therefore the value seems to be staying the same
even though we're making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of
the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven't put out a target
number. But by definition, it will get smaller. In the near-term, our balance sheet will come down, and our AE
target is a little less than $18 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
The only other thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that if you look at page 8 in the presentation, on the left-hand
side, you can see we've been talking a lot about the $21 billion of equity investments, but equally consolidated
investment entities of $18 billion is fertile ground to continue to bring this down and reduce down the AE in the
segment. And so all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term
target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that, and we're committed to get to it,
notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio because, as you rightly point out, that also presents
opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Because I should be thinking about the $21 billion in terms of density of capital usage, kind of the old
methodology...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
...when you were 25%, invested in these funds to new, which is more like three or less percent invested in the
fund. So obviously, the latter is less capital-intensive. I guess the other question is, in addition to page 8 left-hand
side that you mentioned, are there other things we should be thinking about for bringing the SCB down? Or would
you say, hey, look page 8 left-hand side, that's really the bulk of the actions that we are interested in taking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, look, I think the way to think about this is that we're not waiting for the Fed to deliver us a result that's
satisfactory, okay, much as we're petitioning them on some issues that are relevant. We're taking a lot of self-help
here. We've been talking about one, the overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor in to the way in
which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation.
So it's not just limited to this. It means what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David
spoke about and I did, of $75 billion and growing in fund format. What does it mean in the context of a growing
consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction
banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way, presumably by the Fed, to yield a better
PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we're not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of
considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on-balance sheet investing. And then, again, we
remain quite engaged with the Fed as we put our letter in last year, and we'll only serve to reinforce those issues
this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask about M&A, the advisory business in banking, and
Steven touched on this, but maybe I wanted to be a bit more explicit. So we've seen a bit more hawkishness on
the antitrust side, not only with the recent executive order, but also with some of the actions tied to certain deals.
What kind of an impact do you expect this might happen – have on volumes and velocity in the M&A market
broadly? And I believe you touched on the fact that sponsor activity was a big – has been a big contributor to
M&A volume. How much of that sponsor activity do you get the sense is driven by some kind of tax motivation
given all the talk about the potential for rising taxes? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
Sure. I'm going to answer the second part first, and then I'll circle back on the executive order and kind of the
broader roadmap around M&A. But I don't think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this
point is a broad, diverse business. There's enormous dry powder. There is an enormous amount of money that
moves in that ecosystem. There's real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to
increase their weighting to alternatives. It's one of the reasons why the strategy we're focused as one of the
leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that because there's lots of demand for our
clients. And so I don't think that there's any overlay from a tax perspective that's accelerating activity there. I do
think that activity has accelerated because the market environment is quite constructive, and it's been quite a
constructive environment for asset prices generally.
With respect to the broad M&A environment and antitrust and the executive order, I mean, obviously, the
executive order, I think, serves as the roadmap for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current
administration would like to get done over the next four years that relate broadly to competition, consumer
protection issues. It's a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It's something that I think we'll have to watch very,
very closely. Ultimately, the order can't direct the agencies that make the antitrust decisions to make those
decisions, but it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact. But
the agencies will have to, over time, put forward or through the actions they take, create more transparency on
that.
We'll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I
think there's a tipping in the balance that could, in the margin, have some impact on certain transactions. I'd
certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation, there'll certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I
think it's early, and I think you have to watch it closely. And I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from
the macro environment and some of the things I said earlier about companies' desires to really strengthen their
competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we're going to have to watch that very carefully.

Brennan Hawken Q

Great. Thanks for that color, David. And then for my second question, there's been a lot of press coverage
recently around junior banking – junior banker frustration, and we've seen some competitors increase comp for
the junior levels as a result. Do you think any of those developments will impact retention at Goldman? And do
you have any specific plans or intentions to respond to this development yourselves? And what kind of impact do
you think that might have? Thanks.

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Brennan. I appreciate the question. And as we've highlighted earlier in the call, we're quite proud of our
leading Investment Banking franchise. It's been a leading franchise for decades. And I think one of the primary
reasons it's been a leading franchise is because of the quality of the people that we're able to attract and retain at
Goldman Sachs who serve our clients and serve our clients extraordinarily well. We have always paid very
competitively. We've always been a pay-for-performance organization. We are performing. We have a normal pay
cycle. For analysts that normal pay cycle happens to be in August, and we'll continue to pay competitively and
pay for performance. But that's part of our strategy that's been in place for a long time and it will obviously
continue.
With respect to salaries, we evaluate salaries in regular course every single year. And when appropriate, we
make sure our salaries are competitive. So we continue to thrive by having the best people here and paying them

So look, it looks like revenues and profits per employee are up over the last year, last five years, even while
you've grown employees, what, 4% year-over-year and 17% over five years. So I think what would be sustainable
is if you're lowering unit costs and generating revenues for lower marginal costs. So my question is, how much
has technology helped you to lower unit cost and how much more is ahead? And from the outside, there's no way
we can compute that. You have private equity gains. You have a lot of moving parts. But on the inside of the firm,
I imagine you are tracking this in some manner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I'll start and Stephen will add, Mike. But at a high level and we've talked about this, we've talked about efficiency
in the firm. We've talked about digitization. We've talked about connectivity to our clients and ways that
technology can leverage our ability to serve our clients, all of that continues and there's a significant investment
going into that, making the firm more efficient, but most importantly, levering our people's capabilities to better
serve our clients. I think that we are in the third inning of that evolution. There is more opportunity, but there have
been some real gains. And, Stephen can probably quantify on some basis how we think about that, but I think
there's a lot more opportunity for us to continue through digitization and the way we connect with our clients and
the tools we use to create more leverage broadly. And so we continue to be focused on that. Stephen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Mike, the way we look at it and compute it is, we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of
different work streams, take risk, for example, where there's mandatory production of tens of thousands of
reports, either by regulators or consumption internally. And we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where
we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays
forward.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen, and the production of higher
marginal margins are going to play out by virtue of the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of
these businesses, take transaction banking, take the consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms
like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we've got an embedded base
that is built to scale, and those businesses will scale over time over the medium to long-term, and the effective
unit cost, if you will, of producing what we do will come down.
And so that's just a sense both in the spot, zero-based budgeting, risk, et cetera, but equally on the forward in
terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business.

Mike Mayo Q

And as it relates to the executive order from the White House, with you guys positioned as a potential disruptor in
the consumer business, what do you make and what are the possibilities for you to benefit from making it easier
to transport customer data from bank to bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I would say a couple of things. I mean one is to repeat what David said, which is it's a bit early, right now a
week into the issuance of the executive order as to exactly how that plays, okay? From our perspective, we
started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper. So we're not retrofitting a series of transactions or
incumbent businesses. And so, as we look to continue to build the consumer platform, we're quite open to the
notion that there will be shared set of data. The data will be portable.
Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want, what does the
customer need and the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform. And so these products are all about
the design, utilization of data. We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren,
which is, we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We're no different than any other
bank. We take that responsibility seriously. But I think on the new build, on a white sheet of paper, we're less
burdened by these issues, less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it
and where we can build.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is that when we started building this business four or five years ago, it
certainly was in our vision of the world that customers would have a lot more flexibility to move their data and
attach to different platforms. And so certainly, in our macro design of where we think the world is going, the
direction of travel that way is not something that's surprising to us.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yes. Sure. Okay. So let me take the three pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever
confident in the achievement of that. And you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron
indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the
2022 time line that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion. So confident in the existing number and giving
an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually
with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people.
And so that's where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives.
In terms of comp and non-comp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we've
always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We'll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to
sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent.
I will say, as we've said in the past on compensation that the compensation as sort of a call out component to
operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these
scaled businesses. And so therefore, you'll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we
have historically been rather preoccupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself. That's less a reflection of
any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It has more to do with the composition of
businesses that we're building and the kind of non-comp intensity of expenses related to it.
On non-comp expense, I would say we have in virtually every one of the recent quarters been quite focused on
ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is our non-comp expense, normalized for
kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top line of the
firm. So this quarter, as I noted, while the as-reported non-comp expense is down about 43%, that's influenced
very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it
like-for-like, our non-comp expense is up 6% against the 16% top line revenue growth. I think that should be a
guidepost for how we're going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward.
On the third question, you asked about funding optimization. Here, I would say we are – we remain committed
and confident in the achievement of $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about
increased non-deposit fundings or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in
total for the firm is going up. It's going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm. In as
much as we grow non-bank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We're doing that now
at a lower price point than where we were before. It's indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so we're confident
that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and
take us to $1 billion of run rate savings within the timeframe.

Wanted to quickly follow up on transaction banking and just trying to better understand some of the traction just
given such strong growth in the quarter. And what I'd like to dig in a little bit is around the 300 clients that you
mentioned, do you have any just kind of the wallet share that you're seeing? And what I'm getting at is, are
clients, I guess, currently just testing your platform and so there's kind of maybe significant embedded potential as
those clients move more balances over? So, any flavor for that? And then it seems like success is going to be
getting more success here as proof-of-concept has obviously been established. And so just any other color on
kind of what you're seeing in the sales process and whether there's an acceleration in bringing customers on now
that it's fully established?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Devin. So I would say the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we
anticipated, but the way in which it's happening is as we anticipated, which is that we are not new to any one of
the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There's a longstanding corporate relationship that has opened
the door. We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable
business, we recognized that there was a progression. We have large corporates that have a platform of three or
four participating banks that our break in point was to be number three or four, and this wasn't conditioned on us
jumping to the number one spot on that platform out of the box.
Now my view is that as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on
the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the
transaction banking platform, and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow. If we began at 3 or 4,
we'll see ourselves to 2 and perhaps 1, and that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are
formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm. So that sell-through is, as we
expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth, and that's kind of progression.
I would also say that that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that
we will see because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business,
percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational, therefore, more valuable. And so that, I
think, is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it
were for any given corporate client.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess I just wanted to follow up on your outlook around your mid-teens ROE target. You've talked, David, a lot
about the revenue durability and reducing the capital density, both of which should eventually be accretive to the
ROE profile. But when you look at how the market values the stock today, I think there's some skepticism around
where the ROE could be if there's a downturn in the cycle. Just talk to us if you could in your view where do you
think the firm is over-earning versus under-earning from an ROE standpoint? And what's the net-net outcome of
those two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think broadly speaking, we're performing very well across a very, very diverse platform of businesses.
Certainly, I can't predict the future. There certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where
economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-à-vis the levels of activity we're seeing
today. On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our
business that perform quite well and have some counter cyclicality. So I think we have a big at-scale business.
We are at scale in a number of our businesses and a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the
cycle to produce very, very good returns.
I think we're building other businesses that, as Stephen highlighted, are going to be scaling. Some of them are
different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent, modellable – more consistent returns
that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are
durable through the cycle, and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so I believe if we
continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way
others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we're going to continue to focus on serving our clients,
growing these businesses, expanding the platforms. And my belief is the market will follow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean to some extent, if you reflect on David's comments, ROE is nothing but numerator over denominator. And
so we're controlling both revenue intake and expense in the context of the numerator and equally working hard to
do what we can of our own volition to reduce down the denominator in the context of SCB. But the reality is we sit
22

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
where we sit. We're changing kind of the dynamic of the business profile, all to yield a higher ROE which will
translate, as David suggested, into the potential for a much better look at the valuation of the firm overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. And I'd just add broadly, the kind of environment that obviously affects our returns, certainly, when you look
historically, it's affected other of our peer institutions returns too. There are differences in our business, but I don't
think they are as different as they're amplified from time-to-time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just as a follow-up on the consumer strategy. Can you achieve significant scale over the next few
years without doing something inorganic? Or do you think you can build out without having to do any meaningful
M&A and still create a sizable business in a reasonable timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
We absolutely think that we can build an at-scale business over the course of the next three to five years without
doing something inorganic. If we saw something that we thought could accelerate that or enhance that, we'd
certainly consider it. But we have a detailed plan that gives us what we think is a scalable, which is an at-scale
significant business over the next five years and we're going to continue to invest and continue to execute against
it. And as we said a number of times, those investments and that drive to do that is not affecting our either mid or
slightly longer-term return targets and thresholds that we continue to drive towards.

So there's been an acceleration of the electronification of FICC. There was a good article, I think, over the
weekend on this specifically within credit. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit about this. And I know you've
invested a lot on the technology side on both sides of trading, but how does this kind of shape up for you in terms
of thinking about your share going forward, assuming this trend continues?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So in the context of our credit business in FICC, this has been an area of considerable investment from a
technology point of view because we needed to and wanted to migrate from what was kind of high touch to low
touch and pick up high volume, lower-margin business. And so portfolio trading algos, the introduction of them,
the development of digital platforms where asset managers, insurance companies can come and execute on
those platforms using Marquee has been a very, very significant and somewhat elevated prospect for us in terms
of overall performance.
It's also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies. It's all in the
context of where a client of the firm can come either through Marquee or otherwise, and through an API, use data
and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute. And that is a growing piece of the overall credit business in
FICC and an area where we think that there is enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow.
And so we're seeing monthly users around Marquee accelerate, API interaction accelerate, all in the context of
kind of the underlying premise to your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
And then just following-up on FICC. I know it's always annoying when you get asked about like near-term trends,
but we've seen some unusual activity in rates the last month with the move down, especially in the longer end.
We've seen some correction in certain areas of commodities. Has this caused clients to reposition, like change
views and driving more activity? Or are most clients' views thinking specifically on rates, I guess, that it's more
temporary and not doing a lot of repositioning with the move we've had?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think volume intake in [ph] ERP (01:15:49) has been reasonably volatile, meaning we've seen around
certain rate crosscurrents and the overall debate around inflation, permanent or transitory is expressing itself in
increased client activity in [ph] ERP (01:16:02) and then moments of more muted activity. So [ph] ERP (01:16:08)
has been in both places over the last several months.
In the commodities business, I would say that we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater
product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients. So for example,
our business used to be in commodities, almost 50% oil. And now oil is more like 20%, and we see greater
product dispersion across gas, power, metals and ags. I think that's good for our business, and it reflects our
reaction to, as I say, an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of
product sets within commodities itself.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Stephen, you touched on in your opening prepared remarks about you're positioned well for loan growth
accelerating going forward. Can you give us some additional color on where you see this loan growth
materializing possibly over the next 6 to 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So let me talk a little bit about where we've seen loan growth now because I think it's reflective of the
forward. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we
extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It's a great feeder in the context of our
engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that's created by virtue of meeting the borrowings. And
this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that's borrowing. We've seen more lending in the
context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a
larger fee pool in the context of where we are.
In Global Markets, we've seen ourselves, and I mentioned this in mortgages, around warehouse financing. So this
is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what's there. So the positioning I'm
speaking about is both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeve in which
we're lending and perhaps, more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in in the context of lending into any
one of those particular client segments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, you've all seen and we've all seen that the reverse repo market has
grown dramatically since the first of the year. In fact, in the last three to four months, the Fed, in fact, raised the
rate that they pay on those reverse repos by – up to 5 basis points. Can you guys share with us your insights,
what the implications are of what's going on in the plumbing, if you will, of the financial system here in the States
with quantitative easing, the reverse repos and how that might be affecting or impacting favorably your trading
businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, look, any time there is kind of a differentiated view on rates or the markets broadly, as David mentioned, that
tends to bleed to a positive outcome for our business more broadly in Global Markets. Meaning, to the extent that
there's greater volatility, greater activity at wider bid offer spreads, it's a positive outcome in the overall
performance of our business. Hard for me to give you specific judgments on what's happening specifically as it
25

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2021
relates to the transmission of what's going on in TRS relating to the revenue in the business itself, but I would say
that it portends a positive for our business in the context of overall client activity.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on capital management from here and how we should think about
pace of buybacks, et cetera. You guys have about 100 basis point cushion over your SCB, I guess, 40 basis
points in the SLR. Can you maybe just refresh us on what your management buffers you're targeting, how to think
about the dynamic going forward between just balance sheet growth, loan growth versus what you're trying to do
on the buyback side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So first on SCB and SLR, SCB is more binding to us than SLR. We don't view SLR as being a binding
constraint, much as we obviously watch it and maintain an adequate buffer around it, but SCB is more binding
than SLR. As it relates to SCB, we have long said that we maintain a 50 to 100 basis point buffer – management
buffer above our minimum. I see no reason to sort of change that view. We do view that buffer not simply as a
defensive tool, but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of
capital when and if clients look to petition us for it.
Actually, during the second quarter, that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were
momentarily capital consumptive. The buffer enabled us to do that and engage. Just one obviously factual point
which is we're at 13.6% under SCB for this – the third quarter. We go down to 13.4% in the fourth quarter, relative
to the most recent CCAR outcome.
As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is we've obviously taken the dividend
up, reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm, and we look to deploy capital
at returns. And if they continue to demonstrate mid-20% return on equity, you will see us continue to deploy
capital in that direction. To the extent that that falls off for whatever reason, we will take up our share repurchase
in that regard, but you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter. This
is really a question of whether it moves up or down, and that's a function of the kind of return opportunities that we
see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
So you're – I mean, just so we have a good understanding, it's just saying, it's going to be pretty dynamic quarter-
to-quarter in terms of what pace of buybacks. If you see an opportunity, you'll do it and vice-versa.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
That's precisely right. Yes.

Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thank you. Good morning. Just one quick follow-up, please. You talked about regulatory investigations around
Archegos. You said it's too early to know the outcome. But are you seeing other firms pulling back in prime or in
equities more broadly as a consequence of the Archegos situation? Is that any part of the market share gains that
you've been seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, hard to tie point A to point B, but you've obviously seen open expressions by other firms who are looking to
reduce down their prime business. We're going the other way. We want to grow that business. But as I say, we're
growing that business with every element of prudence as to pricing and term structure and the like. But I suspect
clients in motion around prime are coming to Goldman Sachs as they are to others, and we are looking to sort of
grow that business more broadly.
