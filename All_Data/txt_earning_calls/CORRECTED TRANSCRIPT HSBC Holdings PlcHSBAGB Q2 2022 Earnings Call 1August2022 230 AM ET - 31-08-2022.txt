There have been reports in recent months about ideas for alternative structures for HSBC. The board has been
fully engaged in examining these ideas in depth and we will continue that thorough examination. Noel will discuss
this in more detail during the presentation. The board firmly believes that as these results clearly demonstrate,
HSBC's strategy is working and expect that it will deliver very good returns over the coming years.
For 157 years, we have followed trade and investment flows to support our customers as they fulfill their financial
ambitions. We have used our deep experience and strong global relationships to help our customers to navigate
the world. Today, we remain steadfastly focused on our core purpose of opening up a world of opportunity. Our
model is increasingly relevant to individuals and to companies of all sizes and whose financial ambitions span
multiple countries and regions.
Our transformation has enabled us to emerge from the pandemic a stronger bank and well positioned to capitalize
on the current interest rate cycle. And very few banks can rival our ability to connect capital, ideas and people
through a global network that facilitates the international collaboration required to succeed in today's world. The
focus for the board and the management team is on delivering our strategy precisely because it is the best way
for us to support our customers and to improve returns.
With that, let me hand over to Noel.

Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone in Hong Kong. It's great to be here to present our half-year
results, and good morning to everyone in London. Before I turn to progress against our strategy, a brief reminder
of the context. As Mark said, our purpose as an organization is opening up a world of opportunity. These words
are a product of extensive consultation with our customers, our colleagues about who we are and what we do,
and I strongly believe that our strength as a global institution comes from our ability to connect the major trading
blocks of the world. I will come back to the value of our connectivity and strategy later on.
The next slide sets out the key points that we're going to cover in our presentation today. First, we've had another
strong performance in the second quarter. I'm pleased that reported revenue grew by 2% on last year's second
quarter and was up 12% on an adjusted basis, adjusted profits before tax were up 13% on the same period last
year, and continued strong cost control led to positive adjusted jaws of 12%.
Second, we've made good progress with our transformation program. If you look back a few years ago, we had
lossmaking businesses in the US and Europe and capital was being used inefficiently. We have structurally
repositioned our portfolio of businesses and our operating model for higher returns. The two most material
adjustments in our portfolio have been the exit and wind down of non-strategic assets and clients in the US and
Europe and the strong impetus behind organic and inorganic growth in Asia, especially in Wealth and Personal
Banking. This reposition effect is starting to pay off in terms of growth and returns as these results show.
Third, it's the benefit of transformation and the tailwinds from higher interest rates that allow me to announce
some ambitious new targets and underpinning guidance even against the challenging economic backdrop. After
delivering an annualized return on tangible equity of 9.9% in the first half, we are confident of delivering at least
12% from 2023 onwards. This would represent our best financial performance for a decade.
Finally, as a result, we are providing more specific guidance of a 50% dividend payout ratio for 2023 and 2024.
We understand and appreciate the importance of dividends to all our shareholders so we will aim to restore the
dividend to pre-COVID levels as soon as possible. We also intend to revert to quarterly dividends in 2023.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
Let me now walk you through the progress we've made in the first half of this year in transforming the bank. In
Asia Wealth, our investments over the past few years are gaining traction. We've made a series of bolt-on
acquisitions to accelerate our progress. In the first half, we completed the acquisition of AXA Singapore and we
remain on track to complete the acquisition of L&T Investment Management in India. And in Mainland China, we
continue to build momentum on the back of 17 new licenses and regulatory approvals gained since the start of
2020, 7 of which were in the first six months of this year.
We've got strong revenue momentum across all of our businesses, with 4% of the adjusted revenue growth in the
first half after turning the corner on revenue back in 2021. Normalizing interest rates give us confidence in the
returns trajectory for the coming years as we will explain later. We have also got good cost control, with adjusted
cost stable in the first half despite inflation and higher spending on technology.
We had an annualized return on tangible equity in the first half of 9.9%. We have now made cumulative RWA
saves of $114 billion and remain on track to exceed $120 billion as we continue to exit assets and clients that do
not add value to our international proposition. Our CET1 ratio was 13.6% and we aim to manage back to within
our target range, 14% to 14.5%, during the first half of 2023. Our capital allocation to growth opportunities in Asia
and Wealth and Personal Banking also showed good progress.
We have a strong focus across our network today. When you combine exiting unprofitable businesses and
underproductive RWAs with tighter costs and an impetus for growth, you get much better geographic
performance, with every region profitable in the first half. One of the standout performers was the HSBC UK,
which contributed $2.5 billion of adjusted profits, up 15% on the first half of last year. Many of you heard about the
fantastic job that Ian Stuart and the UK team are doing at the recent Investor Day. If not, please do look at the
materials on the website.
Looking forward, our transformation also means we can expect the current rate cycle to bring higher returns than
previous rates cycles because we have more liquidity, less risk and much higher operating leverage. The level of
surplus deposits we hold means we're very well positioned to benefit as higher rates kick in. We also now have
less risk in our two key books, the retail unsecured loan book and the SME lending book. We have around $91
billion of business banking deposits in Hong Kong and around $55 billion of business banking deposits in the UK
at very low AD ratios, and we have outperformed our peers on cost management in recent years.
The next few slides cover our four strategic pillars starting with a focus on our strengths. Our market-leading
Commercial Banking franchise had a very strong first half. Revenue was up 14% on last year. Within that, it was
particularly promising that there was fee income growth of more than 12%. Trade revenue in Commercial Banking
increased by nearly $200 million or 20%, driven by a 25% increase in average trade balances as clients trusted
us to help them navigate supply chain shifts. GLCM was up 42% with a strong benefit from interest rates
normalizing, and by geography, every region performs strongly. Revenues were up 19% in the UK, up 5% in
Hong Kong, up 18% in the rest of Asia, and up 12% in the rest of the world.
In Wealth and Personal Banking, the impacts of the transformation I described is particularly evident. Net new
invested assets in Wealth grew by 9% in the first half. In Asia, we achieved significantly more positive dollar
growth than was reported recently by our European wealth management peers, and it was great to see the value
of new business in our Asia insurance franchise grow by 41%, all despite adverse market conditions.
Revenue in Wealth and Personal Banking was stable, but excluding market impacts and a gain on pricing
updates on policyholders' funds, it was up by 7%. Personal Banking had a very strong half. Lending balances

were up 4% driven by a strong our UK mortgages performance, and looking at revenue by geography excluding
market impacts and the insurance gain, the UK was up 22%, Mexico was up 16%, while Hong Kong remained
resilient, down only 1% despite the impact of COVID restrictions. All of this underlines the way we structurally
repositioned the business. We should now get the benefit of normalizing rates on top of that.
Global Banking and Markets also performed very well in the first half, reflecting our differentiated and diversified
business model. Strong revenue performances in transaction banking and our Markets business were driven by
rate rises and continued good levels of client activity. Collaboration between Global Banking and Markets and
Commercial Banking is a priority so I was particularly pleased to see these collaboration revenues increase by
14%.
Back in February, I talked about the proportion of Global Banking and Markets client business booked in the East
but originated in Europe and the Americas. In the first half, this revenue grew by around 8% on the same period
last year, underlying the strength of our connected franchise. We will continue to invest in coverage and build
share in connecting capital and trade flows between the world's major economic blocks.
Digitizing HSBC continues to improve the client experience and make our processes more efficient. We've
continued to raise our spending on technology, with more than half spent on change the bank initiatives to drive
growth and efficiencies. This is in spite of the commitment to keep our overall costs stable in 2022. We've more
than doubled the proportion of our agile workforce over the past year, which we expect to translate into a much
faster release frequency for new features and propositions.
Our cloud adoption across public and private cloud continue to increase beyond 30% with an ambition to go much
further. And across trade, HSBCnet and retail mobile, penetration levels and volumes increased materially, with
ambitions to grow them even further.
The next slide covers our last two strategic pillars. First, we're continuing to build a dynamic and inclusive culture.
We remain on track to achieve our revised target of 35% of senior leadership roles filled by women by 2025. The
total number of hours spent by colleagues learning about sustainability, digital and data increased sevenfold,
reflecting the increased priority placed on future skills. And to give you an example of how we're opening up a
world of opportunity for our people, we're rolling out a Talent Marketplace which uses AI to match colleagues with
short-term projects and learning based on their skills and ambitions.
Then on transition to net zero, the amount of sustainable financing and investment that we provided and
facilitated were stable on the first half of last year despite the overall market for green, social and sustainability,
and sustainability-linked bonds being down in the first half. The overall amount of sustainable finance and
investment provided and facilitated since the start of 2020 now stands at more than $170 billion, well on our way
towards our target of up to $1 trillion by 2030.
The next slide shows why we're confident of keeping adjusted costs stable in 2022, and our ambition is to keep
cost growth to around 2% in 2023 despite strong inflation headwinds. It comes down to three things. First, good
cost discipline across the whole group. Second, our efficiency levers. We're reducing the global real estate
footprint, reducing our global retail infrastructure, using more automation, and reducing our operations head
count. We're still only partway through these journeys, with an ambition to achieve even greater savings.
Finally, we will continue to see the impact of our current transformation programs into next year. The flow-through
benefits into 2023 are also a big component and will be an important help to offset inflation. This brings me to
expectations for the rest of 2022 and 2023. I've explained how we've structurally repositioned the business to

achieve higher returns once rates normalize. Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we're
expecting at least $37 billion of net interest income in 2023, which is a significant uplift on the $31 billion-plus we
expected in 2022. We're aiming to keep cost growth at around 2% in 2023 which we fully expect to be able to do
for the reasons I've explained.
Given all of this, we are materially upgrading our returns guidance. We are confident of achieving a return on
tangible equity of at least 12% from 2023 onwards. As a result, we are also providing more specific guidance of a
50% dividend payout ratio for 2023 and 2024. We aim to restore the dividend to pre-COVID levels as soon as
possible and we will also revert to quarterly dividend from 2023 onwards.
I'll speak to a few more slides at the end. But let me now hand over to Ewen to take you through the numbers in
detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon all. As Noel and Mark have said, it's really great to be in Hong Kong
for these results.
We had another strong quarter. Reported pre-tax profits of $5 billion. While down 1% on last year's second
quarter, this marks a strong core operating performance. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted
revenues were up 12%, including net interest income up 20%. With operating expenses flat, we had 12% positive
jaws. Adjusted pre-tax profits were up 13% and profits attributable to ordinary shareholders were up 62%.
Credit conditions remained benign in the quarter. ECLs were $448 million net charge compared with a net release
last year. We benefited from a $1.8 billion deferred tax asset credit in the quarter, reflecting a recognition of
brought-forward tax losses in the UK given the improved profitability outlook. We now expect 2022 effective tax
rate of around 10%, reverting to a more normalized effective tax rate of around 20% in 2023.
To remind you for 2022 dividend modeling purposes, please exclude the DTA gain and the French loss on
disposal being noncash significant items, but include the $3.4 billion of cost to achieve we expect to spend this
year and other significant items.
Our core Tier 1 ratio was 13.6%. Our tangible net asset value per share was $7.48, down $0.32 on the first
quarter, mainly due to FX impacts, but also to the fourth quarter 2021 dividend payment. And we've announced
an interim dividend of $0.09 per share, up $0.02 on the first half of 2021.
On the next slide, there was a strong adjusted revenue performance across all our global businesses. Wealth and
Personal Banking revenues were up 5% overall and up 19% if you exclude $700 million of adverse market
impacts and insurance. Underlying this, Personal Banking had a strong quarter, revenues up 20%, reflecting both
rate rises and balance sheet growth. Commercial Banking was up 19% with growth across all core products due
to improved margins and balance sheet growth and revenues driven by collaboration with Global Banking and
Markets.
Global Banking and Markets revenues were up 15%, mainly due to global markets and security services and
global liquidity and cash management. Net fee income was down 4%. The decline in fees from wealth and
investment banking was partly offset by the $100 million increase in global liquidity and cash management and
trade fees, underlying the benefit of our diversified business model.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
On slide 17, net interest income was $7.5 billion, up 20% against last year's second quarter on an adjusted basis.
On rates, the net interest margin was 135 basis points, up 9 basis points on the fourth quarter and up 16 basis
points compared with the fourth quarter last year as higher asset yields more than offset increased liability costs.
And on volumes, we had underlying loan growth in the quarter of 5% annualized, but we saw a decline in average
interest earning assets due to FX.
Based upon current FX on the consensus rates outlook, we now expect net interest income of at least $31 billion
for 2022 and at least $37 billion in 2023 as we return to a more normalized rates environment.
On the next slide, we provide some buildup to our net interest income forecasts on the rates assumptions. As I
said, our forecast today are based on current FX rates and the current consensus rates outlook, as you know,
with low pass-through rates at the moment, but we expect this to increase going into 2023. On volumes, we're
forecasting mid-single-digit loan growth in 2023.
Turning to slide 19, we reported a net charge of $448 million of ECLs in the quarter or 17 basis points. This
included a further $140 million relating to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. Outside of this one
specific portfolio, the overall quality of our book remains good. Stage 3 loans, as a percentage of total loans,
remained stable at around 1.8%. At this stage, we're not seeing signs of portfolio stress across our key early
warning indicators and defaults in July remains low, but we continue to monitor the situation closely.
While the first-half ECL charge was only 21 basis points, we continue to expect ECLs to normalize towards 30
basis points of average loans for the full year with the core driver of this the risk of further deterioration in forward
economic guidance rather than any sharp upturn in stage 3 losses.
Turning to the next slide, second quarter operating expenses were stable versus the same period last year as
cost savings and reduction in accrued variable pay offset the continued increased investment in technology and
growth. We made a further $500 million of cost program savings during the second quarter with an associated
cost to achieve of $600 million.
As Noel said, we remain on track for stable adjusted operating expenses this year. Assuming FX remains at June
levels for the remainder of 2022, that would be around $30.5 billion of operating expenses. We're also on track to
achieve the top end of our three-year $5 billion to $5.5 billion cost savings target, and now expect to see a further
$1 billion of cost savings from this program flow through to 2023, which will be a material mitigant against the
higher inflation we're seeing.
As part of this cost program, we've now spent $4.6 billion of our $7 billion cost to achieve budget that ends in the
fourth quarter. We still expect to spend the remaining $2.4 billion during the second half of this year.
For 2023, despite the inflationary trends we're seeing, we're still aiming for cost growth of around 2%. The
environment is highly volatile, but we do not intend to allow the yield curve to weaken our commitment to cost
discipline.
Turning to capital on slide 21, our core Tier 1 ratio was 13.6%, down 50 basis points on the first quarter. This
included underlying risk-weighted asset movements from lending growth and data and methodology
enhancements. Post-tax fair value losses through other comprehensive income as interest rate rose and
increased threshold deductions as core Tier 1 capital fell. We expect our core Tier 1 ratio to fall further during the
third quarter. This includes the announced sale of our French retail banking operations, which, based on current
FX rates, is expected to have an impact of around 30 basis points. We expect core Tier 1 to recover materially in
7

the fourth quarter, back towards 14%, given additional capital management actions we're now taking and then be
back within our 14% to 14.5% target range during the first half of 2023.
So, in summary, this was a strong quarter. We're firmly on track to achieve significantly improved operating
performance, returns, and distributions from 2023 onwards, with interest rates rapidly normalizing and a post-
COVID recovery in most markets. We're seeing strong revenue growth, up 12% on a year ago. With continued
cost discipline, we've achieved a 12% operating jaws this quarter. While not complacent, the experience of our
credit portfolio remains benign. Based upon the normalization of interest rates, with at least $37 billion of net
interest income in 2023 and the continued core operating performance improvement we're driving, we're raising
our expectations for 2023 and beyond, our return on tangible equity of at least 12%. And on the back of this, we
expect to see a material uplift in distributions from 2023 onwards.
With that, back to Noel for a few closing comments.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Ewen.
I'd like to end with a few slides before Q&A. When we began to accelerate our strategy in February 2021, one of
our four strategic pillars was to focus on our strengths. As you have seen from the material today and throughout
our history, we have no greater strength than our ability to bridge capital and trade flows between the major
economic blocks of the world.
We're the world's leading trade bank, one of the largest payments providers globally, and one of the largest FX
houses in the world. And even as trade flows have changed and supply chains have shifted, we've taken market
share in trade because our network means we can go wherever trade goes. We also command a 20% wallet
share of wholesale banking client business from Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas into Asia.
Outside of revenue, our international model has also started delivering synergies in our cost base, particularly
through digitization where we can build ones, deploy globally at much lower costs. And there are also capital and
funding synergies through the greater diversification of our portfolio and the interconnectivity within it.
In the past, investors could not fully assess all that value because parts of our portfolio drag down the overall
returns below the cost of capital. So, the work we have done over the past few years to tightly control costs,
reduce capital allocated to low-return, domestic-orientated businesses, and the increased investment in higher
growth, higher return geographies in Asia and in businesses such as Wealth, will allow us to demonstrate the
value of our international strategy much more clearly as is evident in our forward guidance of at least 12% returns
in 2023 and beyond.
International connectivity is core to our entire value proposition, from clients to employees, and has contributed to
our improved returns. 45% of our wholesale client business is booked cross-border. And a large proportion of the
revenue is booked domestically for wholesale clients comes to us because of the business we do for those clients
overseas, and we will continue to grow that number. Similarly, in Wealth and Personal Banking, international is
the most attractive and fastest-growing segment. A product like Global Money and our wealth platforms, which
are some of our highest return propositions, are specifically designed to capitalize on our international
connectivity for our retail and wealth customers. You will continue to see more propositions from us in this space.
And that's because the average international customer revenue is around double the average domestic-only
customer.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
In addition, in a highly competitive talent marketplace, especially in Asia, our internationalism is core to our
employee value proposition and how our colleagues think about us. There has been a debate recently about our
international model and specifically whether alternative structural options would create more value for our
shareholders. As you would expect, we have considered many of these options over recent years.
More recently, we have updated our analysis with the benefit of independent third-party financial and legal advice.
It has been our judgment that alternative structural options will not deliver increased value for shareholders, rather
they would have a material negative impact on value. And our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to get
to higher returns and dividends we all want to see.
When considering different structural options for the bank, we need to make judgements on a range of factors,
which we think would materially impact valuation outcomes. Clearly, the primary factor is about disruption, too,
and the potential loss of the international synergies I just highlighted. But it's not only about synergies. There are
significant cost and execution risk that would need to be considered for any alternative structural option. Past
experience in the market, as evidenced by carving out a relatively small European bank in a single market, can
take more than $2 billion, and even then has a high risk of failure. So, you can understand the risks of standing up
separate entities for a franchise of our size.
I won't go through all the points on the slide. Suffice to say, the costs are material. There would be significant
execution risk over a three- to five- year period when clients, employees, and shareholders would all be distracted
and impacted. And there are [ph] obvious day one (00:36:15) risks around capital, distribution, and client exits.
Another point that comes up with investors in this discussion is our geopolitical positioning. As a global bank, we
engage and maintain strong relationships with governments and regulators around the world. Our international
role, our importance to global trade, and our homes in London and Hong Kong underpin our relationships in both
hemispheres. And our customers have trusted us for 157 years to help them to navigate the world as it has
changed. I am putting the factors that we consider when assessing alternative strategies in the public domain, so
all our shareholders can understand the value of our international structure and our strategy.
So, in summary, we've explained today how our strategy will generate significant value for our shareholders. We
remain focused on our strengths of which international connectivity is at the top. Our UK and Hong Kong
franchises are performing very well. And we are shifting capital to areas with the strongest returns. We're
managing cost tightly and we expect at least $37 billion of net interest income next year as rates normalize.
We're simplifying and digitizing the bank. We are engaging and will continue to engage with all our shareholders.
We share their desire for improved returns and understand the importance of dividends to them. We think the best
and safest way to improve returns is to focus on our strategy, which we are confident will deliver a return on
tangible equity of at least 12% from 2023 and materially increase distributions.
With that, can we please open up for questions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Quinn. [Operator Instructions] At this point, we'll hand the call over to Mr. Richard

Thank you, operator. We'll take most of the questions from the audio lines today. We have a few analysts and
investors in Hong Kong who [indiscernible] (00:39:20) from the lines. So, I'll see if anybody raises their hands.
And we got a microphone to come around and hopefully get some questions from Hong Kong.
Can I just ask everybody to limit themselves, as normal, to two questions. But with that, operator, we'll go straight
to the first question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Good morning, everybody. My name is Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. I've got two, one on capital and one on
strategy, please. On capital, when we look at [indiscernible] (00:39:57-00:40:15). I was just wondering if you could
talk about the [indiscernible] (00:40:16-00:40:33) from a timing perspective.
And then the second one is strategy, [indiscernible] (00:40:35-00:40:49). I was wondering if you might be able to
shed a little bit more color in terms of multiple [indiscernible] (00:40:54-00:00:41:02) just to give a sense of the
[indiscernible] (00:41:05). Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. I'll ask Ewen to take both of those questions, do with capital first and then your questions around cost
of executing alternative strategies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Raul, the line wasn't perfectly clear, so I'll do my best. On capital, I think the first part of it was sort of
understanding the moving parts on the rebuild of capital. Yeah. From first half, the 13.6%, obviously we've given
you the M&A impacts that we expect in Q3. In addition to that, we are taking probably about 20 basis points to 30
basis points of incremental capital actions that we previously haven't talked about with the market, which you
should expect to come through in the second half of this year. We also remember that under the Bank of England
PRA rules, we have to accrue dividends at the top end of our 40% to 55% payout ratio.
So, in the first half, effectively, the core Tier 1 ratio is understated because of that accrual and there's a catch-up
that you'll see in Q4. So, we do think that we'll trough next quarter are a bit below where we are. We'll be back
close to 14% by full year. We'll be back within range, 14% to 14.5%, during the first half of next year.
And then your question on buybacks are then links into that, which is you should not expect us to be doing
buybacks until we're back within our core Tier 1 range of 14% to 14.5%, which, yeah, you can imply from that will
be more back-end loaded next year as a result.

Thank you. And just before I get to the detail on or go to the specific that you asked. Just on the alternative
structural options. I think what you've got to take into account is the combination of impacts. There is a negative
impacts on the revenue synergies that we've identified in the paper. There's a negative impact on some of the
funding and capital synergies that exist in the group that's well-diversified. There's a negative impact on the cost
of executing, which are one-off costs. And then there are some ongoing cost impacts in terms of the funding cost
of a less diversified group split into two will be higher than the funding cost of a diversified group. And then, there
are some ongoing running costs that you'd incur.
I think it's the totality of that that you've got to look at and not any one item. And there are many judgment calls to
make in that equation. But whatever way you balance those judgment calls, we believe that the safest and fastest
route to generate increased dividends and increased returns is the strategy that we're pursuing. We'd given you
schedules in the pack and in the appendix to help you understand some of the factors that need to be considered.
So, I don't think there's any one cost item that I think is more relevant than the other [ph] bridge (00:44:26) of the
package. And then you got high execution risk because something of that complex nature can take three years to
five years with uncertain outcome for regulatory approval and for investor approval.

Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, just to give a bit more color around some of the numbers, Raul. I mean, as Noel said, if you just
look at the sort of one-off cost associated with setting up a structure, if you were to have a separately listed Asian
subsidiary, you would have to be able to demonstrate that you had stand-alone IT systems, which would probably
take three years to five years to construct, would run into the probably billions of dollars to be able to do that. You
have a $40 billion MREL stack currently sitting in our Asian subsidiary, all of which is downstream from the parent.
Again, they would be a three- to five-year issuance program required to reissue all of that MREL out to the public
markets and effectively do a liability management exercise on that excess MREL that was sitting at the group.
And then you would have potential tax impacts because of triggering capital gains [indiscernible] (00:45:49)
implications as you did the restructuring and other one-off costs associated with effectively recreating a stand-
alone business here, here being Hong Kong where I am today.
And then you go into the ongoing dyssynergies. For example, in the slides, we've showed you that of the $20
billion of wholesale revenues, 45% of them relate to international customers. So, you can run your own math
somewhat portion of that $9 billion would be at risk but it wouldn't be material. You would have to effectively
duplicate corporate functions and IT run costs that we get global synergies on today. You would lose group
purchasing power benefits that we get today.
We think you would have to operate our Asian business at a higher core Tier 1 ratio as a stand-alone business
because it wouldn't benefit from the group support that it gets today that the HKMA does take into account.
There's about $100 billion of AT1 Tier 1, Tier 2 capital sitting in the rest of the group. We think if you would have
break out the Asian subsidiary, there's a significant risk that the rest of the group would derate from a ratings
perspective. One notch downgrade on that $100 billion we think is a 25-basis-point to 50-basis-point impact per
annum. And our UK business holding company today has a number of tax benefits. The UK has far better
withholding tax arrangements with the rest of the world compared to Hong Kong. And we also get a tax shield on
our UK headquarter costs in the UK.
And then, you go into the complexity of execution. All of the timelines point to three to five years. In that three to
five years, we would have to prioritize IT change in respect of the separation rather than IT change in respect of
the core business. We need reg approval in about 25 jurisdictions. There would be questions around indexation.
We're currently fully indexed in both markets. Yeah, US dollar clearing, we don't think would be available to the
11

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
Asian subsidiary. And we don't think that we would readily be able to get a dollar clearing license for the Asian
subsidiary as we've seen with others.
So, as Noel says, I think when you package all of that up in terms of cost to implement, complexity to implement,
and ongoing to synergies, we just really struggle to come up with any form of value case that we could put in front
of shareholders.

Hi, Manus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the long list of negatives with regards to the breakup costs. I wondered if in the
spirit of [indiscernible] (00:49:10) considerations in the public domain you could discuss what, on the other side of
the ledger, you could be upside potentially of a breakup. Do you think it's possible that you could see faster
growth [indiscernible] (00:49:21). Do you think that you can make better valuation attached to them? Could you
just explain [indiscernible] (00:49:27)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Manus, thank you. I mean, I think we're already seeing strong growth from the execution of the current strategy.
We're already very focused on the growth opportunities in Asia. You can see that in Hong Kong. Our Commercial
Banking business has had very strong growth here in Hong Kong and globally. Trade business is up 20% of the
revenue. So, I think, to be honest, Manus, we've already factored in strong growth opportunities in Asia and we're
deploying more and more capital into Asia. So, I think, for us, we've already got that growth scenario factored into
the current plan.
And then your second point was...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ewen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look. I mean, just to complete – yeah. Can you imagine a different business plan for Asia? Yes, you
could, Manus, but would have to work through all those capital funding, liquidity implications, and risk appetite
implications of that. There's been some suggestions that we could accelerate growth in some areas, but that
would come with a changed risk appetite and therefore changed capital funding and liquidity implications that
we've started to work through. But, again, we don't. We think the overall net dyssynergies outweigh any of those
positive synergies.
Yes, you could speculate that there could be a re-rating of the Asian business if it was separated out. Equally, we
think there would be a de-rating of the rest of the world. So, when we've looked those two together, we haven't
been able to convince ourselves that there's some kind of magic structural alternative that delivers a re-rating for
the overall group.

Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on a good set of numbers. It's
good to see jaws kind of improve so strongly. I've got two questions, please.
So, my first question is on the analysis of the strategic options. And I wanted to ask you, is there anything that
you've decided to do that is incremental to the strategy and it becomes a process that you've gone through in the
past couple of months? And what I can see is that cost efficiencies have moved to the upper end of the range,
13

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
and you're talking about 20 basis points to 30 basis points of additional capital actions. So, I was hoping you could
add a little bit more color specifically on those two points [indiscernible] (00:52:14).
And my second question is on deposit beta. So, one of your peers [indiscernible] (00:52:24) migration from
current and savings accounts to time deposits. I was hoping you could give us some updates on how you're
thinking about the competitive environment in deposits as we go forward. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On your first point, I'll just answer that and I'll pass to Ewen for the second point. I mean, we're very determined to
improve the performance of the business and we take all feedback. [ph] This is (00:52:52) the business hasn't
performed well over the past 10 years. We'd say that's [indiscernible] (00:52:59) and have done and are very
committed to trying to drive out capital efficiency into the business. So, we constantly look at part of the portfolio
that are strategically less important and are underperforming. And we're determined to continue to drive out
efficiency into the capital allocation of the business.
On the specific point of the additional capital management actions we're taking, I think that's in response to the
CET1 impact of the mark-to-market on the treasury book. That's in addition to mitigate the downturn in the CET1
as a consequence of that. But we're confident that the capital build that's coming from higher profitability will start
to reboot CET1 towards the end of this year and into next year. But those capital management actions are not in
response to structural considerations. They're more in response to near-term capital management activities.
Those actions are tactically important and right things to do, but they're not strategically damaging to the franchise
of the bank where we're not having to turn off good strategic growth, we're able to take those actions whilst
pursuing our strategy.
[indiscernible] (00:54:18)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
...what you can see in the results today is an attempt by us to be clearer on what the strategy is. So, giving you
more disclosure around the international connectivity of the business, clarifying what we thought was a significant
gap to our internal views on dividend potential for 2023 and beyond versus where consensus was. So, what we've
tried to do is, if you want, clarify the strategy a lot clearer that we're pursuing.
Look, on deposit betas, we are seeing currently very little migration to time deposit so far. Remember that actually
a significant part of our book is actually not time deposits. But I think if you look at previous cycles, you would
expect migration to occur as interest rates continue to arise.
So, yeah, as we've said previously, the modeling that we've done in the interest rate sensitivity is based on a 50%
pass-through rate. We're well below that at the moment. We do think it will rise from here. And part of the reason
of the rise is because of migration.

Afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank
[indiscernible] (00:55:57) firstly, on your net interest income guidance. So, thank you so much for giving us the
guidance $37 billion. And I note the rate assumptions that you're making behind that I think are laid out on slide
18, i.e., in line with market and price policy rates. I guess, there's a pretty healthy debate amongst investors when
I speak to them as to whether we actually get to those level of interest rates and if they need to get cut, again,
[indiscernible] (00:56:33). So, just interested in your thoughts around to what extent is the [indiscernible]
(00:56:39) as part of the forward curve at the moment. What risk would that post to your RoTE ambitions? And do
you have levers that you can pull if that $37 billion NII guide at risk, say, if you didn't quite get to that circa 3%
base rate for example?
And the second question is just around capital. I note the actions that you're taking can lift the CET1 ratio back
toward target range. But that actual target level, how are you thinking about that? I mean, when I compare that to
your [ph] MDA (00:57:16), there's a pretty [ph] handsome (00:57:28) gap of around 300 basis points towards your
target level. That feels quite large. Is there anything that you can do or are hoping for from the regulator to try and
get that target level down? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. I'll ask Ewen to answer both of those questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the NII guidance, a couple of things. I mean, you should assume that, yeah, we've got a bit of
[indiscernible] (00:57:40) in there when we're guiding to at least $37 billion. Secondly, I think, remember, as
interest rate continue to rise, deposit betas will continue to rise. So, if you don't get that final hedge on interest
rates at the back end, then we're already modeling very high deposit betas at that time. So, the implicit impact on
the net interest income is a lot lower than what you may think.
15


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
So, we've run various scenarios and are comfortable based on a range of scenarios at the moment that we'll be
able to deliver $37 billion, but obviously it's a very material change in rates. We will reassess that and we've given
you the interest rate sensitivity, so you can run your own numbers.
On capital, yeah, look. I think there is a debate at the back end of 2023 and 2024 whether we can adjust our core
Tier 1 ratio. If you think about where we've been in the past, we've been making a very big investment internally
into our stress testing capabilities, into our recovery and resolution capabilities, which you don't see from the
outside. We also didn't have the returns in the past, the combination of the returns that we had and that very high
payout ratio that we had in the past. We just didn't have the same capital flexibility that we expect to have from
2023 onwards.
So, I think it's important, before we engage the regulators in that discussion, that we get back within the range.
But I think once we're back in the range, there should be some model stability to adjust down where we're
targeting on core Tier 1. But I would say that's back end of 2023, 2024 for discussion.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gurpreet Singh Sahi Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC
Thanks for taking the question. This is Gurpreet with Goldman. Congratulations on a good set of numbers. I have
two quick questions, please. First is on the prime rate in Hong Kong and then the mortgage gap that should
effectively be hitting all the mortgage borrowers starting next month, if I'm not mistaken. So, what could be the
efforts to that prime minus and hence to lift the effective gap for the mortgage borrowers? And how much of that
can we do before we see kind of deposit migration as, Ewen, you have talked about and then we run into that
question of raising the prime interest rates? And then once they are raised, will it be symmetrical with the savings
deposit rate or does it do asymmetrical? That's the first question. Sorry for being a lengthy one on this one.
And then second is simple on the credit cost. So as of now, I see China CRE still contributing nearly 30% of the
total provisions. At some point during this year or early next year, it's going to roll off. I mean China is going to –
isn't go – we aren't going to book CRE losses till eternity, right? And so I still see the guidance on the second half
of 40 basis points versus first half 2020. So, how much of the typical hallmark HSBC conservatism goes into that?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll take that as a compliment, traditional HSBC conservatism. I think that's something good to be accused of. Let
me deal with the Chinese CRE and then I'll ask Ewen to deal with the prime rate and the mortgage cap. Listen,
the ECL charge in the first six months is a positive outcome and – but the economy is still uncertain. So, I think it
would be unwise of us at the half-year stage to start factoring in the first-half performance as a trend for the full
year and, therefore, it is appropriate to guide to a higher second half charge given the level of uncertainty.
And I think we'll update the Q3 and clearly we'll know the answer in Q4, but it'd be unwise to think that the first
half trend is something that can roll forward into the second half. Our expectation at the moment is the forward
economic guidance will probably continue to worsen and, therefore, there's more likely to be stage 1 and stage 2
16


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2022
provisions in the second half of the year rather than necessarily us having a line of sight to stage 3, so, if that
build of ECL in the second half I think is going to be more around stage 1 and stage 2 as economic forecasts
continue to deteriorate and forward economic guidance is factored in.
So, that would be the view on the ECL. But happy to be conservative at this stage. Ewen, do you want to cover
prime rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Are you sure you don't want to cover that, Noel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No, I don't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean just to add on ECLs, we haven't said they're going to be 40 basis points in the second half. We said that
they're trending towards a yearly average of 30 basis points. So, that would be the highest they – we would
expect them to be in the second half. On the prime rate, not for everyone in the room here in Hong Kong will –
understands this, but for everyone who's not in Hong Kong and – yeah, the mortgage market here is typically
priced of one-month HIBOR plus the spread.
The borrowers also have an option to shift from that rate to what's called the best lending rate minus margin.
Today, those two rates are broadly in line with each other. Maybe even, I would say, most of our mortgage
brokers tipping into the latter, i.e., the best lending rate minus margin provides a lower rate to customers than
one-month HIBOR plus the spread we're charging them. The – and that rate is set daily and calculated daily and
the customer doesn't need to do anything. It just happens automatically that they switch from one rate to the
other.
Today, about 12% of our portfolio is subject to the mortgage cap, but I would say that given movements in the last
month or so, that's likely to trend materially higher to most of the portfolio over the next couple of months. Look,
I'm clearly not going to sit here and give guidance on what we're going to do with the best lending rate.
Historically, going back, I think for 20 years, the best lending rate has moved in line with the best savings rate. So
we have seen slightly lower margins in the past but no discounts being applied to the base lending rate. That's
obviously one tool we have.
If we were to change the best lending rate and the best savings rate followed in tandem, that would be
economically worse for us given that we have a larger deposit surplus and would see a bigger hit on higher
savings rates than the benefit we'd get from raising the lending rate. But clearly this is all subject to competition
and we're not going to discuss it on a public call.

Ewen James Stevenson A

Hey, Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hi there. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first if you could clarify the $31 billion and the $37 billion net
interest income guidance that you gave, can you just provide a bit more detail on what you are assuming on the
[indiscernible] (01:05:30) you talked about [indiscernible] (01:05:35) rate hike cycles. So if you could just clarify
what [indiscernible] (01:05:41) you have assumed to get to that $31 billion and $37 billion?
And my second question is sort of the disconnect between average interest-earning asset and loan growth. If you
look at the quarter on constant currency basis, loans are up 1, average interest-earning asset is down 1, so what's
driven the disconnect? And given your guidance for next year of the mid-single-digit loan growth, do you think
though the average interest-earning assets will reconnect with the loan growth next year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the second one, Andy, it's just average interest-earning assets are not FX adjusted. So, if you talk to
our research team afterwards, they'll be able to give you a sort of FX-adjusted average interest-earning asset.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A

Yeah. Also, low – some lower liquidity balances in the quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On NII guidance, you know I hate giving NII guidance. So I thought I was doing well today to give it, but
we're not going to go on and get – go on and give you deposit beta assumptions as part of that. Look, we've said
through the cycle we expected to be 50 basis points. We've said that deposit betas so far I think have been in the
20s. So, you should assume that there's a material ramp-up in deposit betas as rates go higher from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q

growth?

Hi, Martin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes, good morning. First of all, [indiscernible] (01:07:32) comment on the good set of numbers today. I'm just
wondering, first question, on structural hedging and I'm just wondering if you [indiscernible] (01:07:43) change
towards deployment of some more structural hedging or maturity transformation or however you want to call it in
geographies outside of the UK in order to maybe transform some of the deposits into kind of more medium term
maturities and to stabilize NII [ph] moving forward (01:08:04) forward.
And can you just update us on where you are with structural hedging and if [indiscernible] (01:08:11) capacity to
do more? And secondly, you called out the stellar performance of the UK. I was just wondering if you could
provide a little bit more color on what's precisely driving that strength. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, on structural hedging, Martin, I mean, look, firstly, the nature of our book was – here in Hong Kong
where it's different – difficult to extend, if not impossible to extend duration. Given the nature of the deposit base
and the asset base here, we can't buy longevity in Hong Kong dollars. And secondly, on the asset side, the trade
book is very short-dated, too. So, we do typically have more interest rate sensitivity than most of our peers.
Having said that, we – relative to what we could do, we are structurally under hedged. We have, for example,
started to – as some of the hold to collect and sell portfolio is beginning to mature, we've materially increased the
hold to collect portfolio during the quarter, and you should expect that to continue. So I think we will slowly
increase the level of structural hedging overall in the bank over time to reduce some of the interest rate sensitivity.
But given the nature of the balance sheet, I think you should assume that we will continue to have higher interest
rate sensitivity than peers even after we've done that.
On the outperformance of the UK business, which I think was the second question, look, I mean I just think Ian
Stuart and team are doing a really, really good job at the moment. They've – are taking very assertive actions
against their cost structure. I think costs were down 8% Q2-on-Q2. We've always told you that we're structurally
underweight in some segments like mortgages. We had 7% mortgage growth year-on-year in Q2. The
Commercial business is going well at the moment in the UK post-Brexit.

We are the only bank in the UK of any size that can really deliver an international network to customers. And as
customers change the nature of their international businesses, we're ideally placed to service that. So, look, I –
and, obviously, credit conditions in the UK, at least for us, continue to remain relatively benign.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just another statistic on the UK, year-to-date, the UK business has helped more than 1,000 overseas customers
purchase or refinance properties in the UK in the first six months of this year. And then on the other side of the
equation, I'm really pleased to say that the UK business has offered great support. They've helped more than
5,000 Ukrainian settlers to the UK open a bank account with us.
So, I think what you're looking at is a broad base of activity. In the digital world, the UK has now onboarded
40,000 clients onto HSBC Kinetic, which is a fully mobile digital proposition for SMEs, full range of product suite
there, not just the account [ph] home (01:11:38) but cards, lending, overdraft, savings accounts. And they've
onboarded – 85% of those customers have been onboarded within 48 hours, and the customer satisfaction is
currently sitting at 92%.
So I think you've got a broad base of actions that Ian and the team have taken in the UK; costs, revenue
generation, products enhancements, digitization, the international clients and the domestic clients. And I think
there's a lot of good work being done there and it's starting to pay dividend.

Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Morning – morning, afternoon, everyone, and thanks for the questions. The first was just on capital actions
and if you could elaborate on what [indiscernible] (01:12:35) in the second half from those [ph] sort of early
revenue hit (01:12:37) [indiscernible] (01:12:39). And sort of what informs taking those actions now [indiscernible]
(01:12:42) to build the capital naturally and get back to [ph] target (01:12:45) a little bit more [indiscernible]
(01:12:46) especially given that the capital hit is in part rate-driven which is P&L beneficial in time, ultimately, net
positive?
Just wondered [indiscernible] (01:12:54) quickly do a buyback next year, [indiscernible] (01:12:58) dividends
[indiscernible] (01:12:59) or anything else. And the third question was on rate. Thanks for all the color with the

guidance [indiscernible] (01:13:05). I just wondered, given where the market implied path is now, where that – the
[ph] shift any further out (01:13:11), would you still see that as net beneficial to the bottom line given caps on
client, given deposit mix, given – with regard to the technical implications for impairments [ph] growth (01:13:24),
et cetera. So I just wondered how much incrementally beneficial you'd still see rate rises [indiscernible]
(01:13:30)? Thank you.

Yeah. Look, on capital actions that mainly benefit RWAs, they – it will have a – some but modest impact on the
P&L. But we do think, when we think about the balance of considerations of heading into probably tougher
economic conditions in 2023, the right thing for us to do is to accelerate our capital ratios to being back within
target. So, we're happy to accept some impact on income in order to achieve that. But we do think that the return
analysis that we're running on those incremental actions makes sense and we're not doing anything that goes into
what I'd describe as franchise impairment – impairing actions.
On NII, I think it is market dependent. So here in Hong Kong, there's probably very little benefit that we would
derive from interest rates going higher than what's implied in forward curves at the moment. But I think in other
markets, definitely, there would be value. And I still think that we're structurally geared to – if you think about the
last couple of years, in 2021, net interest income was slightly under $27 billion. So, over two years, we're
generating an extra $10 billion of net interest income which more than offsets any incremental ECL costs we
could see or higher costs because of inflationary issues.
So, I still think that there's some ways to run, even based on forward curves, before you start seeing impairments
materially tick up. I think the other thing that's important to remember, Guy, for us and it probably applies to other
banks, but our customer base on the retail side is mainly affluent. They've had their savings rates go up materially
during COVID so they're all sitting quite liquid with good cash reserves at the moment.
You've also – we've seen credit card spending pick up, but people are still mainly rolling their credit card
balances. So we don't have any particular credit – difficult credit exposure on the retail side that I would call out
with the customers sitting with good cash balances. And now on the mainstream corporate side, the global
corporate sector has effectively been deleveraging for 2.5 years. In most parts of the world, corporate loan growth
has been well below GDP – nominal GDP growth.
So, again, corporate balance sheets are unusually healthy for what would be at this point in a cycle facing a
downturn. Yeah, so for all those reasons, I think if interest rates went higher other than Hong Kong, I think we
would sort of view that as a positive for us.

Just checking, any further questions in Hong Kong? Appears to be none. So I think we have time for one more
question from the audio lines and then we'll hand back to Noel to sum up. So, last question from the audio lines,
please.

Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Thank you. Hi. Hi, everyone. [ph] It seems you're being so (01:17:20) charitable and you're giving specific
guidance on [indiscernible] (01:17:24) net interest income, costs, returns, I could possibly back out what you're
thinking on non-interest income, but just wondering if you could give us any color on what you're thinking in terms
of the main drivers and COVID restrictions, [indiscernible] (01:17:41), what's going on in capital markets, Chinese
GDP, all those things [ph] called but (01:17:45) seems to be the only missing piece of the P&L we don't have now.

Tom, you know how much Ewen likes giving guidance on NII. Now, you're asking him to give guidance on NFI as
well. It's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. Tom, if my Chief Accountant was here, we'd be running dangerously close to giving a profit forecast. But the
only thing I would say is when you run your calculations for 2023, do you think about all of the one-offs that we've
had this year, including the negative insurance MCU that won't repeat or shouldn't repeat next year, so – but I'm
not going to give you anything on NII forecast, but nice try.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think what we've all got to factor in to our future thinking is, take here in Hong Kong, there should at some point a
rebound in wealth management activity that would drive higher free income. There should be at some stage a
rebound in capital market activity that should drive higher fees for GB&M, but it's too early at the moment to
predict exactly how much of that will come back and when it will come back.

But you could argue, if you look at the P&L of the retail bank and the WPB for the first six months, they've got
revenue growth and what you've found is that the retail banking has driven strong growth from NII but has been
subdued on its fee income. And then if you can start to get the fee income coming back as economies reboot and
wealth management activity reestablishes itself, then you should start to see a growth in NII – in non-interest
income. But it's too early to predict when that will be and we're not going to give guidance on it.
