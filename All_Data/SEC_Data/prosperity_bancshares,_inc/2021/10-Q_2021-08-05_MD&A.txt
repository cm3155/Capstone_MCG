Therefore, the Company cautions against placing undue reliance on its forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of the Company&#8217;s balance sheets and statements of income. This section should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

OVERVIEW

Prosperity Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation (&#8220;Bancshares&#8221;), is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank (the &#8220;Bank,&#8221; and together with Bancshares, the &#8220;Company&#8221;). The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to businesses and consumers throughout Texas and Oklahoma. As of June 30, 2021, the Bank operated 274 full-service banking locations&#59; with 65 in the Houston area including The Woodlands&#59; 30 in the South Texas area including Corpus Christi and Victoria&#59; 64 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area&#59; 22 in the East Texas area&#59; 29 in the Central Texas area including Austin and San Antonio&#59; 34 in the West Texas area including Lubbock, Midland-Odessa and Abilene&#59; 16 in the Bryan/College Station area&#59; 6 in the Central Oklahoma area&#59; and 8 in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. The Company&#8217;s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas, and its telephone number is (281) 269-7199. The Company&#8217;s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com. Information contained on the Company&#8217;s website is not incorporated by reference into this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and is not part of this or any other report.

The Company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans, service charges and fees on customer accounts and income from investment in securities. The revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which 

&#160;

are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company&#8217;s largest source of revenue. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin. 

Three principal components of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy are internal growth, efficient operations and acquisitions, including strategic merger transactions. The Company focuses on continual internal growth. The Company maintains separate data with respect to each banking center&#8217;s net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth and loan growth for purposes of measuring its overall profitability. The Company also focuses on maintaining efficiency and stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has centralized many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan processing. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth and achieve necessary controls while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale. The Company also intends to continue to seek expansion opportunities. 

Total assets were $36.10 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $34.06 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.04 billion or 6.0%. Total loans were $19.25 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $20.25 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $995.2 million or 4.9%. Total deposits were $29.11 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $27.36 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.75 billion or 6.4%. Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $6.31 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $6.13 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $179.7 million or 2.9%.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. The Company&#8217;s accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity:

Business Combinations &#8212;Generally, acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805, Business Combinations . A business combination occurs when the Company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business. Business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash and/or common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. The results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated results from acquisition date, and prior periods are not restated. The fair value of acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding future credit losses and therefore no allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date. 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#8212; The allowance for credit losses is accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) methodology. CECL requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected . The allowance for credit losses is an allowance available for losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. All losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that such a loss is likely and can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. 

The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of two elements: (1) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans and PCD loans&#59; and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation, management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits&#59; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged off. Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. For further discussion of the 

&#160;

methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans, see &#8220;Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses &#8221; , &#8220;Financial Condition&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans&#8221; sections below. 

Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses &#8212; The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans, see &#8220;Financial Condition&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans&#8221; below. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s acquisition and loan accounting, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments &#8212;The Company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs include quoted active market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, Level 2 inputs are used. These inputs are based upon internally developed analytical tools that primarily use observable, market-based parameters. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity&#8217;s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC

The Company continues to monitor the latest developments regarding COVID-19. As of June 30, 2021, the states of Texas and Oklahoma have lifted their respective restrictions on all business and activities. However, as the number of cases attributable to the variants of COVID-19 increase, including the Delta variant, it is possible that some restrictions could be re-introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant economic uncertainties that have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s operating income, financial condition and cash flows. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results during 2021 cannot be reasonably or reliably estimated at this time.

Since the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program in 2020, the Company has obtained SBA approvals on approximately 18,700 loans totaling $2.036 billion and, as of June 30, 2021, had an outstanding balance of 7,770 loans totaling $780.0 million after remittance. 

Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has provided relief to its loan customers through loan extensions and deferrals. The Company&#8217;s troubled debt restructurings do not include loan modifications related to COVID-19. Beginning in mid-March of 2020, the Company began offering deferral and modification of principal and/or interest payments to selected borrowers on a case-by-case basis. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $210.4 million in outstanding loans subject to deferral and modification agreements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income available to common shareholders was $130.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 compared with $130.9 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $290 thousand or 0.2%. Net income per diluted common share was $1.41 for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 includes a tax benefit for a NOL of $20.1 million and merger related expenses of $7.5 million. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of 8.31% and 8.84%, annualized returns on average assets of 1.45% and 1.61% and efficiency ratios of 40.96% and 46.56% for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Because the ratio is a measure of revenues and expenses resulting from the Company&#8217;s lending activities and fee-based banking services, net gains and losses on the sale of assets are not included. Additionally, taxes are not part of this calculation.

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, net income available to common shareholders was $263.9 million compared with $261.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $2.2 million or 0.8%. Net income per diluted common share was $2.84 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $2.80 for the same period in 2020, an increase of 1.4%. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of 8.46% and 8.85%, annualized returns on average assets of 1.49% and 1.64% and efficiency ratios of 41.11% and 44.72% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

&#160;

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a &#8220;volume change.&#8221; It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a &#8220;rate change.&#8221;

For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2021

Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was $245.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $13.6 million or 5.2%, compared with $259.0 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average loan balance and average rate on loans and a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.

Interest income on loans was $216.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $26.0 million or 10.7%, compared with $242.8 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average loan balance and average rate on loans and a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.1 million.

Interest income on securities was $43.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $68 thousand or 0.2%, compared with $43.8 million for the same period in 2020. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities were $19.52 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $1.84 billion or 10.4%, compared with $17.68 billion for the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits partially offset by decreases in other borrowings and subordinated notes. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 3.11% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 58 basis points or 15.7% compared to 3.69% for the same period in 2020. The change was primarily due to a decrease in the average loan balance and average rate on loans, an increase in lower yielding securities, a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.1 million and higher cash balances due to excess liquidity, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021

Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was $500.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $15.0 million or 2.9%, compared with $515.0 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average rate on interest-earning assets and a decrease in loan discount accretion of $24.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.

Interest income on loans was $449.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $40.1 million or 8.2%, compared with $490.0 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in lower yielding loans and a decrease in loan discount accretion of $24.2 million. The Company had $25.2 million of total outstanding accretable discounts on purchased loans.

Interest income on securities was $82.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $9.7 million or 10.5%, compared with $92.1 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower average yields and higher net premium amortization offset by an increase in average securities balances.

Average interest-bearing liabilities were $19.23 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $1.55 billion or 8.8%, compared with $17.68 billion for the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits partially offset by decreases in other borrowings and subordinated notes. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 3.26% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decreased of 49 basis points or 13.1%, compared to 3.75% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in lower yielding loans, a decrease in loan discount accretion of $24.2 million, higher net premium amortization on securities and higher cash balances due to excess liquidity, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.

&#160;

&#160;

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of average balances, interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant rates. Except as indicated in the footnotes, no tax-equivalent adjustments were made and all average balances are daily average balances. Any nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Annualized and based on average balances on an actual 365-day or 366-day basis for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

(2) Yield is based on amortized cost and does not include any component of unrealized gains or losses.

(3) The net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

(4) In order to make pretax income and resultant yields on tax-exempt investments and loans comparable to those on taxable investments and loans, a tax-equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of 21%.

&#160;

The following table presents information regarding the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and changes in interest rates. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate.

Includes impact of purchase accounting adjustments. 

Provision for Credit Losses

Management actively monitors the Company&#8217;s asset quality and provides specific loss provisions when necessary. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income to bring the total allowance for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures to a level deemed appropriate by management of the Company based on such factors as historical lifetime credit loss experience, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral, the volume growth and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the loan portfolio through the internal loan review process and other relevant factors.

Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.

The Company had no provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and a $10.0 million provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The Company had no provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and a $10.0 million provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Net charge-offs were $4.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 compared with net charge-offs of $13.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2021 included $1.0 million related to resolved PCD loans. These PCD loans had specific reserves of $3.1 million, of which $1.0 million was allocated to the charge-offs and $2.1 million was moved to the general reserve. Further, an additional $1.4 million of specific reserves on resolved PCD loans without any related charge-offs was released to the general reserve. Net charge-offs were $13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $13.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $8.2 million related to resolved PCD loans. These PCD loans had specific reserves of $9.8 million, of which $7.7 million was allocated to the charge-offs and $2.1 million was moved to the general reserve. Further, an additional $5.6 million of specific reserves on resolved PCD loans without any related charge-offs was released to the general reserve. See &#8220;Financial Condition &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; below for more information. 

&#160;

Noninterest Income

The Company&#8217;s primary sources of recurring noninterest income are nonsufficient funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees, credit, debit and ATM card income, and service charges on deposit accounts. Additionally, the Company generates recurring noninterest income from its various additional products and services, including trust services, mortgage lending, brokerage and independent sales organization sponsorship operations. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 

Noninterest income totaled $35.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $25.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $9.9 million or 38.5%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in credit card, debit card and ATM card income, an increase in mortgage income, lower loss on write-down of assets and an increase in other noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $69.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $60.1 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $9.5 million or 15.8%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in credit card, debit card and ATM card income, an increase in mortgage income, lower net loss on write-downs of assets and an increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in nonsufficient funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense totaled $115.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 compared with $134.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $19.2 million or 14.3%, primarily due to decreases in merger related expenses, salaries and benefits and data processing as a result of efficiencies gained following the LegacyTexas Bank system conversion during the second quarter of 2020 and gains on sale of other real estate. Noninterest expense totaled $234.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $259.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $24.8 million or 9.6%. The change was primarily due to decreases in merger related expenses, data processing, net occupancy and equipment and other noninterest expense as a result of efficiencies gained following the LegacyTexas Bank system conversion during the second quarter of 2020 and gains on sale of other real estate.

Income Taxes 

The amount of federal and state income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of other nondeductible expenses. Income tax expense totaled $35.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $9.4 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $25.8 million or 275.5%. Income tax expense totaled $71.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with $44.2 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $27.2 million or 61.5%. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 includes a tax benefit for a NOL of $20.1 million generated as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act and merger related expenses of $7.5 million. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was 21.2% and 6.7%, respectively. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was 21.3% and 14.4%, respectively.

The CARES Act. The CARES Act permits a five-year carryback period for NOLs, which allowed the Company to generate an anticipated tax refund and income tax benefit resulting from the tax rate differential between the current statutory tax rate of 21% and the 35% statutory tax rate in prior years during the carryback period. Pursuant to this provision of the CARES Act, the Company recorded a federal current benefit for taxes on income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to the NOL generated in 2019 by LegacyTexas that were used to offset taxable income generated between 2014 and 2017 taxed at 35% resulting in a tax benefit of $20.1 million, which is included in provision for income taxes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. This caused a reduction in the effective tax rate during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. As a result of the NOL carryback, there was a reduction in the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets of $30.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

&#160;

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Loan Portfolio

The Company separates its loan portfolio into two general categories of loans: (1) &#8220;originated loans,&#8221; which are loans originated by Prosperity Bank and made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made, and (2) &#8220;acquired loans,&#8221; which are loans acquired in a business combination and preliminarily recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination are referred to as &#8220;re-underwritten acquired loans.&#8221; If a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the Company with a new credit analysis, the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan. For example, acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan number and categorized as an originated loan. Acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as &#8220;fair-valued acquired loans.&#8221; All fair-valued acquired loans are further categorized into purchased credit-deteriorated loans (&#8220;PCD loans&#8221;) and &#8220;Non-PCD loans.&#8221; Acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date when compared to the origination date are classified as PCD loans.

The following tables summarize the Company&#8217;s originated and acquired loan portfolios broken out into originated loans, re-underwritten acquired loans, Non-PCD loans and PCD loans, as of the dates indicated.

At June 30, 2021, total loans were $19.25 billion, a decrease of $995.2 million or 4.9%, compared with $20.25 billion at December 31, 2020. Loans at June 30, 2021 included $9.1 million of loans held for sale and $2.10 billion of Warehouse Purchase Program loans compared with $46.8 million of loans held for sale and $2.84 billion of Warehouse Purchase Program loans at December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, loans represented 53.3% of total assets compared with 59.4% of total assets at December 31, 2020.

The loan portfolio consists of various types of loans categorized by major type as follows:

(i) Commercial and Industrial Loans. In nearly all cases, the Company&#8217;s commercial loans are made in the Company&#8217;s market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to service the debt from income. Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. As a general practice, term loans are secured by any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower. Both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal. In general, commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans. 

Included in commercial and industrial loans are (1) commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven, developed and producing reserves and (2) commitments to service, equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally re-determined semi-annually using reserve studies prepared by a third-party or the Company&#8217;s oil and gas engineer. Accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically re-determined monthly. Funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base. As of June 30, 2021, oil and gas loans totaled $501.8 million (net of discount and excluding PPP loans totaling $92.3 million) or 2.6% of total loans, compared with total oil and gas loans of $512.7 million (net of discount and excluding PPP loans totaling $88.7 million) or 2.5% of total loans as of December 31, 2020. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, the Company had total unfunded commitments to oil and gas companies of $298.4 million compared with total unfunded commitments to oil and gas companies of $243.2 million as of December 31, 2020. Total unfunded commitments to producers include letters of credit issued in lieu of oil well plugging bonds.

(ii) Commercial Real Estate. The Company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate. The Company&#8217;s commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate, typically have variable interest rates (or five year or less fixed rates) and amortize over a 15- to 25-year period. Payments on loans secured by nonowner-occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. The Company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property&#8217;s operating history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition, in connection with underwriting these loans. The underwriting analysis also includes credit verification, analysis of global cash flow, appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor. Loans to hotels and restaurants are included in commercial real estate loans. As of June 30, 2021, loans to hotels totaled $394.2 million (excluding PPP loans totaling $10.6 million) or 2.0% of total loans, compared to $393.8 million (excluding PPP loans totaling $6.5 million) or 1.9% of total loans at December 31, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, loans to restaurants totaled $201.9 million (excluding PPP loans totaling $92.1 million) or 1.0% of total loans, compared to $214.7 million (excluding PPP loans totaling $83.6 million) or 1.1% of total loans at December 31, 2020. 

(iii) 1-4 Family Residential Loans. The Company&#8217;s lending activities also include the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans) collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied residential properties located in the Company&#8217;s market areas. The Company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to 30 years. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 89% of appraised value. The Company requires mortgage title insurance, as well as hazard, wind and/or flood insurance as appropriate. The Company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market. By doing so, the Company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with non-payments on such loans. The Company&#8217;s mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over 30 years, including FHA and VA loans, which are sold to secondary market investors. 

(iv) Construction, Land Development and Other Land Loans. The Company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties. Construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates. The Company conducts periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on 

&#160;

these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the Company&#8217;s construction lending activities, with heightened analysis of construction and/or development costs. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Although the Company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending, these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above. 

(v) Warehouse Purchase Program . The Warehouse Purchase Program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators (&#8220;Clients&#8221;) to close 1-4 family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors. The Company's Clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each Client&#8217;s business model over the long term. The Clients are located across the U.S. and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail and/or wholesale business models using underwriting standards as required by United States government-sponsored enterprise agencies such as Fannie Mae, private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold and/or mortgage insurers. 

Although not subject to any legally binding commitment, when the Company makes a purchase decision, it acquires a 100% participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its Clients. Individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the Company&#8217;s portfolio only for a short duration, averaging less than 30 days. When instructed by a Client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor, the Company delivers the note to the investor that pays the Company, which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the Client. 

(vi) Agriculture Loans. The Company provides agriculture loans for short-term livestock and crop production, including rice, cotton, milo and corn, farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing. The Company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability, level of experience in their particular industry segment, overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry. Because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature, the Company routinely makes on-site visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks. 

(vii) Consumer Loans. Consumer loans made by the Company include direct &#8220;A&#8221;-credit automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 180 months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Generally, consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, personal bankruptcy or death. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 

The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition. Nonperforming assets do not include PCD loans unless the loan has deteriorated since the acquisition date. PCD loans are reported as nonperforming assets when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified.

The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases, unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral 

&#160;

fully supports the carrying value of the loan. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower. 

Nonperforming assets decreased $25.9 million, or 43.5%, to $33.7 million at June 30, 2021 compared with $59.6 million at December 31, 2020, of which $7.8 million and $18.7 million, respectively, were attributable to acquired loans. The decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to a $14.3 million decrease in nonaccrual loans primarily in the commercial and industrial and 1-4 family residential portfolios as well as a $10.4 million decrease in other real estate primarily resulting from the sale of two 1-4 family residential properties.

The following tables present information regarding nonperforming assets differentiated among originated loans, re-underwritten acquired loans, Non-PCD loans and PCD loans, as of the dates indicated:

There were no nonperforming or troubled debt restructurings of Warehouse Purchase Program loans or Warehouse Purchase Program lines of credit for the periods presented. 

Nonperforming assets were 0.17% of total loans and other real estate at June 30, 2021 and 0.29% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 912.0% at June 30, 2021 and 646.6% at December 31, 2020. 

&#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

The allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses on loans which it believes is adequate as of June 30, 2021 for estimated losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is affected by the following: (1) charge-offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance, (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance, and (4) provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or the borrower&#8217;s performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.

The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on expected lifetime losses on specifically identified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.

In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan. The specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below.

In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions, other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors. Historical lifetime loan loss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool (&#8220;cumulative loss rate&#8221;) methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime loan loss experience are made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well as changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to economic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. The Company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance.

A change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors, most notably (1) specific reserves identified for impaired loans, (2) historical lifetime credit loss information, (3) changes in current and forecasted environmental factors and (4) growth in the balance of loans.

Changes in the Company&#8217;s asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways. Specific reserves that are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Historical lifetime credit losses, on the other hand, are based on an open-pool (&#8220;cumulative loss rate&#8221;) methodology, which is then applied to estimate lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio. A deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical lifetime loss rate to be applied in future periods, just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical lifetime loss rate.

The allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include Company-specific risk indicators and general economic conditions, both of which are constantly changing. The Company evaluates the economic and portfolio-specific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance. The factors include current economic metrics, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic metrics, business conditions, delinquency trends, credit concentrations, nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical lifetime loss experience. Management&#8217;s assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the loss rate adjustment associated with such factors. Based on the Company&#8217;s actual historical lifetime loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfolio-specific factors at the time the losses occurred, 

&#160;

management is able to identify the probable level of lifetime losses as of the date of measurement. The correlation of historical loss experience with current and forecasted economic conditions provides an estimate of lifetime losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and lifetime historical losses. Additionally, the Company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision. 

Utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves, historical loss experience and a qualitative component, management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full lifetime loss.

The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. These fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof. 

Non-PCD loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered non-impaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance. Non-PCD loans that have become impaired subsequent to acquisition are assessed for the specific valuation allowance. 

Non-PCD loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which, when identified, is added to the allowance for credit losses. The Company reviews impaired Non-PCD loans on a loan-by-loan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors: expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Because essentially all of the Company&#8217;s impaired Non-PCD loans have been collateral-dependent, the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the Non-PCD loan with the recorded investment in such loan. In the future, the Company will continue to analyze impaired Non-PCD loans on a loan-by-loan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

PCD loans are individually monitored on a quarterly basis to assess for changes in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition. If a deterioration in cash flows is identified, an additional provision for credit losses is made. PCD loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, which were based on expected cash flows and included estimates of expected future credit losses. The Company&#8217;s estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the Company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date. If the Company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date, the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; above for more information. 

As described in the section captioned &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; above, the Company&#8217;s determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The Company&#8217;s analysis of qualitative, or environmental, factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics, in combination with the quantitative historical lifetime loss information and specific reserves, provides the Company with an estimate of lifetime losses. The allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology, as well as the estimated lifetime losses associated with those loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans as of June 30, 2021 totaled $302.9 million or 1.57% of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts, a decrease of $13.2 million or 4.2% compared to the allowance for credit losses on loans totaling $316.1 million or 1.56% of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts, as of December 31, 2020. Net charge-offs were $4.3 million and $13.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2021 included $1.0 million related to resolved PCD loans. These PCD loans had specific reserves of $3.1 million, of which $1.0 million was allocated to the charge-offs and $2.1 million was moved to the general reserve. Additionally, $1.4 million of specific reserves on resolved PCD loans was released to the general reserve without taking any charge-off. Net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $8.2 million related to PCD loans. These PCD loans had specific reserves of $9.8 million, of which $7.7 million was allocated to the charge-offs and $2.1 million was moved to the general reserve. Further, an additional $5.6 million of specific reserves on resolved PCD loans without any related charge-offs was released to the general reserve. As of June 30, 2021, the Company also had PPP loans totaling $780.0 million, which are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and do not carry an allowance.

&#160;

The following tables present, as of and for the periods indicated, information regarding the allowance for credit losses on loans differentiated between originated loans and acquired loans. Reported net charge-offs may include those from Non- PCD loans and PCD loans, but only if the total charge-off required is greater than the remaining discount.

Loans outstanding as of a percentage of total loans, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans.

The allowance for credit losses totaled $302.9 million at June 30, 2021 and $316.1 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses totaled 1.57% of total loans at June 30, 2021 and 1.56% of total loans at December 31, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, $171.4 million of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to originated loans, an increase of $20.8 million or 13.8% compared with $150.6 million of the allowance at December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, $39.7 million of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to re-underwritten acquired loans compared with $42.6 million of the allowance at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.0 million or 7.0%. At June 30, 2021, $47.5 million of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to Non-PCD loans compared with $63.1 million of the allowance at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $15.6 million or 24.7%. At June 30, 2021, $44.3 million of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to PCD loans compared with $59.8 million of the allowance at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $15.4 million or 25.8%. 

At June 30, 2021, the Company had $25.2 million of total outstanding accretable discounts on Non-PCD loans and PCD loans.

The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans at June 30, 2021 is adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses that may be realized from the loan portfolio as of such date. Nevertheless, the Company could sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at June 30, 2021.

&#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 

The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, except when an obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance is adjusted by provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance or provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on the commitments expected to fund. The estimate of commitments expected to fund is affected by historical analysis looking at utilization rates. The expected credit loss rates applied to the commitments expected to fund are affected by the general valuation allowance utilized for outstanding balances with the same underlying assumptions and drivers. As of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $29.9 million in allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a separate line item on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. 

Securities

The carrying cost of securities totaled $11.92 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $8.54 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.38 billion or 39.5%. At June 30, 2021, securities represented 33.0% of total assets compared with 25.1% of total assets at December 31, 2020.

The investment securities portfolio is measured for expected credit losses by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate expected credit losses methodology. Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for expected credit losses under FASB ASC 326, &#8220; Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses .&#8221;

&#160;

Available for sale securities . For available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the amount of the expected credit losses recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell 

&#160;

the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the expected credit losses will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the expected credit losses will be separated into the amount representing the credit-related portion of the impairment loss (&#8220;credit loss&#8221;) and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss (&#8220;noncredit portion&#8221;). The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis , and such difference is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the expected credit losses recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2021, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost. In addition, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to changes in market interest rates and spread relationships since the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2021, management believes that there is no potential for credit losses on available for sale securities.

&#160;

Held to maturity securities . The Company&#8217;s held to maturity investments include mortgage-related bonds issued by either the Government National Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;), Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;). Ginnie Mae issued securities are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued securities are fully guaranteed by those respective United States government-sponsored agencies, and conditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The Company&#8217;s held to maturity securities also include taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities issued primarily by school districts, utility districts and municipalities located in Texas. The Company&#8217;s investment in municipal securities is exposed to credit risk. The securities are highly rated by major rating agencies and regularly reviewed by management. A significant portion are guaranteed or insured by either the Texas Permanent School Fund, Assured Guaranty or Build America Mutual. As of June 30, 2021, the Company&#8217;s municipal securities represent 1.2% of the securities portfolio. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2021, management believes that there is no potential for material credit losses on held to maturity securities.

FHLB advances and long-term notes payable &#8212; The Company has an available line of credit with the FHLB of Dallas, which allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. The Company&#8217;s FHLB advances are typically considered short-term borrowings and are used to manage liquidity as needed. Maturing advances are replaced by drawing on available cash, making additional borrowings or through increased customer deposits. At June 30, 2021, the Company had total funds of $12.91 billion available under this line. At June 30, 2021 and at December 31, 2020, the Company had no FHLB advances or long-term notes payable balances. 

Securities sold under repurchase agreements &#8212; At June 30, 2021, the Company had $433.1 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements with banking customers compared with $389.6 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $43.5 million or 11.2%. Repurchase agreements are generally settled on the following business day&#59; however, approximately $5.4 million of the repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2021 have maturity dates ranging from 6 to 24 months. All securities sold under repurchase agreements are collateralized by certain pledged securities. 

Liquidity

Liquidity involves the Company&#8217;s ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the Company on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. The Company&#8217;s largest source of funds is deposits and its largest use of funds is loans. The Company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the future. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, the Company does not generally rely on this external funding source. The cash and federal funds sold position, supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios, has generally created an adequate liquidity position.

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding $4.08 billion in commitments to extend credit, $88.6 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit, $29.9 million in allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures and $1.36 billion in commitments associated with unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

The Company has no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature.

Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.06 billion compared with $1.34 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $283.4 million or 21.1%. The decrease was primarily due to the purchases of securities and payment of cash dividends of $91.1 million, partially offset by the increase in deposits and net cash provided by operating activities of $439.2 million. 

Share Repurchases

On January 26, 2021, Bancshares announced a stock repurchase program under which Bancshares could repurchase up to 5%, or approximately 4.65 million shares, of Bancshares&#8217; outstanding common stock over a one-year period expiring on January 26, 2022, at the discretion of management. Under the stock repurchase program, Bancshares may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions. Repurchases under this program may also be made in transactions outside the safe harbor during a pending merger, acquisition or similar transaction. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. Shares of stock repurchased are held as authorized but unissued shares. Bancshares is not obligated to purchase any particular number of shares, and Bancshares may suspend, modify or terminate the program at any time and for any reason without prior notice. No repurchases were made during the second quarter of 2021 or during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

&#160;

Leases 

The Company&#8217;s leases relate primarily to operating leases for office space and banking centers. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The Company&#8217;s leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 17 years, which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain for the Company to exercise that option. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental collateralized borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. Short-term leases and leases with variable lease costs are immaterial, and the Company has one sublease arrangement. Sublease income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was $800 thousand and $1.5 million, respectively, and the Company had no sublease income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities were approximately $52.5 million. ROU assets and lease liabilities were classified as other assets and other liabilities, respectively.

As of June 30, 2021, the weighted average of remaining lease terms of the Company&#8217;s operating leases was 6.8 years. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities as of June 30, 2021 for the Company&#8217;s operating leases was 2.25%. Cash paid for the Company&#8217;s operating leases for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $2.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Cash paid for the Company&#8217;s operating leases for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $6.4 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The Company obtained $667 thousand in ROU assets in exchange for lease liabilities for two operating leases during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The Company&#8217;s future undiscounted cash payments associated with its operating leases as of June 30, 2021 are summarized below (dollars in thousands).

Off-Balance Sheet Items

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company&#8217;s commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit, unused capacity of Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of June 30, 2021 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, unused capacity of Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $6.31 billion at June 30, 2021 compared with $6.13 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $179.7 million or 2.9%. The increase was primarily the result of net income of $263.9 million partially offset by dividend payments of $91.1 million.

The Basel III Capital Rules adopted by the federal regulatory authorities in 2013 substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions. The Basel III Capital Rules require a capital conservation buffer with respect to each of the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% was fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations that implement CECL in 2020 to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years. This two-year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available. The Company has elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule, which will largely delay the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital for the next two years, after which the effects will be phased in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period include both the initial impact of the Company&#8217;s adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ending December 31, 2021.

Financial institutions are categorized by the FDIC based on minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of June 30, 2021, the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios were above the levels required for the Bank to be designated as &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221;

The following table provides a comparison of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s risk-weighted and leverage capital ratios to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards as of June 30, 2021:
