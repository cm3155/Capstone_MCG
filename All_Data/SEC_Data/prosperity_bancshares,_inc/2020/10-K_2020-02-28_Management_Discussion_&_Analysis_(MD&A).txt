A forward-looking statement may include a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statement. The Company believes it has chosen these assumptions or bases in good faith and that they are reasonable. However, the Company cautions that assumptions or bases almost always vary from actual results, and the differences between assumptions or bases and actual results can be material. Therefore, the Company cautions against placing undue reliance on its forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of the Company&#8217;s balance sheets and statements of income. This section should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K.

Overview

The Company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans, service charges and fees on customer accounts and income from investment in securities. The Company also earns revenues from various additional products and services it provides, including trust services, mortgage lending, brokerage, credit card and independent sales organization sponsorship operations. The Company&#8217;s revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company&#8217;s largest source of revenue. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin.

Three principal components of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy are internal growth, efficient operations and acquisitions, including strategic merger transactions. The Company focuses on continual internal growth. Each banking center is operated as a separate profit center, maintaining separate data with respect to its net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth, loan growth and overall profitability. The Company also focuses on maintaining efficiency and stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has centralized many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan and deposit processing. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale. The Company also intends to continue to seek expansion opportunities. 

Net income was $332.6 million, $321.8 million and $272.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $4.52, $4.61 and $3.92, respectively, for these same periods. The change in net income during 2019 was principally due to an increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense and merger related expenses of $46.4 million. The change in net income during 2018 was principally due to lower corporate tax rates and an 

&#160;

increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The Company posted returns on average assets of 1.38% , 1.42% and 1.22% and returns on average common equity of 7.46% , 8.15% and 7.26% for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio was 48.25% in 2019 , 43.71% in 2018 and 42.76% in 2017 . The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense (excluding credit loss provisions) by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Because the ratio is a measure of revenues and expenses resulting from the Company&#8217;s lending activities and fee-based banking services, net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities are not included. Additionally, taxes are not part of this calculation. 

Total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $32.19 billion and $22.69 billion, respectively. Total deposits were $24.20 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.94 billion or 40.2% compared with $17.26 billion at December 31, 2018. Total loans were $18.85 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $8.48 billion or 81.7% compared with $10.37 billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $55.7 million in nonperforming loans, and its allowance for credit losses was $87.5 million compared with $17.2 million in nonperforming loans and an allowance for credit losses of $86.4 million at December 31, 2018. Shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.97 billion and $4.05 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Recent Acquisition

&#160;

Merger with LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. &#8212; On November 1, 2019, LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. (&#8220;LegacyTexas&#8221;), merged with Prosperity Bancshares and LegacyTexas Bank merged with Prosperity Bank (collectively, the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). LegacyTexas was headquartered in Plano, Texas and operated 42 locations in 19 North Texas cities in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth area. As of September 30, 2019, LegacyTexas, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $10.5 billion, total gross loans of $9.1 billion, total deposits of $6.5 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of $1.2 billion. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Prosperity issued 26,228,148 shares of Prosperity common stock with a closing price of $69.02 per share plus $318.0 million in cash, made up of $308.6 million in cash and $9.4 million cash in taxes withheld, for all outstanding shares of LegacyTexas. This resulted in goodwill of $1.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, Prosperity recognized $60.1 million of core deposit intangibles as of December 31, 2019. The goodwill balance as of December 31, 2019 does not include all subsequent fair value adjustments that are still being finalized.

&#160;

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. The Company&#8217;s accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, appearing elsewhere is this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity:

Business Combinations &#8212; Generally, acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805, Business Combinations. A business combination occurs when the Company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business. Business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash and/or common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. The results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated results from acquisition date, and prior periods are not restated. The fair value of acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding future credit losses and therefore no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date. 

Allowance for Credit Losses&#8212; The allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of two elements: (1) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans&#59; and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation, management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits&#59; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in 

&#160;

management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged off. Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, see &#8220;Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses &#8221; , &#8220;Financial Condition&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; sections below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses&#8212; The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. No allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date, as the fair value of the acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. These fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof. 

At period-end after acquisition, the fair-valued acquired loans from each acquisition are reassessed to determine whether an addition to the allowance for credit losses is appropriate due to further credit quality deterioration. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans, see &#8220;Financial Condition&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; below. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s acquisition and loan accounting, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8212; Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. Under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 350-20, &#8220;Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other&#8212;Goodwill,&#8221; companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining the need to perform step one of the annual test for goodwill impairment. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment described in the following paragraph for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The Company currently utilizes a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis. 

If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. The two-step process begins with an estimation of the fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting unit compared with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment.

The Company had no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at December 31, 2019. Core deposit intangible assets that are subject to amortization are being amortized on a non-pro rata basis over the years expected to be benefited, which the Company believes is between ten and fifteen years. These core deposit intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value. Based on the Company&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, management does not believe any of its goodwill is impaired as of December 31, 2019, because the fair value of the Company&#8217;s equity exceeded its carrying value. While the Company believes no impairment existed at December 31, 2019, under accounting standards applicable at that date, different conditions or assumptions, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company&#8217;s impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations.

Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired Securities&#8212; When the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost, and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair market value is below amortized cost, additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists. Available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. Often, the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing, making estimates of fair value subject to judgment. If actual information or conditions are different than estimated, the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated, which could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments&#8212; The Company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs include quoted active market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, Level 2 inputs are used. These 

&#160;

inputs are based upon internally developed analytical tools that primarily use observable, market-based parameters. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity&#8217;s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and made widespread changes to the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018. Under ASC Topic 740 &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; the Company was required to recalculate its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on these assets and liabilities. The recalculation resulted in a one-time non-cash charge of $1.4 million recorded to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income

The Company&#8217;s operating results depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including securities and loans, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. Interest rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. The Company&#8217;s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a &#8220;volume change.&#8221; It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a &#8220;rate change.&#8221;

&#160;

2019 versus 2018 . Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for 2019 was $695.8 million compared with $629.6 million for 2018, an increase of $66.2 million or 10.5%. This change was primarily due to the increase in loan discount accretion of $14.136 million related to the Merger. Interest income was $832.9 million in 2019, an increase of $105.7 million or 14.5% compared with 2018. Interest income on loans was $621.4 million for 2019, an increase of $117.5 million or 23.3% compared with 2018, which was primarily due to the increase in loan discount accretion of $14.1 million. The Company had $277.5 million of total outstanding discounts on purchased loans, of which $145.8 million was accretable at December 31, 2019. Interest income on securities was $209.8 million during 2019, a decrease of $12.1 million or 5.5% compared with 2018 due primarily to a decrease in the securities balance, partially offset by higher yields. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $528.5 million or 4.1% during 2019 compared with 2018. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.75% to 1.02% during the same time period, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $39.6 million. The total cost of funds increased to 0.70% during 2019 from 0.52% during 2018. 

Net interest margin, defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, was 3.32% on a tax equivalent basis for 2019, an increase of 14 basis points compared with 3.18% for 2018.

2018 versus 2017 . Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for 2018 was $629.6 million compared with $616.9 million for 2017, an increase of $12.7 million or 2.1%. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher yields on interest-earning assets and an increase in average loans, partially offset by higher rates on deposits and other borrowings. Additionally, net interest income was impacted by a decrease in loan discount accretion. Interest income was $727.2 million in 2018, an increase of $49.9 million or 7.4% compared with 2017. Interest income on loans was $504.0 million for 2018, an increase of $35.6 million or 7.6% compared with 2017. This was primarily due to higher loan yields and an increase in average loans of $319.4 million or 3.3%, partially offset by a decrease in loan discount accretion of $8.0 million. The Company had $17.7 million of total outstanding discounts on purchased loans, of which $16.4 million was accretable at December 31, 2018. Interest income on securities was $221.9 million during 2018, an increase of $13.7 million or 6.6% compared with 2017 due primarily to higher yields on securities. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $194.0 million or 1.5% during 2018 compared with 2017. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.46% to 0.75% during the same time period, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $37.1 million. The total cost of funds increased to 0.52% during 2018 from 0.33% during 2017. 

Net interest margin, defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets was 3.18% on a tax equivalent basis for 2018, a decrease of 1 basis point compared with 3.19% for 2017.

&#160;

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of average balances, interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. Except as indicated in the footnotes, no tax-equivalent adjustments were made and all average balances are daily average balances. Any nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

(1) The average outstanding balance includes two months of LegacyTexas average balances. 

(2) The net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

(3) In order to make pretax income and resultant yields on tax-exempt investments and loans comparable to those on taxable investments and loans, a tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and 35% for year ended December 31, 2017 and other applicable effective tax rates.

&#160;

The following table presents information regarding the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and changes in interest rates. Changes in interest income and interest expense related to purchase accounting adjustments are allocated to rate. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate.

Provision for Credit Losses

The Company&#8217;s provision for credit losses is established through charges to income in the form of the provision in order to bring the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under &#8220;Financial Condition&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses.&#8221; The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 was $87.5 million, representing 0.46% of total loans and 0.51% of total loans, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, as of such date. Acquired loans were recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation methodology that considers, among other things, interest rates, projected default rates, loss given defaults and recovery rates, with no carryover of any existing allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $4.3 million, $16.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $3.3 million, $14.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.

Noninterest Income

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s primary sources of recurring noninterest income are nonsufficient funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees, credit, debit and ATM card income, and service charges on deposit accounts. Additionally, the Company generates recurring noninterest income from its various additional products and services, including trust services, mortgage lending, brokerage and independent sales organization sponsorship operations. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income totaled $124.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million or 7.1% compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to two months of fees, service charges and mortgage income from LegacyTexas.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income totaled $116.0 million, a decrease of $621 thousand or 0.5% compared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the gain on sale of securities during 2017, partially offset by a lower net loss on sale of assets during 2018. 

&#160;

Salaries and Employee Benefits . Salaries and employee benefits were $226.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $18.8 million or 9.1% compared with 2018. This change was primarily due to additional expenses related to two months of LegacyTexas salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits were $207.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15.1 million or 7.9% compared with 2017. This change was primarily due to an increase in compensation for all associates following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The number of full-time equivalent associates employed by the Company were 3,901, 3,036 and 3,017 at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2019 include $10.6 million in stock&#8209;based compensation expense compared with $10.5 million and $6.9 million recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

&#160;

This decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC temporary surcharge in 2018. Regulatory assessments and FDIC insurance assessments were $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.1 million or 7.3%, compared with $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC temporary surcharge imposed on large banks by the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act. 

Core Deposit Intangibles Amortization . Core deposit intangibles (&#8220;CDI&#8221;) amortization was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $578 thousand or 9.7% compared with $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Merger Related Expenses . Merger related expenses were $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the Merger that was completed on November 1, 2019. 

Efficiency Ratio

The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in management&#8217;s internal evaluation of the Company and is not calculated based on GAAP. A GAAP-based efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense, excluding credit loss provisions, by net interest income plus total noninterest income, as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio, as calculated and used by the Company, excludes from noninterest income the net gains and losses on the sale of securities and assets, which can vary widely from period to period. Taxes are not included in either calculation. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio calculated pursuant to GAAP was 48.36% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 43.75% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 42.69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of securities and assets, was 48.25% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 43.71% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 42.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Income Taxes

The amount of federal and state income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of other nondeductible expenses. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, the Company recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $1.4 million to income tax expense to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. 

Income tax expense was $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.4 million or 6.7% compared with $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to two months of operations related to the LegacyTexas banking centers and lending function. Income tax expense was $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $52.7 million or 39.3% compared with $133.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in corporate tax rates by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was 20.7%, 20.2% and 33.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. 

&#160;

statutory rate of 21% during 201 9 and 2018 and 35% during 2017 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans and securities. 

Impact of Inflation

The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.

Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company&#8217;s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, noninterest expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.

Financial Condition

Loan Portfolio

At December 31, 2019, total loans were $18.85 billion, an increase of $8.48 billion or 81.7%, compared with $10.37 billion at December 31, 2018.

Commercial real estate loans include approximately $1.91 billion, $1.52 billion, $1.52 billion, $1.46 billion and $1.42 billion of owner-occupied loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Includes fair value discounts on acquired loans of $277.5 million, $17.7 million, $34.7 million, $59.4 million and $94.7 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The Company separates its loan portfolio into two general categories of loans: (1) loans originated by Prosperity Bank and made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made are ref erred to as &#8220;originated loans&#8221; and (2) &#8220;acquired loans,&#8221; which are loans acquired in a business combination. Those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination, thereby subjecting them to the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses methodology, are referred to as &#8220;re-underwritten acquired loans.&#8221; If a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the Company with a new credit analysis, the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan. For example, acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan nu mber and categorized as an originated loan. Acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as &#8220;fair-valued acquired loans.&#8221; All fair-valued acquired loans are further categorized into &#8220;Non-PCI loans&#8221; an d &#8220;PCI loans&#8221; (purchased credit- impaired loans). Acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition for which it is probable that the Company would not be able to collect all contractual amounts due are PCI loans. 

The following tables summarize the Company&#8217;s originated and acquired loan portfolios broken out into originated loans, re-underwritten acquired loans, Non-PCI loans and PCI loans as of the dates indicated.

The Company offers a broad range of short to medium-term commercial loans, primarily collateralized, to businesses for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisitions of real estate and improvements) and the purchase of equipment and machinery. Historically, the Company has originated loans for its own account, including loans in the 1-4 family residential category, and has not securitized its loans. However, the Company does originate longer-term residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure. 

Loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships over $1.0 million and below $5.0 million are evaluated and acted upon on a daily basis by two of the company-wide loan concurrence officers. Loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships above $5.0 million are evaluated and acted upon by an officers&#8217; loan committee that meets weekly. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans . In nearly all cases, the Company&#8217;s commercial loans are made in the Company&#8217;s market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to service the debt from income. Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. As a general practice, term loans are secured by any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower. Both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal. In general, commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans. 

Included in commercial loans are (1) commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven, developed and producing reserves and (2) commitments to service, equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally re-determined semi-annually using reserve studies prepared by a third-party or the Company&#8217;s oil and gas engineer. Accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically re-determined monthly. Funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $401.5 million in funded commitments outstanding to oil and gas production companies and $203.1 million in unfunded commitments, for a total of $604.6 million. This compares with funded commitments to oil and gas production companies of $114.2 million and $128.6 million in unfunded commitments, for a total of $242.8 million as of December 31, 2018. Total unfunded commitments to producers include letters of credit issued in lieu of oil well plugging bonds. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding $296.8 million in funded commitments to service companies and $139.1 million in unfunded commitments for a total of $435.9 million. This compares with funded commitments to service companies of $258.3 million and $109.9 million in unfunded commitments, for a total of $368.2 million as of December 31, 2018.

Commercial Real Estate . The Company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate. The Company&#8217;s commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate, typically have variable interest rates (or five year or less fixed rates) and amortize over a 15- to 25-year period. Payments on loans secured by nonowner-occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. The Company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property&#8217;s operating history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition, in connection with underwriting these loans. The underwriting analysis also includes credit verification, analysis of global cash flow, appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor. 

1-4 Family Residential Loans . The Company&#8217;s lending activities also include the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans) collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied residential properties located in the Company&#8217;s market areas. The Company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to 30 years. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 89% of appraised value. The Company requires mortgage title insurance, as well as hazard, wind and/or flood insurance as appropriate. The Company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market. By doing so, the Company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with non-payments on such loans. The Company&#8217;s mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over 30 years, including FHA and VA loans, which are sold to secondary market investors. 

&#160;

Construction, Land Development and Other Land Loans . The Company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties. Construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates. The Company conducts periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the Company&#8217;s construction lending activities, with heightened analysis of construction and/or development costs. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Although the Company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending, these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above. 

Warehouse Purchase Program. The Company acquired the Warehouse Purchase Program as part of the merger with LegacyTexas. The Warehouse Purchase Program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators (&#8220;Clients&#8221;) to close 1-4 family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors. The Company's Clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each Client&#8217;s business model over the long term. The Clients, located across the U.S., and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail and/or wholesale business models and use underwriting standards consistent with the United States government-sponsored enterprises, &#8220;Agencies&#8221; such as Fannie Mae, the private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold and the mortgage insurers. 

At December 31, 2019, the Bank had 37 mortgage banking company customers with aggregate uncommitted facilities (&#8220;Facilities&#8221;) of $2.21 billion and an actual aggregate outstanding balance of $1.55 billion&#59; and the Clients&#8217; individual Facilities ranged in size from $2.0 million to $150.0 million. A Facility is often supported by a payment guaranty of the Client&#8217;s owners holding significant ownership positions, along with non-interest-bearing compensating balance deposits in line with the Facility amount. Typical covenants include minimum tangible net worth, maximum leverage and minimum liquidity. As loans age, the Company requires loan curtailments to reduce the Company&#8217;s risk if an individual mortgage loan is not timely purchased by an investor. The average mortgage loan being purchased by the Company reflects a blend of Agency and private investor underwriting guidelines. At December 31, 2019 the Company&#8217;s mortgage warehouse portfolio had an average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 77%, an average credit score of 722 and an average loan size of $292,000. The Company&#8217;s purchases under these Facilities are priced using a combined base rate and a risk premium set for both product type (Prime, Jumbo, etc.) and age of the loan. 

Although not subject to any legally binding commitments, when the Company makes a purchase decision, it acquires a 100% participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its Clients. Individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the Company&#8217;s portfolio only for a short duration, usually averaging less than 30 days. When instructed by a Client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor, the Company delivers the note to the investor that pays the Company which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the Client.

Agriculture Loans . The Company provides agriculture loans for short-term livestock and crop production, including rice, cotton, milo and corn, farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing. The Company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability, level of experience in their particular industry segment, overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry. Because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature, the Company routinely makes on-site visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks. 

Consumer Loans . Consumer loans made by the Company include direct &#8220;A&#8221;-credit automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 180 months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Generally, consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, personal bankruptcy or death. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 

&#160;

Loan Maturities . The contractual maturity ranges of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio by type of loan and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2019 are summarized in the following table. Contractual maturities are based on contractual amounts outstanding and do not include loan purchase discounts of $277.5 million , loans held for sale of $81.0 million or Warehouse Purchase Program loans of $1. 55 billion at December 31, 2019 : &#160;

##TABLE_END

&#160; Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition. Nonperforming assets do not include PCI loans unless the timing and amount of projected cash flows can no longer be reasonably estimated. PCI loans become subject to the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified.

The Company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio. The Company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers, and the Company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. Nevertheless, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.

As part of the on-going monitoring of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio and the methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses, management grades each loan from 1 to 9. For certain loans in risk grades 7 to 9, a specific reserve may be required when calculating the allowance for credit losses.

The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases, unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan.

With respect to potential problem loans, an evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s overall financial condition is made, together with an appraisal for loans collateralized by real estate, to determine the need, if any, for possible write-downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses.

&#160;

The Company had $62.9 million in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 compared with $19.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $37.5 million at December 31, 2017. The nonperforming assets consisted of 232 separate credits or other real estate properties at December 31, 2019, compared with 83 at December 31, 2018 and 99 at December 31, 2017. 

&#160;

If interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued under the origi nal loan terms, approxi mately $2.9 million, $ 1 .7 &#160; million and $ 2.7 million would have been recorded as income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, res pectively. The Company had $55.2 &#160; million, $ 13.1 &#160; million and $ 25.3 &#160; million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

At December 31, 2019, of the total nonperforming assets, $44.8 million resulted from originated loans, $2.4 million resulted from re-underwritten acquired loans, $13.6 million resulted from Non-PCI loans and $2.2 million resulted from PCI loans. At December 31, 2018, of the total nonperforming assets, $14.3 million resulted from originated loans, $2.4 million resulted from re-underwritten acquired loans, $2.2 million resulted from Non-PCI loans and $19 thousand resulted from PCI loans. A PCI loan becomes impaired when there is a deterioration in projected cash flows after acquisition. 

Nonperforming assets were 0.33% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2019 compared with 0.18% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 157.1% at December 31, 2019 and 504.0% at December 31, 2018.

There was no net charge-off activity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans during the periods presented.

##TABLE_END

The allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is affected by the following: (1) charge-offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, further adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.

The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of two components: a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.

&#160;

In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan. The specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below. 

In connection with this review of the loan portfolio, the Company considers risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include:

&#8226; 

for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan to value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of collateral&#59;

&#8226; 

for non-real estate agriculture loans, the operating results, experience and financial capability of the borrower, historical and expected market conditions and the value, nature and marketability of collateral. 

##TABLE_END

In addition, for each category, the Company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors.

In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions, other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. The Company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance.

A change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors, most notably (1) specific reserves identified for impaired loans, (2) historical credit loss information, (3) changes in environmental factors and (4) growth in the balance of originated loans and the re-categorization of fair-valued acquired loans to re-underwritten acquired loans, which subjects such loans to the allowance methodology.

Changes in the Company&#8217;s asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways. Specific reserves that are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Historical credit losses, on the other hand, are based on a three-year look back period, which are then applied to estimate current credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. A deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical credit loss factor to be applied in future periods, just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical credit loss factor.

&#160;

The allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include Company-specific risk indicators and general economic conditions, both of which are constantly changing. The Company evaluates the economic and portfolio-specific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance. The factors include economic metrics, business conditions, delinquency trends, credit concentrations, nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical loss experience. Management&#8217;s assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the inherent probable loss associated with such factors. Based on the Company&#8217;s actual historical loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfolio-specific factors at the time the losses occurred, management is able to identify the probable level of incurred losses as of the date of measurement. The correlation of historical loss experience with current economic conditions provides an estimate of inherent and probable losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and recent historical losses. Additionally, the Company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision. 

Utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves, historical loss experience and a qualitative component, management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full inherent probable loss.

In determining the allowance for credit losses, management also considers the type of loan (originated or re-underwritten acquired) and the credit quality of the loan. The Company distinguishes between originated loans and re-underwritten acquired loans, which are accounted for under the contractual yield method, and fair-valued acquired loans consisting of Non-PCI loans and PCI loans, which are accounted for as purchased loans.

Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of inherent credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for credit losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. When a fair-valued acquired loan is renewed at its maturity date, the loan is re-categorized as a re-underwritten acquired loan. When a fair-valued acquired loan is modified after acquisition, the loan is independently evaluated subsequent to the modification decision to determine whether the modification was substantial, and therefore requires that the loan be re-categorized as a re-underwritten acquired loan. This determination is based on a discounted cash-flow analysis. Generally, when a change in discounted cash-flow of greater than 10% is identified, the fair-valued acquired loan becomes categorized as a re-underwritten acquired loan. If and when a fair-valued acquired loan becomes a re-underwritten acquired loan, the re-underwritten acquired loan is evaluated at the time of renewal or modification in accordance with the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses methodology described above.

Non-PCI loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered non-impaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance. Non-PCI loans that have not become impaired subsequent to acquisition are segregated into a pool for each acquisition for allowance calculation purposes. For each pool, the Company estimates a hypothetical allowance for credit losses also referred to as an &#8220;indicated reserve&#8221; that is calculated in accordance with GAAP requirements. The Company uses the acquired bank&#8217;s past loss history adjusted for qualitative factors to establish the indicated reserve. The indicated reserve for each pool of Non-PCI loans is compared with the remaining discount for the respective pool to test for credit quality deterioration and the possible need for a loan loss provision. To the extent the remaining discount of the pool is greater than the indicated reserve, no additional allowance is necessary. If the remaining discount of the pool is less than the indicated reserve, the difference results in an increase to the allowance recorded through a provision for credit losses.

Non-PCI loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which, when identified, is added to the allowance for credit losses. The Company reviews impaired Non-PCI loans on a loan-by-loan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors: expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Because essentially all of the Company&#8217;s impaired Non-PCI loans have been collateral-dependent, the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the Non-PCI loan with the recorded investment in such loan. In the future, the Company will continue to analyze impaired Non-PCI loans on a loan-by-loan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

PCI loans are individually monitored on a quarterly basis to assess for deterioration subsequent to acquisition and are only subject to the Company&#8217;s allowance methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified. If a deterioration in cash flows is identified, an additional provision for credit losses is made. PCI loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, which were based on expected cash flows and included estimates of expected future credit losses. The Company&#8217;s estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the Company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date. If the Company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date, the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is not calculated for PCI loans that have not experienced deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; above for more information.

&#160;

As described in the section captioned &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; above, the Company&#8217;s determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The Company&#8217;s analysis of qualitative, or environmental, factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics, in combination with the quantitative historical loss information and specific reserves, provides the Company with an estimate of inherent losses. The allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology, as well as the estimated imminent losses associated with those loans. In the Company&#8217;s case, the $ 1.0 million increase in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in total loans, partially offset by a decrease in specific reserves. 

The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for credit losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

At December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses totaled $87.5 million or 0.46% of total loans. At December 31, 2018, the allowance for credit losses totaled $86.4 million or 0.83% of total loans, and at December 31, 2017, the allowance totaled $84.0 million or 0.84% of total loans. 

At December 31, 2019, $77.0 million of the allowance was attributable to originated loans compared with $79.0 million of the allowance at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.9 million or 2.5%. The decrease in the allowance attributable to originated loans was primarily due to the increase in the allowance attributable to re-underwritten acquired loans.

At December 31, 2019, $10.5 million of the allowance was attributable to re-underwritten acquired loans compared with $7.5 million of the allowance at December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.0 million or 39.9%. This change was primarily due to the Merger.

At December 31, 2019, none of the allowance was attributable to Non-PCI loans compared with $9 thousand of the allowance at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $9 thousand or 100.0%. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in specific reserves identified for loans with deteriorated credit quality.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was no allowance for credit losses attributable to PCI loans. 

&#160;

At December 31, 2019, the Company had $277.5 million of total outstanding discounts on Non-PCI and PCI loans, of which $145.8 million was accretable. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $17.7 million of total outstanding discounts on Non-PCI and PCI loans, of which $16.4 million was accretable. 

&#160;

The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 is adequate to cover estimated losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. Nevertheless, the Company could sustain losses in future periods that could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at December 31, 2019 . 

Securities

The Company uses its securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk and as a source of income and liquidity for cash requirements. At December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $8.57 billion, a decrease of $838.9 million or 8.9% compared with $9.41 billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, securities represented 26.6% of total assets compared with 41.5% of total assets at December 31, 2018.

At the date of purchase, the Company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held to maturity, trading or available for sale. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in a separate component of shareholders&#8217; equity until realized.

The following table summarizes the carrying value by classification of securities as of the dates shown:

##TABLE_END

Certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.

In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the time of such determination.

Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held-to-maturity until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2019, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost. In addition, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost. As of December 31, 2019, management believes any impairment in the Company&#8217;s securities is temporary and no impairment loss has been realized in the 

&#160;

Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of income. The Company recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2019, 2018 or 2017. 

The following table summarizes the contractual maturity of securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2019. The contractual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures. The weighted average life of the Company&#8217;s securities portfolio is 3.42 years, with a modified duration of 3.16 at December 31, 2019. Available for sale securities are shown at fair value and held to maturity securities are shown at amortized cost. For purposes of the table below, tax-exempt states and political subdivisions are calculated on a tax equivalent basis.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities monthly pay downs cause the average lives of the securities to be much different than their stated lives. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal, and consequently, the average life of this security will be lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of this security. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies) for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity at such respective dates.

The average tax equivalent yield of the securities portfolio was 2.34% as of December 31, 2019 compared with 2.40% and 2.24% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to the investment in lower yielding securities. Additionally, the average tax equivalent yield was negatively impacted by a lower tax rate in 2018. The average tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was based on a 21% tax rate in 2019 and 2018 and a 35% tax rate in 2017. 

The average yield excluding the tax equivalent adjustment was 2.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2.15% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in the average securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily due to maturities of securities during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These securities are deemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies.

Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion. At December 31, 2019, 59.8% of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 3.81 years.

&#160;

Collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;) are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages. The pools can be Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac pools or they can be private-label pools. CMOs are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds. So long as the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments, the mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules. This is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated in different order. The bond&#8217;s cash flow, for example, can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time, thereby increasing call protection to bondholders. In private-label CMOs, losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority, which means that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies. 

Deposits

The Company&#8217;s lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time accounts. The Company relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits.

Total deposits at December 31, 2019 were $24.20 billion, an increase of $6.94 billion or 40.2% compared with $17.26 billion at December 31, 2018. Total deposits at December 31, 2018 were $17.26 million, a decrease of $564.9 million or 3.2% compared with $17.82 billion at December 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2019 were $7.76 billion compared with $5.67 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.10 billion or 37.0%. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2018 were $5.67 billion compared with $5.62 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $42.8 million or 0.8%. Interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2019 were $16.44 billion, an increase of $4.85 billion or 41.8% compared with $11.59 billion at December 31, 2018. Interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2018 were $11.59 billion, a decrease of $607.7 million or 5.0% compared with $12.20 billion at December 31, 2017. The increases in 2019 were primarily related to the Merger. 

The daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:

&#160;

FHLB advances and long-term notes payable &#8212;The Company has an available line of credit with the FHLB of Dallas, which allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. The Company&#8217;s FHLB advances are typically considered short-term borrowings and are used to manage liquidity as needed. Maturing advances are replaced by drawing on available cash, making additional borrowings or through increased customer deposits. At December 31, 2019, the Company had total funds of $6.72 billion available under this line. FHLB advances were $1.30 billion at December 31, 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.49%. Long-term notes payable were $3.7 million at December 31, 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.37%. The maturity dates on the FHLB notes payable range from the years 2019 to 2027 and have interest rates ranging from 4.54% to 5.99%. 

Securities sold under repurchase agreements with Company customers &#8212;At December 31, 2019, the Company had $377.3 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements compared with $284.7 million at December 31, 2018, with weighted average rates paid of 1.10% and 0.93% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Repurchase agreements are generally settled on the following business day&#59; however, approximately $5.4 million of repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019 have maturity dates ranging from 6 to 24 months. All securities sold under repurchase agreements are collateralized by certain pledged securities. 

&#160;

Subordinated notes &#8212;On November 1, 2019, in connection with the Merger, the Company assumed the obligations related to a $75.0 million and a $50.0 million of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Note (collectively, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) that mature on December 1, 2025 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;). The Notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, have an interest rate of 5.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on each December 1 and June 1 through December 1, 2020. From and including December 1, 2020 through maturity or earlier redemption, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.89%, payable on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year through the maturity date or earlier redemption. The Company may, at its option, beginning on December 1, 2020 and on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any partial redemption will be made pro rata among all of the holders. The Notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of the Company&#8217;s senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all existing and future debt and all other liabilities of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures On November 1, 2019, in connection with the Merger, the Company assumed $15.0 million in junior subordinated debentures, which were redeemed in December 2019. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no junior subordinated debentures outstanding. 

&#160;

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 

The Company&#8217;s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and the Company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position. The Company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines.

As a financial institution, the Company&#8217;s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates ultimately will impact both (1) the level of income and expense recorded on most of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities and (2) the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income, a loss of current fair market values, or both. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while maximizing income.

The Company primarily manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not employ material amounts of instruments such as leveraged derivatives, interest rate swaps, financial options, financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Based upon the nature of the Company&#8217;s operations, with the exception of how commodity prices may impact the Company&#8217;s borrowers&#8217; ability to repay loans, the Company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. The Company is not involved in trading assets for its own account.

The Company&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;), which consists of senior officers of the Company, in accordance with policies approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. The ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (1) an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities&#59; and (2) an interest rate shock simulation model. The Company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates.

The Company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet. Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain, and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model&#8217;s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.

The Company utilizes static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios. This analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet. 

The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income at the 12-month horizon, considering the balance sheet composition as of December 31, 2019:

&#160;

The results are significantly influenced by the behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits and the overall balance sheet composition during such rate fluctuations. The Company has found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on 

&#160;

net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model&#8217;s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies. 

Liquidity

Liquidity involves the Company&#8217;s ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the Company on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. During 2019 and 2018, the Company&#8217;s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits, security and loan maturities, amortizing investment and loan portfolios and advances from the FHLB of Dallas. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, the Company does not generally rely on this external funding source.

The following table illustrates, during the years presented, the mix of the Company&#8217;s funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of the Company&#8217;s average total assets for the periods indicated. Average assets totaled $24.09 billion for 2019 compared with $22.63 billion for 2018.

The Company&#8217;s largest source of funds is deposits and its largest uses of funds are securities and loans. The Company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the foreseeable future. The Company&#8217;s average deposits increased 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company&#8217;s average loans increased 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company predominantly invests excess deposits in government-backed securities until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. The Company&#8217;s securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 3.42 years and a modified duration of 3.16 at December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding $4.38 billion in commitments to extend credit, $127.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and $657.2 million in commitments associated with unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $574.1 million compared with $411.1 million at December 31, 2018.

Standby Letters of Credit . Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the payment by or performance of a customer to a third party. If the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. The Company&#8217;s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. 

Unused Capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program Loans . For Warehouse Purchase Program loans, the Company has established a maximum purchase facility amount, but reserves the right, at any time, to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by its mortgage banking company customers for any reason. 

&#160;

Commitments to Extend Credit . The Company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. The Company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. 

Capital Resources

Capital management consists of providing equity to support the Company&#8217;s current and future operations. The Company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, and the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the FDIC. Both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy. These standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposure, adjusted for credit risk.

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (1) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (2) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (3) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/ adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (4) expanded the scope of the deductions/ adjustments as compared to existing regulations.

The Basel III Capital Rules require a &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, in addition to the minimum risk-weighted asset capital ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

Since being fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require the Company to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, of 2.5%, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.5%, (3) total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of 10.5% and (4) Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets as reported on consolidated financial statements ( known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;) of 4.0%. The Bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the FDIC that are substantially similar to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s guidelines. Also pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the Bank would be considered &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Under the FDIC&#8217;s regulations, the Bank is classified &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for purposes of prompt corrective action.

Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account, as detailed above, will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution&#8217;s &#8220;eligible retained income&#8221; (that is, four-quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).

As of December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 12.30%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.30%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.70% and Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets was 10.42%.

It is important to note that Warehouse Purchase Program loan volumes can increase significantly on the last day of the month, potentially leading to a significant difference between the ending and average balance of Warehouse Purchase Program loans for a given period. At December 31, 2019, Warehouse Purchase Program loans totaled $1.55 billion, compared to an average balance of $251.3 million. Because the capital ratios above are calculated using ending risk-weighted assets and Warehouse Purchase Program loans are risk-weighted at 100%, the end-of-period increase in these balances can significantly impact the Company&#8217;s reported capital ratios.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity increased to $5.97 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $4.05 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.92 billion or 47.3%. This increase was primarily the result of the $1.80 billion common stock issued in connection with the Merger and net income of $332.6 million, partially offset by dividends paid on common stock of $128.9 million and the common stock repurchases totaling $94.5 million.
