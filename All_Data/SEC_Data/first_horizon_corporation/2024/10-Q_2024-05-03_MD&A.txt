PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Introduction 

First Horizon Corporation (NYSE common stock trading symbol &#8220;FHN&#8221;) is a financial holding company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. FHN&#8217;s principal subsidiary, and only banking subsidiary, is First Horizon Bank. Through the Bank and other subsidiaries, FHN offers commercial, private banking, consumer, small business, wealth and trust management, retail brokerage, capital markets, fixed income, and mortgage banking services. 

At March 31, 2024, FHN had over 450 business locations in 24 states, including over 400 banking centers in 12 states, and employed approximately 7,300 associates. 

This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, as well as other information contained in this document and FHN's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Executive Overview 

Significant Events and Transactions 

FDIC Special Assessment 

In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment on banks to replenish the deposit insurance fund following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. FHN recognized an estimated expense of $68 million for the special assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023. In February 2024, the FDIC indicated that it now expects a larger loss to the deposit insurance fund than originally estimated and that it plans to provide institutions with an updated estimate of their total special assessment amount with its first quarter 2024 special assessment invoice, to be 

released in June 2024. This updated special assessment total resulted in $10 million in additional estimated FDIC expense recorded in first quarter 2024. 

Preferred Stock Redemption 

On May 1, 2024, FHN redeemed all outstanding shares of its Series D Preferred Stock with a carrying value of $94 million. The Series D Preferred Stock did not qualify as Tier 1 capital because the earliest redemption date was less than five years from the issuance date. Therefore, the redemption did not impact FHN's regulatory capital ratios. See Note 17 &#8212; Subsequent Events for more information. 

Financial Performance Summary 

FHN reported first quarter 2024 net income available to common shareholders of $184 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $175 million , or $0.31 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2023 and $243 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in first quarter 2023. 

Net interest income of $625 million increased $8 million compared to fourth quarter 2023 from the benefit of loan and deposit repricing. Net interest income declined $63 million compared to first quarter 2023 driven by the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. 

Provision for credit losses of $50 million remained unchanged compared to fourth quarter 2023 and first quarter 2023. 

Noninterest income of $194 million increased $11 million compared to fourth quarter 2023 and $23 million compared to first quarter 2023, largely driven by higher fixed income production. 

Noninterest expense of $515 million decreased $58 million from fourth quarter 2023, largely reflecting the impact of the estimated FDIC special assessment which was $10 million in first quarter 2024 and $68 million 

in fourth quarter 2023. Compared with first quarter 2023, noninterest expense increased $37 million, or 8%, largely attributable to higher personnel and deposit insurance expense. 

Period-end loans and leases of $61.8 billion increased $461 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 as commercial loan growth of $488 million was driven by growth in loans to mortgage companies and CRE loans. 

Period-end deposits of $65.7 billion remained stable compared to December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased $755 million and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $794 million. 

Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at March 31, 2024 were 12.33% and 13.93%, down from 12.42% and 13.96% at December 31, 2023, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 11.31% at March 31, 2024 compared to 11.40% at December 31, 2023. 

The following portions of this MD&#38;A focus in more detail on the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 , the three months ended December 31, 2023, and the three months ended March 31, 2023 and on information about FHN's financial condition, loan and

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. 

The following tables present the major components of net interest income and net interest margin:

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

First Quarter 2024 versus Fourth Quarter 2023 

Net interest income of $625 million in first quarter 2024 increased $8 million from fourth quarter 2023 and the net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.37% from the benefit of loan and deposit repricing. Loan yield increased 9 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 9 basis points. 

Average earning assets of $74.8 billion in first quarter 2024 decreased $670 million from fourth quarter 2023 largely due to a $763 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks partially offset by a $196 million increase in average investment securities. Average loans and leases were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $554 million largely reflecting a $762 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a $100 million increase in other short-term borrowings. 

First Quarter 2024 versus First Quarter 2023 

Net interest income decreased $63 million from first quarter 2023 and the net interest margin decreased 51 basis points from 3.88% in first quarter 2023, driven by the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Funding costs increased 134 basis points while yields on earning assets increased 60 basis points. 

Average earning assets increased $2.7 billion from first quarter 2023 largely driven by a $3.1 billion increase in loans and leases and a $325 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits with banks partially offset by a $673 million decrease in investment securities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.4 billion largely driven by a $8.8 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits.

First Quarter 2024 versus Fourth Quarter 2023 

Noninterest income of $194 million increased $11 million, or 6%, from fourth quarter 2023, largely driven by higher fixed income production. 

Fixed income of $52 million increased $15 million from the prior quarter. Fixed income average daily revenue of $731 thousand increased 58% from $463 thousand in fourth quarter 2023, driven by the market's expectation that short-term rates have peaked as well as improved liquidity conditions in the banking sector. 

Mortgage banking income of $9 million increased $4 million driven by higher origination volume and improvement in gain-on-sale spreads. 

Other income decreased $13 million largely driven by a $9 million gain on an FHN Financial asset disposition in fourth quarter 2023 and a $3 million decrease in FHLB dividends.

First Quarter 2024 versus First Quarter 2023 

Noninterest income for first quarter 2024 increased $23 million, or 13%, compared to first quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher fixed income. 

Fixed income of $52 million increased $13 million from first quarter 2023, largely reflecting more favorable market conditions. 

Mortgage banking income of $9 million increased $4 million driven by higher origination volume and improvement in gain-on-sale spreads.

First Quarter 2024 versus Fourth Quarter 2023 

Noninterest expense of $515 million decreased $58 million, or 10%, compared with fourth quarter 2023, largely driven by lower deposit insurance expense. FHN recognized $10 million in FDIC special assessment expense compared to $68 million in the prior quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million largely reflecting the impact of annual merit adjustments, seasonality in employee benefits, and higher incentive-based compensation from improved fixed income revenue. Advertising and public relations expense decreased $16 million largely attributable to elevated levels of expense from deposit and brand marketing campaigns in the prior quarter. 

First Quarter 2024 versus First Quarter 2023 

Noninterest expense of $515 million increased $37 million, or 8%, from first quarter 2023. Personnel expense increased $30 million largely attributable to annual merit adjustments, higher incentive-based compensation, and higher deferred compensation expense. Deposit insurance expense increased $12 million reflecting an increase in the estimated FDIC special assessment. The $6 million increase in legal and professional fees was largely attributable to strategic investment initiatives in first quarter 2024. The $6 million decrease in advertising and public relations expense was largely attributable to strategy and timing differences for various advertising campaigns when comparing the periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the 

expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

Provision for credit losses remained unchanged at $50 million for the first quarter 2024 compared to both the 

prior quarter and first quarter 2023. For additional information about general asset quality trends, refer to the Asset Quality section in this MD&#38;A. 

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded income tax expe nse of $57 million in first quarter 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $11 million in fourth q uarter 2023 an d income tax expense of $76 million i n first quarter 2023. 

The effective tax rate was approximate ly 22.5%, -6.2%, and 22.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectivel y. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductible portions of FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the reduction in the rate was primarily related to the benefit from the settlement of uncertain tax positions related to prior merger-related items. 

A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying current enacted statutory tax rates to these temporary differences in future years. As of March 31, 2024, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA and gross DTL wer e $792 million and $488 million, respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $304 million at March 31, 2024, compared with a net DTA of $215 million at December 31, 2023. 

As of March 31, 2024, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $29 million and $3 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates. 

Based on current analysis, FHN believes that its ability to realize the DTA is more likely than not. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. A significant adverse change in FHN&#8217;s taxable earnings outlook could result in the need for a valuation allowance. 

Business Segment Results 

FHN's reportable segments include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. See Note 12 - Business Segment Information for additional disclosures related to FHN's segments. 

Regional Banking 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $285 million for first quarter 2024, a decrease of $7 million compared to fourth quarter 2023, largely driven by a decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. Net interest income of $532 million decreased $16 million driven by a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits and thus lower earnings credit under the fund transfer pricing methodology. The provision for credit losses of $28 million remained unchanged from the prior quarter. Noninterest income decreased $1 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest expense decreased $11 million compared to fourth quarter 2023 largely from a reduction in outside services. 

Pre-tax income for first quarter 2024 decreased $30 million compared to $315 million for first quarter 2023. Net interest income decreased $29 million from first quarter 2023 driven by the impact of higher funding costs 

partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. The provision for credit losses decreased $9 million. Noninterest expense increased $11 million compared to first quarter 2023 largely due to higher personnel expense. Results also reflect a $1 million increase in noninterest income compared to first quarter 2023. 

Specialty Banking 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment of $98 million for first quarter 2024 increased $12 million compared to fourth quarter 2023, driven by a $7 million increase in revenue and an $8 million decrease in provision for credit losses, offset by a $4 million increase in noninterest expense. 

Fixed income of $52 million increased $15 million, driven by the market's expectation that short-term rates have peaked as well as improved liquidity conditions in the banking sector. Mortgage banking income of $9 million increased $4 million driven by higher origination volume and improvement in gain-on-sale spreads. Other noninterest income decreased $10 million, primarily from a $9 million gain on an FHN Financial asset disposition in fourth quarter 2023. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment increased $5 million compared to first quarter 2023 driven by higher revenue of $18 million, offset by higher provision for credit losses of $9 million and higher noninterest expense of $4 million. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher fixed income and mortgage banking income. The increase in noninterest expense was largely driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense tied to the improvement in fixed income. 

Corporate 

Pre-tax loss for the Corporate segment was $129 million for first quarter 2024 compared to $200 million for fourth quarter 2023, largely reflecting a $30 million increase in revenue and a $50 million decrease in noninterest expense. The increase in revenue was largely driven by a $25 million increase in net interest income. The decline in noninterest expense was largely attributable to lower deposit insurance expense partially offset by higher 

personnel expense. Results for first quarter 2024 also reflect $5 million in restructuring costs, primarily related to personnel initiatives which will contribute to operational efficiencies. 

Pre-tax loss for the Corporate segment was $129 million compared to $77 million for first quarter 2023, largely reflecting a $36 million decline in net interest income tied to the impact of funds transfer pricing and a $22 million increase in noninterest expense tied to higher personnel and deposit insurance expense. Personnel expense of $103 million increased $20 million reflecting annual merit adjustments, higher incentive-based compensation, and higher deferred compensation expense. Deposit insurance expense increased $11 million, primarily from the FDIC special assessment. Noninterest income increased $6 million compared to the first quarter 2023, largely reflecting higher deferred compensation income.

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale primarily consists of government guaranteed loans under SBA and USDA lending programs. Smaller amounts of other consumer and home equity loans are also included in loans HFS. Additionally, FHN's mortgage banking operations includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by GSEs that are major investors in U.S. home mortgages but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property. These 

non-conforming loans are primarily sold to private companies that are unaffiliated with the GSEs on a servicing-released basis. For further detail, see Note 5 - Mortgage Banking Activity . 

On March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , l oans HFS were $395 million and $502 million, respectively. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $2 million for both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Asset Quality 

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C&#38;I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real es tate loans and credit card and other loans. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate 

loans of 22% and 23% of total loans at March 31, 2024 an d December 31, 2023, respectively. Industry concentrations are discussed un der the C&#38;I heading below. 

Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the Asset Quality Section within the Analysis of Financial Condition discussion . F HN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of March 31, 2024 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 

C&#38;I 

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan and lease portfolio, comprising 53% of total loans as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The C&#38;I portfolio increased $278 million to $32.9 billion as of March 31, 2024 compared to $32.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The C&#38;I portfolio is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C&#38;I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. 

The increase in C&#38;I loans from December 31, 2023 was largely driven by growth in loans to mortgage companies and the wholesale trade portfolio, offset by a decline in 

the finance and insurance portfolio. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2024 were in Tennessee (20%), Florida (13%), Texas (11%), North Carolina (7%), Louisiana (7%), California (5%), and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

(a) Leasing, rental of real estate, equipment, and goods. 

(b) Industries in this category each comprise less than 5% as of March 31, 2024. 

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to mortgage companies and borro wers in the finance and insurance industry were 19% and 18% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry. Loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were 12% of FHN's C&#38;I portfolio as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

Loans to mortgage companie s were 7% and 6% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This portfolio inclu des commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third-party investors. Balances in this portfolio generally fluctuate with mortgage rates and seasonal factors. Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increase when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decrease when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In first quarter 2024, 80% of the loan originations were home purchases and 20% were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represented 12% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of both March 31, 2024 and 

December 31, 2023, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of March 31, 2024, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represented approximately $1.9 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

Real Estate and Rental and Leasing 

Loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were 12% of FHN's C&#38;I portfolio as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This portfolio primarily consists of equipment financing loans and leases to clients across FHN's footprint in a broad range of industries and asset types. This portfolio also includes a smaller balance of loans and leases for solar and wind generating facilities.

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio tota led $14.4 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $14.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The CRE portfolio includes financings for both commercial construction and non-construction loans. This por tfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-perm anent financing of income-producing real estate. 

The large st geographical concentr ations of CRE loan balances as of March 31, 2024 were in Florida (27%), Texas (13%), North Carolina (12%), Georgia (10%), Tennessee (9%), and Louisiana (8%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. The following table represents subcategories of CRE loans by property type:

Consumer Loan Portfolios 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate p ortfolio totaled $13.6 billion and $13.7 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is primaril y composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical co ncentrations of balances as of March 31, 2024 were in Florida (29%), Tennessee (22%), Texas (11%), Louisiana (8%), North Carolina (7%), Georgia (5%), and New York (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 89% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 759 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 756 as of March 31, 2024, no change from FICO scores as of December 31, 2023. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling $30 million and $29 million, respectively. 

HELOCs compris ed $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 

year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of March 31, 2024, approx imately 95% of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period compared to 94% at December 31, 2023. It is expected that $572 million, or 28%, of HELOCs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs nearing the end of the draw perio d are closely monitored.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other consumer loan portfolio totaled $771 million as of March 31, 2024 and $793 million as of December 31, 2023. This portfolio primarily consists of 

consumer-related credits, including home equity and other personal consumer loans, credit card receivables, and automobile loans. The $22 million decrease was driven by net repayments in the overall portfolio. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP . For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 4 of this Report and "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and Note 4 in FHN's 2023 Form 10-K. 

The ALLL increased to $787 million as of March 31, 2024 from $773 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the ALLL balance as of March 31, 2024 reflects an 

evolving macroeconomic outlook, modest grade migration, and net commercial loan balance increases. The ALLL to total loans and leases ratio increased 1 basis point to 1.27% compared to 1.26% as of December 31, 2023. The ACL to total loans and leases ratio remained steady at 1.40% as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs in first quarter 2024 were $40 million, or an annualized 27 basis points of total loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of $16 million, or 11 basis 

points of total loans and leases, in first quarter 2023. The $24 million increase in net charge-offs was driven by higher charge-offs in the commercial portfolio.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis) if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccrual are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 

Total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) increased to $512 million as of March 31, 2024 from $469 million as of December 31, 2023, largely driven by an increase in commercial loans placed on non-accrual. The nonperforming loans and leases ratio increased 7 basis points to 0.82% as of March 31, 2024 compared to year-end 2023.

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal 

banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio were $712 million on March 31, 2024 and $666 million on December 31, 2023. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. See 

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, Note 3 - Loans and Leases, and Note 4 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further discussion regarding troubled loan modifications.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Commercial Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s credit risk management governance processes, the Loan Rehab and Recovery Department (LRRD) is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are individually reviewed for expected credit losses, classified as substandard or worse, placed on nonaccrual status, foreclosed or in process of foreclosure, or in active or contemplated litigation. LRRD has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout and/or rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate and/or minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets. While every circumstance is different, LRRD will generally use forbearance agreements (generally 6-12 months) as an element of commercial loan workouts, which might include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, release of guarantor, term extensions or entering into short sale agreements. Principal forgiveness may be granted in specific workout circumstances. 

The individual expected credit loss assessments completed on commercial loans are used in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments to quantitatively modeled loss expectations for loans that are not considered collateral dependent. If a loan is collateral dependent, the carrying amount of a loan is written down to the net realizable value of the collateral. Each assessment considers any modified terms and is comprehensive to ensure appropriate assessment of expected credit losses. 

Consumer Loan Modifications 

FHN does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the U.S. government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former Home Affordable Modification Program. 

Within the HELOC and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 1% for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification; for certain modifications, the modified interest rate increases 2% per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved. 

Permanent mortgage troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 2% for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate steps up 1 percent every year until it reaches the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Weekly Survey Rate cap. Contractual maturities may be extended to 40 years on permanent mortgages and to 30 years for consumer real estate loans. 

Within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for 6 months to 1 year. In the credit card workout program, clients are granted a rate reduction to 0% and term extensions for up to 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 

Consumer loans may also be modified through court-imposed principal reductions in bankruptcy proceedings, which FHN is required to honor unless a borrower reaffirms the related debt. 

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities available for sale. FHN maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of government agency issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations . T he securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect 

the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. These evaluations may result in steps taken to adjust the overall balance sheet positioning. 

Investment securities were $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing 12% of total assets for both periods. See Note 2 - Investment Securities for more information about the securities portfolio.

Deposits 

Total deposits of $65.7 billion as of March 31, 2024 were stable compared to December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased $755 million and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $794 million. FHN continues to focus on building and deepening relationships to retain new clients obtained from the 2023 promotional campaigns. 

FHN continues to maintain a well-diversified and stable funding mix across its footprint and specialty lines of business. 

At March 31, 2024, commercial deposits were $36.2 billion, or 55% of total deposits and consumer deposits were $29.5 billion, or 45% of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, commercial deposits were $35.9 billion, or 55% of total deposits and consumer deposits were $29.9 billion, or 45% of total deposits. 

At March 31, 2024, 38% of deposits were associated with Tennessee, 18% with Florida, 13% with North Carolina, 

and 12% with Louisiana, with no other state above 10%. This mix remained consistent with December 31, 2023. 

Total estimated uninsured deposits were $27.4 billion and $26.8 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, representing 42% and 41% of total deposits, respectively. Of the uninsured deposits at March 31, 2024, $5.5 billion, or 8% of total deposits, were collateralized. At December 31, 2023, collateralized deposits were $5.3 billion, or 8% of total deposits. 

See Table I.2.2 - Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Yields/Rates in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates paid. 

Th e following table summarizes the major components of deposits as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities, and other short-term borrowings. Total short-term borrowings were $3.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 compared to $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 . 

Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. 

Trading liabilities fluctuate based on various factors, including levels of trading securities and hedging strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Total term borrowings were $1.2 billion as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of March 31, 2024, both FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 

For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios decreased in first quarter 2024 relative to year-end 2023 primarily from the impact of common share repurchases and net income less dividends. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio for both FHN and First Horizon Bank increased from year-end 2023 largely as a result of a decrease in average assets. 

During 2024, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. 

Common Stock Purchases 

FHN may purchase shares of its common stock from time to time, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN's Board has authorized the common stock purchase program described below. FHN&#8217;s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

2024 General Purchase Program 

On January 23, 2024, FHN announced that its Board of Directors approved a new $650 million common share purchase program that is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2025. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases are subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

performance, expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, business conditions, and regulatory considerations. Absent a Rule 10b5-1 plan, FHN does not purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior executives are prohibited from purchasing FHN stock on the open market. 

As of March 31, 2024, $154 million in purchases had been made life-to-date under the 2024 program at an average price per share of $14.39, or $14.37 excluding commissions. Program purchases made during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table.

Stock Award Purchases 

As authorized by the Board's Compensation Committee, FHN makes automatic stock purchases by withholding stock-based award shares to cover tax obligations associated with those awards. Those limited, off-market 

purchases are not associated with an announced purchase program and are made any time an associated tax obligation arises, whether or not a blackout period is in effect. Tax withholding purchases made during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table.

Risk Management 

There have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s risk management practices as described under &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; included in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year 

lookback period at a 99% confidence level with 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is presented in the following table:

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 

Table I.2.19 

SCHEDULE OF RISKS INCLUDED IN VaR 

&#160; As of March 31, 2024 As of March 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 $ 4 $ 1 $ 2 Credit spread risk 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 1 1 1 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory 

continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHNF&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its VaR measures. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the Capital section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within FHN Financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides 

only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus/minus 25 basis points, plus/minus 50 basis points, plus/minus 100 basis points, and plus/minus 200 basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below.

A steepening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

results in a favorable NII variance of 0.4%. A flattening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 0.5%. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

Short-term interest rates have reached their highest levels in 15 years, which coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures, has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs. 

The yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of 2022, throughout 2023, and during the first quarter 2024. The inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that short-term rates have likely peaked and then could decline in future periods. Market participants are now projecting a few rate cuts in 2024 while the December 2023 Fed Dot plot has indicated three 25 basis point cuts in 2024. FHN continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely. For additional information, see Yield Curve within Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends below. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. After the banking crisis in the first half of 2023, ALCO and the Board examined the liquidity risk management framework and policies to ensure alignment with evolving regulatory expectations, industry best practices, and the company&#8217;s risk appetite. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels, and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. As of March 31, 2024, available liquidity sources included cash, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHLB, access to Federal Reserve Bank borrowings through the discount window, and unencumbered securities. Additional sources of liquidity included dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal Funds markets, brokered deposits, loan sales, and syndications. The FRB Bank Term Funding Program expired on March 11, 2024. The table below details FHN's sources of available liquidity at March 31, 2024. 

Table I.2.21

Generally, a primary source of funding for a bank is core deposits from the bank's client base. The period-end loans-to-deposits ratio was 94% as of March 31, 2024 and 93% as of December 31, 2023. 

FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity, and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. As of March 31, 2024 , FHN had outstanding $797 million in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and $520 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. On April 1, 2024, 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

FHN provided notice of its intent to redeem all outstanding shares of its Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, effective May 1, 2024. Following the redemption on May 1, 2024, no shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding. Refer to Note 17 - Subsequent Events for additional information. As of March 31, 2024, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $1.1 billion as of April 1, 2024. 

In March 2022, FHN agreed to suspend the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in connection with the TD Transaction. During the suspension period, dividend payments of FHN are not automatically reinvested in additional shares of FHN common stock and participants in the Plan are not able to purchase shares of FHN common stock through optional cash investments under the Plan. 

First Horizon Bank declared and paid a common dividend to the parent company in the amount of $310 million and $150 million in first and second quarter 2024, respectively. Total common dividends of $220 million were declared and paid to the parent company in 2023. First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in first quarter of 2024 and declared and paid preferred dividends in each quarter of 2023. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in second quarter 2024, payable in July 2024. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions (including capital conservation buffer requirements) and availability of funds to FHN 

through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. 

FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on April 1, 2024. FHN paid cash dividends of $1,625 per Series E preferred share and $1,175 per Series F preferred share on April 10, 2024 and $165 per Series C preferred share and $305 per Series D preferred share on May 1, 2024. In addition, in April 2024, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers, including loan commitments, lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments. 

Repurchase Obligations 

Prior to September 2008, legacy First Horizon originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the 

active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

As discussed in Note 10 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage origination, sale, securitization, and servicing businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline, estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The active pipeline consists of mortgage loan repurchase and make-whole demands from loan purchasers or securitization participants, foreclosure/servicing demands from borrowers, and certain related exposures. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with 

loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellation rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The total repurchase and foreclosure liability, which includes both the legacy pre-2009 business and the current mortgage business, was $16 million as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses, industries, or sectors. Additional risks relate to political uncertainty, changes in federal policies (including those publicly discussed, formally 

proposed, or recently implemented) and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients, and whether FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives will succeed. 

In addition to trends and events noted elsewhere in this MD&#38;A, FHN believes the following trends and events are noteworthy at this time. 

Inflation, Recession, and Federal Reserve Policy 

Economic Overview 

The post-COVID economy in the U.S. has been marked by: strong inflation, which began in 2021, peaked in 2022, and abated, though not fully, starting in 2023; the Federal Reserve "tightening" in 2022 and the first half of 2023 to contain inflation by rapidly increasing short-term interest rates and ending asset purchases; low unemployment rates; moderate economic growth; and a profoundly inverted yield curve. Key aspects were: 

&#8226; Although the U.S. economy flirted with recession in 2022, it did not officially enter one. In 2023 recession expectations moderated significantly. Early in 2024, recession expectations for the rest of this year generally are low. 

&#8226; The rise in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2022 was both rapid and substantial, taking the overnight Fed Funds rate from 0.20% in March 

2022 to 4.65% a year later. Hikes after that were much more modest and infrequent. 

&#8226; In response to 2022's extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy, the inflation rate in the U.S. now is well below 2022's levels. However, measures of inflation generally remain higher than the Federal Reserve's stated long-term goal of 2%. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve has signaled that hikes have ended and that a short term rate cut might become appropriate. No policy or timing commitments have been made. Future actions continue to depend upon future data. 

&#8226; In first quarter 2024, inflation measures rose modestly, reversing a slow down-trend in 2023 and ending most expectations of a rate cut in the near term. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

&#8226; Monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time. In the current cycle, traditional inversion (when ten-year treasury rates are below two-year rates) has been both very deep and unusually sustained, with the current inversion having begun in the summer of 2022. 

&#8226; Many factors likely contributed to the current sustained inversion. The immediate cause, of course, is that demand for long-term treasury debt has remained high, depressing yields, even though short yields are higher. The underlying causes of that demand imbalance likely are complex and open to debate. 

&#8226; A short-term rate cut by the Federal Reserve should lessen inversion, but only if long-term rates do not likewise drop. 

Key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions. 

Federal Reserve and Rates 

The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates several times in 2022 and in the first part of 2023. All but one of the raises in 2022 were 75 and 50 basis points each&#8212;aggressive by historical standards&#8212;while the 2023 raises were the more-typical 25 basis points each. The Federal Reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession. The Federal Reserve has indicated that future decisions will be heavily impacted by economic data, especially inflation-rate and -trend data, available at each decision point. Most recently the Federal Reserve has indicated an expectation that its next action, at an unspecified future point, will be a rate cut rather than a rate hike. 

FHN cannot predict exactly when or how much short-term rates will be changed, how market-driven long-term rates will behave, nor how those actions may affect financial markets, during the rest of 2024. 

Yield Curve 

Unusual yield curve effects, including inversion, are common when monetary policy changes. A traditional measure of inversion occurs when the two-year U.S. Treasury rate is higher than the ten-year rate. Traditional inversion has been sustained continuously since the summer of 2022, an unusually long period. The degree of inversion has varied during that period, but generally has been much deeper than is typical. Sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed, with statistical support, as a harbinger of economic recession, but recession has not yet occurred and the U.S. economy currently does not appear close to entering one. 

The most recent period with deep and longer-lasting inversion was over 40 years ago. That 4-5 year period was marked by stagflation (low economic growth coupled with high inflation), followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a severe recession. 

Yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit FHN can make from lending by compressing FHN's net interest margin, and also generally reduces FHN's revenues from bond trading. Refer to Interest Rate &#38; Yield Curve Risks , located in Item 1A. Risk Factors of FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, f or a discussion of the risks to FHN associated with flattening and inversion. 

Recession 

The U.S. economy contracted (experienced negative growth) during the first two quarters of 2022, in both cases modestly. Although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession, in 2022 it did not. The economy expanded in each quarter since then. 

Recession expectations in the U.S. were high in 2022 and early 2023. They moderated significantly after that. Current recession expectations generally are low. 

Banking Crisis 

In March 2023, two large regional U.S. banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows, and a major Swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators. In the aftermath of the two U.S. failures, bank investors and clients across the U.S. became more focused on deposit mix, funding risk management, and other safety-soundness concerns. The market values of virtually all U.S. bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in March, with a few falling about 90%. 

Following these failures, the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors. Most U.S. banks saw net outflows of deposits in 2022 and early 2023 as the impacts of COVID-19 crisis programs faded and rates available from non-bank-account investments improved. According to Federal Reserve data, starting in mid-March, the two failures triggered an abrupt and substantial net deposit outflow from all but the largest U.S. banks. The March crisis shock was short-lived, however. During the final week of March both large and small U.S. banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits, roughly mirroring the first week of March, before the crisis emerged. 

The two U.S. bank failures resulted in Congressional calls for higher regulation of mid-sized regional banks, especially for those with $100 billion or more of assets. 

In early May a third large regional U.S. bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in March. Although this failure was widely anticipated, volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in May. By June bank-stock volatility had abated again, but with regional bank prices well below pre-crisis levels. 

The three failed U.S. banks had a few characteristics that FHN believes were significant negative factors contributing to loss of confidence by depositors, in addition to having an unusual customer mix: well-above-median levels of deposits not covered by FDIC insurance; 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

significant portions of the 2020-21 pandemic deposit inflows invested in longer-term fixed-rate debt securities; and very high (in relation to regulatory capital) market value losses on those investments when rates rose in 2022 and early 2023. These factors made those banks unusually susceptible to a cascade of negative effects when deposit levels diminished, for the entire industry, starting in 2022 as customers sought better returns in the rising rate environment. 

Market Volatility &#38; Valuations 

As a result of the prospects for recession, coupled with the uncertainties associated with war in eastern Europe, financial markets world-wide were volatile during much of 2022. Volatility overall moderated somewhat in 2023, but volatile episodes have continued. War in the Middle East that started in October 2023 had a much more muted financial market impact than was true in 2022. 

Financial asset values broadly fell in 2022, especially during the second and third quarters. By mid-year 2023, broad stock indices largely had recovered from 2022's low points, but longer-term fixed-rate debt investments remained well below previous values. By year-end 2023, stock values in most (but not all) sectors had recouped much of their earlier losses, and debt investment values generally improved somewhat from their lows when long-term rates fell in anticipation of possible short-term rate cuts in 2024 by the Federal Reserve. Those late-2023 trends generally have continued into 2024. 

Impacts on FHN 

In 2022, FHN benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates. In the first quarter of 2023, that outpacing ended, and FHN's net interest margin started to compress. FHN was able to reverse the compression during the year fueled in part by using increased deposits and capital to reduce borrowings. Moderate margin expansion continued in first quarter 2024, though it remained well below the same quarter in 2023. 

In 2022 and early 2023, FHN experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter 2020 as it allowed surge deposits resulting from COVID-driven stimulus 

programs to move off its balance sheet. Net deposit outflows ranged from roughly $2.0 to $4.0 billion in each of the last three quarters of 2022, and fell again by roughly $2.5 billion in first quarter 2023. That outflow trend ended in second quarter as FHN had net deposit inflows of $4.0 billion. For the year 2023, net deposits increased over $2 billion. However, FHN increased deposit rates appreciably in 2023, particularly in May and June. Rates paid abated somewhat in first quarter 2024 as 2023's promotional rates have reverted to market norms. Deposits at the end of first quarter 2024 were roughly unchanged from year-end 2023. 

In addition, some of FHN's businesses have been negatively impacted by higher rates and inversion. Rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the U.S. much higher than in early 2022, reducing demand. FHN's direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in 2022 and 2023. Moreover, FHN's revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in 2022 and 2023 due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility. In first quarter 2024, bond trading revenues and mortgage activity improved. Bond revenues likely benefited from the market's expectation that short-term rates have peaked along with improved liquidity conditions in the banking sector. Recent inflation data likely have reduced current market expectations of rate cuts. A change in market expectations for fewer cuts or rate hikes may be a moderating factor in bond trading revenues in future quarters. 

A recession, if one were to occur, likely would have a negative impact on FHN's businesses overall. Demand for loans likely would fall, loan losses and provision expense likely would rise, many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline, and competition for clients likely would sharpen. The deeper or longer a recession lasts, the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for FHN. As mentioned above, recessionary expectations have abated substantially since early 2023 and remain low currently. However, just as expectations in early 2023 proved to be wrong, current expectations may be just as incorrect. 

Other Regulatory Proposals 

In 2023 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and other regulators proposed regulatory changes that would, if implemented, significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all U.S. banks with assets over $100 billion. A few new requirements would apply to banks, like FHN, with assets over $50 billion, but by far the main impacts would fall on banks greater than $100 billion in assets. 

The proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements, including debt and equity capital requirements, credit risk standards, asset risk-weighting, and resolution planning. 

The increased requirements also would entail additional compliance costs. 

The triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure&#8212;$100 billion in assets&#8212;has been in place for many years and has impacted the U.S. banking industry. Compliance restrictions and costs increase as the threshold is approached but a step-up pattern remains. Banks near the threshold may be likely to slow or even halt asset growth, at least for a period, and start to implement the higher-level compliance systems. Banks modestly over the threshold, in contrast, may be 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

likely to expand their asset base as quickly as possible to generate additional revenues to cover those costs. Those effects have added to the incentives for banks to consolidate, and the proposed new rules are likely to enhance that. 

It appears likely that, if adopted as proposed, significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being 

inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress in 2018. Such a challenge would be technical and complex, and likely would take many years to resolve. Moreover, even if a challenge of that sort were successful, many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others might be modified without being rescinded. 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Regimes 

In October 2023 the state of California enacted laws which, taken together, will require most larger companies doing business in California to report annually their greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, with an external assurance requirement, and to report biennially their climate-related financial risks and risk-mitigation measures. The California laws include multi-year phase in periods and encompass Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. The California governor stated in 2023 that the new laws are likely to be subjected to technical amendments in 2024 or later. 

In March 2024 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted rules that would require all U.S. companies with publicly-traded securities to report annually their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and related risk management processes, along with a related financial statement and audit requirement. Refer to "Accounting Changes" below for additional information. The SEC rules also have a lengthy phase-in period. 

Europe also has adopted a GHG reporting regime. It is not applicable to FHN and is not further discussed here. 

Three GHG Scopes 

Scope 1 GHG emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly, such as a manufacturing plant. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from company activities, such as from power consumed by company operations. Scope 1 and 2 emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry. 

Scope 3 GHG emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls. Scope 3 emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company, such as: vendors; employees (commuting, business travel, etc.); and customers. Scope 3 information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry and/or estimation. 

Potential Business Impacts 

Direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data, staffing, and engagement of vendors, including a firm to provide 

required assurances (somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor). 

Potentially of more significance: California may require inquiry of customers rather than merely estimation about them. If FHN is allowed merely to estimate emissions from customers, that process may be costly but would not interfere with our business relationships. If, however, FHN is required to support Scope 3 reporting by obtaining GHG-related information from customers, including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in California, then the California disclosure laws could interfere with FHN's business. In that case, effectively FHN would be required to impose costs and/or inconveniences on its customers. Other banks in FHN's markets, particularly those that are private and not doing business in California, could provide financial services without those requirements, putting FHN at a competitive disadvantage. 

Legal Challenges 

The California laws, especially the application of those laws to companies outside of California, have been challenged in court. Challengers assert that the laws, among other things, unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce, are pre-empted by federal law, and unconstitutionally compel or burden speech. Challenges could take many years to resolve. A key practical question will be whether the courts impose a legal stay (a moratorium) on these laws nationwide while challenges are pending. 

The SEC rules likewise are being challenged in court. Challengers assert, among other things, that the SEC lacks explicit Congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to GHG emissions. The several challenges have been consolidated in the U.S. (federal) 8th Circuit. Possibly anticipating a court-ordered stay, the SEC has suspended the effectiveness of its rules while the court challenges are pending. 

Assuming that the various legal challenges leave the SEC's rules entirely or largely intact, the California laws might be further challenged by public companies as having been pre-empted by the SEC rules. 

1Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Coastal Market Growth and Rising Costs 

FHN's principal markets are in the southern and southeastern United States, including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern Atlantic seacoast. Many of FHN's markets have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years, outpacing the growth rate for the U.S. as a whole. That population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth. 

Many of FHN's fastest growing markets, including most significantly those in Florida, can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events. As those markets grow, FHN's economic commitment to them grows, as does FHN's financial exposure to those events. 

In 2023 and this year it has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane events in the U.S. gulf and southern Atlantic coastal areas have been rising significantly. FHN believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas. 

For example, much of the growth in Florida has been along the coast moving out from older cities. A gulf coast hurricane 50 or 60 years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area. Now, the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher, the average population in that center is much higher, and the average value per building is much higher. 

The reported significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices which currently are in significant flux. The insurance 

industry is being forced to revise its risk assessment and premium pricing practices in coastal areas as loss experience has deviated from earlier predictions, sometimes badly. In Florida, for example, some smaller carriers have failed, some larger carriers have left markets, and remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricane-related insurance, narrowed coverage, or both. 

Coastal states such as Florida and Louisiana have created last-resort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance. However, as the costs borne by those pools increase, either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference. In addition, those programs generally do not help business clients. 

State and local building and water-control codes are being revised, but often unevenly and often not retroactive to pre-existing structures and developments. The current transition period could be lengthy. 

The availability, reliability, and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for FHN as well as FHN's clients in affected markets. Instability in property insurance has made, and continues to make, FHN's business decisions more difficult. That instability increases FHN's risks of loan loss and business downturn. 

More fundamentally, elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these high-growth markets: lower costs of living. If market growth slows, FHN's business will be impacted. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

FHN has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Accounting Changes 

In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules, &#8220;The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors&#8221; (the &#8220;Climate Disclosures Rules&#8221;) to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. Information required for inclusion within the footnotes to the financial statements for severe weather events and other natural conditions includes 1) income statement effects before insurance recoveries above 1% of pre-tax income/loss, 2) balance sheet effects above 1% of shareholders&#8217; equity, and 3) certain carbon offsets and renewable energy credits. Qualitative discussion is also required for material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that are due to severe weather events and other natural conditions or disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans. 

Disclosures within registration statements that are outside the financial statements include 1) Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, if material, 2) how the Board of Directors oversees the assessment and management of climate-related risks, 3) management&#8217;s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks if the risks are material, 4) climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, including whether the risks are expected to manifest in the short term (i.e., next 12 months) and, separately, in the long term (i.e., beyond the next 12 months), 5) if a registrant has adopted a plan to manage material climate transition risks the plan should be described and updated annually to specify its progress toward completing the transition plan, including any actions taken under the plan and how those actions

have affected the registrant&#8217;s business, results of operations, or financial condition, 6) if a registrant has adopted a plan to manage material climate transition risks the plan should be described and updated annually to specify its progress toward completing the transition plan, including any actions taken under the plan and how those actions have affected the registrant&#8217;s business, results of operations, or financial condition, 7) if a registrant uses an internal carbon price (e.g., a monetary cost assigned to carbon emissions for budgeting, forecasting, or performance management) and this use is material to how it evaluates material climate-related risks, 8) if a registrant uses a scenario analysis to assess its business in the context of climate-related risks and, on the basis of that analysis, determines that a climate-related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact, the registrant must describe each scenario, including the parameters, assumptions, and projected financial impacts, 9) a registrant is required to disclose its processes for &#8220;identifying, assessing and managing&#8221; material climate-related risks, 10) registrants must disclose information about their publicly announced or internal climate-related targets or goals if they materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the business, results of operations, or financial condition (e.g., expenditures or operational changes needed to meet the targets or goals) and 12) registrants must describe quantitatively and qualitatively the material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, in management&#8217;s assessment, directly result from activities to mitigate or adapt to material climate-related risks. 

In April 2024, the SEC issued a stay of the Climate Disclosures Rules pending the completion of judicial review of various legal challenges. Therefore, the actual timing of the implementation of the Climate Disclosure Rules, if sustained through the judicial process, is uncertain. FHN is assessing the potential effects of the Climate Disclosure Rules on its registration statements and financial statements.
