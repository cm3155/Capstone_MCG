PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Introduction 

First Horizon Corporation (NYSE common stock trading symbol &#8220;FHN&#8221;) is a financial holding company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. FHN&#8217;s principal subsidiary, and only banking subsidiary, is First Horizon Bank. Through the Bank and other subsidiaries, FHN offers regional banking, mortgage lending, specialized commercial lending, commercial leasing and equipment financing, brokerage, wealth management, capital markets, and other financial services to commercial, consumer, and governmental clients throughout the U.S. At September 30, 2023, FHN had over 450 business 

locations in 24 states, including over 400 banking centers in 12 states, and employed approximately 7,300 associates. 

This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, as well as other information contained in this document and FHN's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Executive Overview 

Significant Events and Transactions 

On August 3, 2023, FHN announced a five-year employment agreement with Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer D. Bryan Jordan. A copy of the 

agreement has been filed with a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Financial Performance Summary 

Third Quarter 2023 Highlights 

FHN reported third quarter 2023 net income available to common shareholders of $129 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $317 million , or $0.56 per diluted share, in second quarter 2023 and $257 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in third quarter 2022. 

Net interest income of $605 million declined $25 million compared to second quarter 2023 and $57 million compared to third quarter 2022 as the benefit of higher rates and loan balances was more than offset by higher funding costs. 

Provision for credit losses of $110 million increased $60 million compared to second quarter 2023 and $50 million compared to third quarter 2022, largely driven by a credit loss on a single relationship as well as the impact of loan growth. 

Noninterest income of $173 million decreased $227 million compared to second quarter 2023 largely driven by a $225 million gain on merger termination recognized in second quarter. Noninterest income decreased $40 million compared to third quarter 2022 primarily driven by lower fixed income, lower securities gains and the 2022 gain on sale of FHN's title business. 

Noninterest expense of $474 million decreased $81 million from second quarter 2023, largely reflecting the impact of a $50 million contribution to the First Horizon Foundation in the second quarter and lower personnel expense. Compared with third quarter 2022, noninterest expense increased $5 million, or 1%. There were no merger and integration expenses in third quarter 2023 compared to $30 million in second quarter 2023 and $24 million in third quarter 2022. 

Year-to-Date and Period End Highlights 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income available to common shareholders was $689 million or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to $610 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Net interest income increased $240 million largely driven by higher earning asset yields, loan growth, and higher investment portfolio balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Provision for credit losses increased $160 million largely from a credit loss on a single relationship, loan growth and an evolving macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest income increased $103 million, or 16%, primarily from the gain on merger termination, partially offset by lower fixed income and mortgage banking and title income. Noninterest expense increased $58 million, or 4%, largely attributable to the $50 million contribution made to the First Horizon Foundation in the second quarter. 

Period-end loans and leases of $61.8 billion increased $3.7 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2022 driven by commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion and consumer loan growth of $1.4 billion. 

Period-end deposits of $67.0 billion increased $3.5 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2022 driven by a $9.2 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits offset by a $5.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. 

Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2023 were 12.12% and 13.63%, an improvement from 11.92% and 13.33% at December 31, 2022, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 11.12% at

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. 

The following tables present the major components of net interest income and net interest margin:

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Third Quarter 2023 versus Second Quarter 2023 

Net interest income of $605 million in third quarter 2023 decreased $25 million from second quarter 2023 and the net interest margin declined 21 basis points to 3.17%. The benefit of higher rates and loan growth was more than offset by higher funding costs driven by customer deposit growth. Loan yield increased 21 basis points while the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 81 basis points. 

Average earning assets of $76.3 billion in third quarter 2023 increased $1.0 billion from second quarter 2023 largely due to a $1.5 billion increase in average loans and leases partially offset by a $381 million decrease in average investment securities and a $243 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.2 billion largely reflecting a $6.6 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a $4.6 billion decrease in other short-term borrowings. 

Third Quarter 2023 versus Third Quarter 2022 

Net interest income decreased $57 million from third quarter 2022 largely as a result of higher funding costs which more than offset higher yields on earning assets. 

Third quarter 2023 net interest margin decreased 31 basis points from 3.48% in third quarter 2022, driven by the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Funding costs increased 289 basis points while yields on earning assets increased 178 basis points. 

Average earning assets increased $343 million from third quarter 2022 largely driven by a $4.9 billion increase in loans and leases offset by a $3.5 billion decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and a $504 million decrease in investment securities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $8.5 billion largely driven by a $6.9 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest income of $1.9 billion increased $240 million from the same period one year ago largely driven by higher earning asset yields, loan growth, and higher investment portfolio balances partially offset by higher funding costs. 

Total average earning assets decreased $4.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023 largely due to lower levels of interest-bearing cash offset by loan growth. 

The year-to-date net interest margin of 3.47% increased 62 basis points compared to 2.85% for the same period of 2022 as the benefit of higher earning asset yields and lower excess cash balances were partially offset by an increase in funding costs. Earning asset yields increased 233 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 250 basis points. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

Provision for credit losses increased to $110 million for the third quarter 2023 compared to $50 million for the second 

quarter 2023, largely driven by a credit loss on a single relationship and the impact of loan growth. The third quarter 2023 provision increased $50 million compared to third quarter 2022 and the year-to-date provision increased $160 million compared to the same period one year ago, largely from loan growth, an evolving macroeconomic outlook, and a credit loss on a single relationship.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Third Quarter 2023 versus Second Quarter 2023 

Noninterest income of $173 million decreased $227 million, or 57%, from second quarter 2023, primarily as a result of the $225 million gain resulting from the TD merger termination that was recognized in the second quarter. 

Fixed income of $28 million decreased $2 million from the prior quarter. Fixed income average daily revenue of $301 thousand decreased from $348 thousand in second quarter 2023, a decrease of 14%, reflecting continued challenging market conditions. 

Mortgage banking and title income of $7 million increased $1 million driven by higher origination volume resulting from a pricing strategy to shift production into the secondary market. 

Deferred compensation income of less than $1 million decreased $8 million reflecting fluctuations in equity 

market valuations relative to the prior quarter. This decrease is largely offset in noninterest expense. 

Other income increased $8 million largely driven by an increase in FHLB dividends. 

Third Quarter 2023 versus Third Quarter 2022 

Noninterest income for third quarter 2023 decreased $40 million, or 19%, compared to third quarter 2022, primarily driven by lower fixed income, lower securities gains and the impact of the $21 million gain on sale of FHN's title business in third quarter 2022. 

Fixed income of $28 million decreased $18 million from third quarter 2022, largely reflecting less favorable market conditions.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income of $745 million increased $103 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily from the gain on merger termination, partially offset by lower fixed income and mortgage banking and title income. 

Fixed income of $97 million decreased $73 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Fixed income product revenue decreased $65 million largely driven by less favorable market conditions and revenue from other products decreased $8 million 

primarily driven by lower fees from loan and derivative sales. 

Mortgage banking and title income of $18 million decreased $47 million driven by lower origination volume given the impact of higher long-term rates. 

Deferred compensation income increased $35 million for the year-to-date period of 2023 reflecting fluctuations in equity market valuations relative to the prior year. This increase is largely offset in noninterest expense.

Third Quarter 2023 versus Second Quarter 2023 

Noninterest expense of $474 million decreased $81 million, or 15%, compared with second quarter 2023, largely driven by a $50 million contribution made to the First Horizon Foundation in the second quarter. Personnel expense decreased $19 million largely reflecting lower incentive-based compensation and deferred compensation expense. Other expense decreased $10 million, primarily from derivative valuation adjustments related to prior Visa Class-B share sales recognized in the second quarter. There were no merger and integration expenses in third quarter 2023 compared to $30 million in second quarter 2023. 

Third Quarter 2023 versus Third Quarter 2022 

Noninterest expense of $474 million increased $5 million, or 1%, from third quarter 2022. Personnel expense decreased $9 million largely attributable to lower incentive-based compensation. Deposit insurance expense increased $6 million largely due to an increase in the FDIC initial base deposit insurance assessment rate that went into effect in first quarter 2023 for all insured depository institutions. The $4 million increase in advertising and public relations expense was partially attributable to deposit campaigns and brand awareness initiatives. There were no merger and integration expenses in third quarter 2023 compared to $24 million in third quarter 2022.

NM - Not meaningful 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest expense increased $58 million, or 4%, largely attributable to the $50 million contribution made to the First Horizon Foundation in the second quarter 2023. 

Personnel expense of $821 million increased $1 million reflecting higher deferred compensation expense partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation expense. 

Deposit insurance expense of $40 million increased $17 million largely due to an increase in the FDIC initial base deposit insurance assessment rate that went into effect in first quarter 2023 for all insured depository institutions. 

Advertising and public relations expense increased $13 million partially attributable to deposit campaign and brand awareness initiatives. 

Legal and professional fees decreased $17 million largely attributable to lower merger and integration related expense. 

Total merger and integration related expense was $51 million for the first nine months of 2023 compared to $99 million for the same period of 2022. 

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded income tax expe nse of $52 million in third quarter 2023 compared to $96 million in second q uarter 2023 an d $78 million i n third quarter 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, FHN recorded income tax expense of $223 million and $183 million, respectively. 

The effective tax rate was approximate ly 26.7%, 22.6%, and 22.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectivel y. The effective tax rate was approximately 23.5% a nd 22.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt 

income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductible portions of: FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, FHN recognized $13 million of net unfavorable discrete items primarily attributable to the termination of BOLI policies offset by merger-related deductions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, FHN recognized $69 million of net unfavorable 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

discrete items primarily related to the gain on merger termination. 

A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying current enacted statutory tax rates to these temporary differences in future years. As of September 30, 2023, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA and gross DTL wer e $833 million and $473 million, respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $360 million at September 30, 2023, compared with a net DTA of $313 million at December 31, 2022. 

As of September 30, 2023, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $32 million and $2 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates. 

Based on current analysis, FHN believes that its ability to realize the DTA is more likely than not. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. A significant adverse change in FHN&#8217;s taxable earnings outlook could result in the need for a valuation allowance. 

Business Segment Results 

FHN's reportable segments include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. See Note 12 - Business Segment Information for additional disclosures related to FHN's segments. 

Regional Banking 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $270 million for third quarter 2023, a decrease of $86 million compared to second quarter 2023, largely driven by a decrease in net interest income and higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income of $583 million decreased $29 million as the benefit of higher rates and loan growth was more than offset by higher funding costs driven by customer deposit growth. The provision for credit losses of $104 million increased $61 million largely as a result of a credit loss on a single relationship and the impact of loan growth. Noninterest income increased $1 million and noninterest expense decreased $3 million compared to second quarter 2023. 

Pre-tax income for third quarter 2023 decreased $12 million compared to $282 million for third quarter 2022. Net interest income increased $65 million from third quarter 2022 driven by higher earning asset yields and loan growth partially offset by higher funding costs. The provision for credit losses increased $61 million largely as a result of a credit loss on a single relationship and the impact of loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $15 million compared to third quarter 2022 largely due to higher personnel expense. Results also reflect a $1 million decrease in noninterest income compared to third quarter 2022. 

Pre-tax income of $957 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $180 million compared to the same period of 2022, largely from a $359 million increase in revenue driven by higher net interest income. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $125 million increase in provision for credit losses and a $54 million increase in noninterest expense. The increase in the provision for credit losses largely reflected a credit 

loss on a single relationship and the impact of loan growth. 

Specialty Banking 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment of $86 million for third quarter 2023 increased $7 million compared to second quarter 2023, driven by a $4 million increase in revenue and a $4 million decrease in provision for credit losses, offset by a $1 million increase in noninterest expense. 

Fixed income of $28 million decreased $3 million, driven by continuing challenging market conditions. Mortgage banking and title income of $7 million increased $1 million driven by higher origination volume resulting from a pricing strategy to shift production into the secondary market. 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment increased $6 million compared to third quarter 2022 driven by lower provision for credit losses of $11 million and lower noninterest expense of $16 million, partially offset by lower revenue of $21 million. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower fixed income and mortgage banking and title income. The decline in noninterest expense was largely driven by lower incentive-based compensation expense tied to the decline in fixed income and mortgage banking and title income. 

Pre-tax income of $241 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $99 million from the same period of 2022 largely reflecting a $118 million decrease in noninterest income tied to lower fixed income and mortgage banking and title income and a $33 million decrease in net interest income. The decline in revenue was partially offset by an $82 million decline in noninterest expense, largely from lower personnel expense. 

Corporate 

Pre-tax loss for the Corporate segment was $162 million for third quarter 2023 compared to $10 million for second quarter 2023, largely reflecting a $226 million decrease in 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

noninterest income offset by a $79 million decrease in noninterest expense. The decrease in noninterest income was largely driven by the $225 million gain on the TD merger termination recognized in the second quarter. The decline in noninterest expense was largely attributable to a $50 million contribution to the First Horizon Foundation and $15 million in derivative valuation adjustments from prior Visa Class-B share sales in the second quarter, and lower personnel expense. There were no merger and integration expenses in third quarter 2023 compared to $30 million in the prior quarter. Results for third quarter 2023 also reflect $10 million in restructuring costs. 

Pre-tax loss in the Corporate segment was $162 million compared to $16 million for third quarter 2022, largely reflecting a $119 million decline in net interest income tied to the impact of funds transfer pricing. Noninterest income decreased $21 million compared to the third quarter 2022, largely reflecting $21 million in gain on sale 

of the title business in 2022 and lower securities gains partially offset by higher FHLB dividends. There were no merger and integration expenses in third quarter 2023 compared to $24 million in third quarter 2022. 

Pre-tax loss was $248 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $292 million for the same period of 2022. Net interest income declined $98 million reflecting the impact of funds transfer pricing. Noninterest income increased $233 million, largely driven by the $225 million gain on merger termination. Noninterest expense increased $86 million, largely driven by a $50 million contribution to the First Horizon Foundation, higher personnel expense, and higher FDIC deposit insurance expense partially offset by lower legal and professional fees. Merger and integration expense of $51 million decreased $48 million when comparing the periods. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Total period-end assets w ere $82.5 billion as of September 30, 2023 compared to $79.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets during 2023 was largely driven by a $3.7 billion increase in loans and leases. 

Earning assets consist of loans and leases, loans held for sale, investment securities, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 

Period-end loans and leases of $61.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 increased $3.7 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2022. Year-to-date loan growth included a $2.3 billion increase in commercial loans and leases primarily from C&#38;I loan growth and a $1.4 billion increase in consumer loans primarily from consumer real estate loan growth.

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

As the Federal Reserve has increased rates and reduced liquidity in the banking system, credit conditions have tightened, resulting in the widening of spreads. Fair values within the loan and lease portfolio declined from the prior quarter, largely driven by the impact to discount rates of wider credit spreads and a higher rate curve on recent loan production, which are used to value the entire portfolio. Though this increases the discount on the loan portfolio, higher rates and widening credit spreads should provide a significant benefit to overall future profitability. 

Loans Held for Sale 

In 2020, FHN obtained IBKC's mortgage banking operations which includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by GSEs that are major investors in U.S. home 

mortgages but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property. These loans are primarily sold to private companies that are unaffiliated with the GSEs on a servicing-released basis. For further detail, see Note 5 - Mortgage Banking Activity. 

The legacy FHN loans HFS p ortfolio consists of small business, other consumer loans, mortgage warehouse, USDA and home equity loans. 

On September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , l oans HFS were $613 million and $590 million, respectively. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $3 million at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Asset Quality 

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C&#38;I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real es tate loans and credit card and other loans. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate 

loans (22% and 21% of total loans at September 30, 2023 an d December 31, 2022, respectively). Industry concentrations are discussed un der the C&#38;I heading below. 

Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the Asset Quality Section within the Analysis of Financial Condition discussion . F HN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of September 30, 2023 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 

C&#38;I 

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio, comprising 54% and 55% of total loans as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The C&#38;I portfolio increased $1.4 billion to $33.2 billion as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 and is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C&#38;I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. 

The increase in C&#38;I loans from December 31, 2022 was driven by growth in the real estate rental &#38; leasing portfolio as well as diversified growth across multiple 

other industries. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2023 were in Tennessee (21%), Florida (13%), Texas (11%), North Carolina (7%), Louisiana (7%), California (5%), and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

(a) Leasing, rental of real estate, equipment, and goods. 

(b) Industries in this category each comprise less than 5% as of September 30, 2023. 

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations exist when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to mortgage companies and borro wers in the finance and insurance industry were 20% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry. Loans to borrowers in the real estate rental and leasing industry were 11% and 10% of FHN's C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

Loans to mortgage companie s were 7% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. This portfolio inclu des commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third-party investors and generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors . Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increase when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decrease when rates rise; in 2023, rates rose. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In third quarter 2023, 84% of the loan originations were home purchases and 16% were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represented 13% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of both September 30, 2023 and 

December 31, 2022, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of September 30, 2023, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represented approximately $2.0 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

In 2020, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in response to the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the PPP, qualifying businesses could receive loans from private lenders, such as FHN, that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. These loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels. To the extent forgiven, the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender is still paid from the program. 

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the C&#38;I portfolio included PPP loans of $35 million and $76 million, respectively, which are fully government guaranteed with the SBA. Due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions, PPP loans are considered to have no credit risk and do not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. As a result, no ALLL is recorded for PPP loans as of September 30, 2023, and FHN has assigned a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

FHN continues to work with its clients that have applied for and received PPP loan forgiveness.

The large st geographical concentr ations of CRE loan balances as of September 30, 2023 were in Florida (27%), Texas (13%), North Carolina (12%), Georgia (10%), Tennessee (9%), and 

Louisiana (9%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. This por tfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-perm anent financing of income-producing real estate. Subcategories of the CRE portfolio consist of multi-family (30%), office (20%), retail (17%), industrial (17%), hospitality (11%), land/land development (2%), and other (3%). 

Consumer Loan Portfolios 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate p ortfolio totaled $13.7 billion and $12.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is primaril y composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical co ncentrations of balances as of September 30, 2023 were in Florida (29%), Tennessee (22%), Texas (11%), Louisiana (8%), North Carolina (7%), New York (5%) and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

As of September 30, 2023, approximately 89% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 759 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 756 as of September 30, 2023, no significant change from FICO scores of 757 and 754, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling $38 million and $42 million, respectively. 

HELOCs compris ed $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs 

typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of September 30, 2023, approx imately 94% of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period compared to 92% at December 31, 2022. It is expected that $564 million, or 27%, of HELOCs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs nearing the end of the draw perio d are closely monitored. 

The following table presents HELOCs currently in the draw period, broken down by months remaining in the draw period.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other portfolio, which i s primarily within the Regional Banking segment, totaled $809 million as of September 30, 2023 and $840 million as of December 31, 2022. This portfolio primarily consists of consumer-related credits, including home equity and 

other personal consumer loans, credit card receivables, and automobile loans. The $31 million decrease was driven by net repayments in credit cards and other installment loans, partially offset by an increase in consumer construction loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP . For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 4 of this Report and "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and Note 4 in FHN's 2022 Form 10-K. 

The ALLL increased to $760 million as of September 30, 2023 from $685 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the ALLL balance as of September 30, 2023 

reflects the impact of loan growth and an evolving macroeconomic outlook. The ALLL to total loans and leases ratio increased 5 basis points to 1.23% compared to 1.18% as of December 31, 2022. The ACL to total loans and leases ratio increased to 1.36% as of September 30, 2023 from 1.33% as of December 31, 2022. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs in third quarter 2023 were $95 million, or an annualized 61 basis points of total loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of $12 million, or 8 basis points of total loans and leases, in third quarter 2022. The 

$83 million increase in net charge-offs was primarily driven by a large C&#38;I charge-off related to one client relationship.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient 

collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis) if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments, 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT

including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 

Total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) increased to $401 million as of September 30, 2023 from $327 million as of 

December 31, 2022, largely driven by commercial real estate loans. The nonperforming loans and leases ratio increased 10 basis points to 0.64% as of September 30, 2023 compared to year-end.

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans co ntractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $17 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $33 million as of December 31, 2022. Loans 30 to 89 days past 

due and still accruing decreased to $75 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $105 million as of December 31, 2022, largely driven by a decrease of $22 million in C&#38;I loans and a decrease of $7 million in CRE loans.

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal 

banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio were $655 million on September 30, 2023 and $492 million on December 31, 2022. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. See 

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, Note 3 - Loans and Leases and Note 4 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further discussion regarding troubled loan modifications. 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Commercial Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s credit risk management governance processes, the Loan Rehab and Recovery Department (LRRD) is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are individually reviewed for expected credit losses, classified as substandard or worse, placed on nonaccrual status, foreclosed or in process of foreclosure, or in active or contemplated litigation. LRRD has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout and/or rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate and/or minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets. While every circumstance is different, LRRD will generally use forbearance agreements (generally 6-12 months) as an element of commercial loan workouts, which might include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, release of guarantor, term extensions or entering into short sale agreements. Principal forgiveness may be granted in specific workout circumstances. 

The individual expected credit loss assessments completed on commercial loans are used in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments to quantitatively modeled loss expectations for loans that are not considered collateral dependent. If a loan is collateral dependent, the carrying amount of a loan is written down to the net realizable value of the collateral. Each assessment considers any modified terms and is comprehensive to ensure appropriate assessment of expected credit losses. 

Consumer Loan Modifications 

FHN does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the U.S. government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former Home Affordable Modification Program. 

Within the HELOC and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 1% for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification; for certain modifications, the modified interest rate increases 2% per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved. 

Permanent mortgage troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 2% for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate steps up 1 percent every year until it reaches the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Weekly Survey Rate cap. Contractual maturities may be extended to 40 years on permanent mortgages and to 30 years for consumer real estate loans. 

Within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for 6 months to 1 year. In the credit card workout program, clients are granted a rate reduction to 0% and term extensions for up to 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 

Consumer loans may also be modified through court-imposed principal reductions in bankruptcy proceedings, which FHN is required to honor unless a borrower reaffirms the related debt. 

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities available for sale. FHN maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of government agency issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations . T he securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect 

the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. These evaluations may result in steps taken to adjust the overall balance sheet positioning. 

Investment securities were $9.4 billion and $10.2 billion on September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, representing 11% and 13% of total assets, respectively. See Note 2 - Investment Securities for more information about the securities portfolio. 

Deposits 

Total deposits of $67.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 increased $3.5 billion from December 31, 2022 as a result 

of a $9.2 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits offset by a $5.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Deposit growth in the first nine months of 2023 reflects the impact of FHN's deposit marketing campaigns launched in the second quarter. Promotional rates associated with these offerings moderated somewhat toward the end of the third quarter, but overall were higher than prior periods contributing to an increase in funding costs. The rate guarantees on money market deposits in the campaign are short-term and will reprice in the back half of the fourth quarter. FHN continues to focus on building and deepening relationships to retain new clients from its promotional campaigns. 

FHN continues to maintain a well-diversified and stable funding mix across its footprint: 

&#8226; At September 30, 2023, commercial deposits were $37.3 billion, or 56% of total deposits, consumer deposits were $29.7 billion, or 44% of total deposits. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2023, 37% of deposits were associated with Tennessee, 19% with Florida, 

12% with Louisiana, and 12% with North Carolina, with no other state above 10%. 

&#8226; Total estimated uninsured deposits were $26.2 billion and $30.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, representing 39% and 48% of total deposits, respectively. 

&#8226; Of the uninsured deposits at September 30, 2023, $4.8 billion, or 7% of total deposits, were collateralized. 

See Table I.2.2 and I.2.3 - Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Yields/Rates in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates paid. 

Th e following table summarizes the major components of deposits as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities, and other short-term borrowings. Total short-term borrowings were $2.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 compared to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 . 

Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. 

Trading liabilities fluctuate based on various factors, including levels of trading securities and hedging strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Total term borrowings were $1.2 billion as o f September 30, 2023 compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in term borrowings was attributable to the retirement of $450 million in senior notes in May 2023.

(a) The modified CECL transitional amount includes the impact to retained earnings from the initial adoption of CECL plus 25% of the change in the adjusted allowance for credit losses since FHN&#8217;s initial adoption of CECL through December 31, 2021. For September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 50% and 25%, respectively, of the full amount is phased out and not included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital. 

(b) The $94 million carrying value of the Series D preferred stock does not qualify as Tier 1 capital because the earliest redemption date is less than five years from the issuance date, which was re-set to July 1, 2020 when the IBKC merger closed. 

(c) Tangible common equity to tangible assets and adjusted tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled to total equity to total assets (GAAP) in the Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation - Table I.2.24. 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of September 30, 2023, each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 

FHN and First Horizon Bank's risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in third quarter 2023 relative to year-end 2022 primarily from the impact of net income less dividends during the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio for FHN was largely driven by the conversion of the Series G Preferred Stock to common stock. 

During 2023, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation bu ffer. 

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

Pursuant to Board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN's Board has authorized two common stock purchase programs, described below. FHN&#8217;s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

General Purchase Program 

On January 27, 2021, FHN announced that its Board of Directors approved a new $500 million common share purchase program that was to expire on January 31, 2023. On October 26, 2021, FHN announced that the 2021 program had been increased by $500 million and extended to October 31, 2023. 

The 2021 program is not tied to any compensation plan. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 

10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases are subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, business conditions, and regulatory considerations. FHN does not purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior executives are prohibited from purchasing FHN stock on the open market. 

As of September 30, 2023, $401 million in purchases had been made life-to-date under the 2021 program at an average price per share of $16.60, or $16.58 excluding commissions. The pendency of the TD Transaction resulted in no purchases under the 2021 program since the Transaction was announced in 2022. No additional purchases were made under this authority in 2023 before it expired.

Compensation Plans Purchase Program 

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. The primary objectives of this program are to mitigate dilution resulting from shares issued in connection with FHN's various stock-based compensation plans, and to implement automatic stock purchases related to tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based awards. For many years, the program has been used entirely for the second objective. 

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no stock option awards remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise periods of the various compensation plans on or before December 31, 2023. Purchases may be 

made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to various factors including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. Shares that are withheld from vested or paid awards for withholding tax purposes are withheld automatically at the applicable time, without regard to whether a trading blackout is in place. If FHN were to resume general program use, such purchases would not occur during blackout periods. 

As of September 30, 2023, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 21.8 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2023. 

Management does not expect the 2004 compensation plans program to be renewed or replaced with a formal program. After 2023, FHN will continue to make automatic stock purchases by withholding stock-based award shares to cover tax obligations associated with those awards. Those limited, off-market purchases no longer will be associated with an announced general purchase program.

Risk Management 

There have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s risk management practices as described under &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; included in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99% confidence level with 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a 

Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is presented in the following table:

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 

Table I.2.21 

SCHEDULE OF RISKS INCLUDED IN VaR 

&#160; As of September 30, 2023 As of September 30, 2022 As of December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 $ 3 $ 1 $ 3 Credit spread risk 2 &#160; 3 &#160; 1 1 1 2 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHNF&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its VaR measures. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the Capital section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 

2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within FHN Financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus/minus 25 basis points, plus/minus 50 basis points, plus/minus 100 basis points, and plus 200 basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below. 

Table I.2.22 

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY 

Shifts in Interest Rates (in bps) % Change in Projected Net Interest Income -100 (4.1)% -50 (2.1)% -25 (1.0)% +25 +0.9% +50 +1.7% +100 +3.2% +200 +4.4% 

A steepening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of 0.4%. A flattening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 0.5%. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

Short-term interest rates have reached their highest levels in 15 years, which coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures, has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs. 

The yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of 2022, which has continued during the first three quarters of 2023. The inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that short-term rates are likely to peak and then decline in future periods. Market participants are divided in their opinions regarding the timing and magnitude of further short-term rate increases or subsequent rate cuts. FHN continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely. For additional information, see "Yield Curve" within "Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends" below. 

LIBOR &#38; Reference Rate Reform 

In March 2022, Congress passed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. The legislation addresses loans that remained on LIBOR as of the June 30, 2023 cessation date, and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement. Per the legislation, at the final cessation of USD LIBOR, banks may cause such loans to fall back to a SOFR-based benchmark rate, with such rate to be selected by the Federal Reserve Board. The LIBOR Act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the Board-selected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of LIBOR. 

In December 2022, the Federal Reserve Board issued Regulation ZZ, its final rule to implement the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. 

FHN has complied with the terms of the LIBOR Act and Regulation ZZ and has amended substantially all of its contracts away from LIBOR as of June 30, 2023. For most financial products, the most common alternative reference rates have been SOFR-based benchmarks. This is true for both new originations and legacy LIBOR contracts that were subject to amendment or a transition by their terms. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. After the banking crisis earlier in the year, ALCO and the Board examined the liquidity risk management framework and policies to ensure alignment 

with evolving regulatory expectations, industry best practices, and the company&#8217;s risk appetite. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels, and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources, including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal F unds markets, incremental borrowing capacity at the FH LB ($14.5 billion wa s available as of September 30, 2023), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Generally, a primary source of funding for a bank is core deposits from the bank's client base. The period-end loans-to-deposits ratio was 92% as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity, and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. As of September 30, 2023 , FHN had outstanding $797 million in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and $520 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. As of September 30, 2023, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $1.3 billion as of October 1, 2023. 

In March 2022, FHN agreed to suspend the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in connection with the TD Transaction. During the suspension period, dividend payments of FHN are not automatically reinvested in additional shares of FHN common stock and participants in the Plan are not able to purchase shares of FHN common stock through optional cash investments under the Plan. 

First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $110 million in both first and second quarter 2023 and $435 million in 2022. First Horizon Bank declared and paid preferred dividends in each quarter of 2023 and 2022. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in fourth quarter 2023, payable in January 2024. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions (including capital conservation buffer requirements) and availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. 

FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on October 2, 2023. FHN paid cash dividends of $1,625 per Series E preferred share and $1,175 per Series F preferred share on October 10, 2023 and $165 per Series C preferred share and $305 per Series D preferred share on November 1, 2023. In addition, in October 2023, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts: 

Table I.2.23

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers, including loan commitments, lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Based on its available 

liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments. 

Repurchase Obligations 

Prior to September 2008, legacy First Horizon originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the 

active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

As discussed in Note 10 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage origination, sale, securitization, and servicing businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline, estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The active pipeline consists of mortgage loan repurchase and make-whole demands from loan purchasers or securitization participants, foreclosure/servicing demands from borrowers, and certain related exposures. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with 

loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellation rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The total repurchase and foreclosure liability, which includes both the legacy pre-2009 business and the current mortgage business, was $16 million as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses, industries, or sectors. Additional risks relate to political uncertainty, changes in federal policies (including those publicly discussed, formally 

proposed, or recently implemented) and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients, and whether FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives will succeed. 

In addition to trends and events noted elsewhere in this MD&#38;A, FHN believes the following trends and events are noteworthy at this time.

Inflation, Recession, Banking, and Federal Reserve Policy 

Economic Overview 

The post-COVID economy in the U.S. has been marked by: strong inflation, which began in 2021, peaked in 2022, and has been abating in 2023; the Federal Reserve implementing a "tightening" policy in 2022 to contain inflation by rapidly increasing short-term interest rates and ending asset purchases; low unemployment rates; moderate economic growth; and a profoundly inverted yield curve. Key aspects were: 

&#8226; Although the U.S. economy flirted with recession in 2022, it did not officially enter one. In 2023 recession expectations have moderated significantly. 

&#8226; The rise in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2022 was both rapid and substantial, taking the overnight Fed Funds rate from 0.20% in March 2022 to 4.65% a year later. Hikes since first quarter 2023 have been much more modest and less frequent. 

&#8226; In response to 2022's extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy, the inflation rate in the U.S. now is well below 2022's levels. However, inflation remains high in relation to the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, and in relation to the Federal Reserve's stated long-term goal of 2%. 

&#8226; Monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time. In the current cycle, traditional inversion (when ten-year treasury rates are below two-year rates) has been both very deep and unusually sustained, with the current inversion having begun in the summer of 2022. 

&#8226; Yield curve inversion moderated in third quarter 2023 as long-term rates started to climb. Inversion continued into the fourth quarter, however. 

Key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions. 

Federal Reserve and Rates 

The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates several times in 2022 and in 2023. All but one of the raises in 2022 were 75 and 50 basis points each&#8212;aggressive by historical standards&#8212;while the 2023 raises were the more-typical 25 basis points each. The Federal Reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession. Recently the Federal Reserve has indicated that future decisions to raise rates further, or to hold them steady, cannot be forecast. FHN expects future decisions will be heavily impacted by economic data, especially inflation-rate and -trend data, available at each decision point. 

FHN cannot predict exactly when or how much short-term rates will be further raised, when raises will halt entirely, how market-driven long-term rates will behave, nor how 

those actions may affect financial markets, during the rest of 2023 and early 2024. 

Yield Curve 

Unusual yield curve effects, including inversion, are common when monetary policy changes. A traditional measure of inversion occurs when the two-year U.S. Treasury rate is higher than the ten-year rate. Traditional inversion has been sustained for the last half of 2022 and all of the first three quarters of 2023, an unusually long period. The degree of inversion has varied, but generally has been much deeper than is typical. Sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed, with statistical support, as a harbinger of economic recession, but recession has not yet occurred. 

The most recent period with deep and longer-lasting inversion was over 40 years ago. That 4-5 year period was marked by stagflation (low economic growth coupled with high inflation), followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a strong recession. 

Yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit FHN can make from lending by compressing FHN's net interest margin, and also generally reduces FHN's revenues from bond trading. These impacts have occurred and are continuing during the current inversion. Refer to Interest Rate &#38; Yield Curve Risks , located in Item 1A. Risk Factors of FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, f or a discussion of the risks to FHN associated with flattening and inversion. 

Recession 

The U.S. economy contracted (experienced negative growth) during the first two quarters of 2022, in both cases modestly. Although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession, in 2022 it did not. The economy expanded in each of the most recent four quarters. 

Recession expectations in the U.S. were high in 2022 and first quarter 2023. They moderated significantly after that. Currently recession expectations generally are mixed and mild, with some expecting no recession and others expecting only a moderate one sometime in 2024. However, prompted by the persistence of above-target inflation, further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could re-awaken recession fears and increase the risk of an actual recession. 

Banking Crisis 

In March 2023, two large regional U.S. banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows, and a major Swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators. In the aftermath of the two U.S. failures, bank investors and clients across the U.S. became more focused on deposit mix, funding risk management, and other safety-soundness concerns. The market values of virtually all U.S. 

3Q23 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in March, with a few falling about 90%. 

Following these failures, the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors. Most U.S. banks saw net outflows of deposits in 2022 and early 2023 as the impacts of COVID-19 crisis programs faded and rates available from non-bank-account investments improved. According to Federal Reserve data, starting in mid-March, the two failures triggered an abrupt net deposit outflow from all but the largest U.S. banks. Specifically, during the week of March 15, the 25 largest U.S. banks as a group saw net deposit inflows exceeding $100 billion, while all other (smaller) U.S. banks as a group saw net outflows of nearly $200 billion. The next week large and small U.S. banks experienced net outflows of roughly $100 and $50 billion, respectively. The March crisis shock was short-lived, however. During the final week of March both large and small U.S. banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits, roughly mirroring the first week of March, before the crisis emerged. 

The two U.S. bank failures resulted in Congressional calls for higher regulation of mid-sized regional banks, especially for those with $100 billion or more of assets. 

In early May a third large regional U.S. bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in March. Although this failure was widely anticipated, volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in May. By June bank-stock volatility had abated again, but with regional bank prices well below pre-crisis levels. 

The three failed U.S. banks had a few characteristics that FHN believes were significant negative factors contributing to loss of confidence by depositors, in addition to having an unusual customer mix: well-above-median levels of deposits not covered by FDIC insurance; significant portions of the 2020-21 pandemic deposit inflows invested in longer-term fixed-rate debt securities; and very high (in relation to regulatory capital) market value losses on those investments when rates rose in 2022 and early 2023. These factors made those banks unusually susceptible to a cascade of negative effects when deposit levels diminished, for the entire industry, starting in 2022 as customers sought better returns in the rising rate environment. 

Market Volatility &#38; Valuations 

As a result of the prospects for recession, coupled with the uncertainties associated with war in eastern Europe, financial markets world-wide were volatile during much of 2022. Volatility overall have moderated somewhat in 2023, but volatile episodes have continued. 

Financial asset values broadly fell last year, especially during the second and third quarters. By mid-year 2023, broad stock indices largely had recovered from 2022's low points. Values generally declined during third quarter to the point that many sectors and stocks are in a "correction," where values are down more than 10%. 

Impacts on FHN 

In 2022, FHN benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates. In the first quarter of 2023, that outpacing ended, with FHN's net interest margin compressing slightly from fourth quarter 2022. That compression has worsened in second quarter as FHN's funding rates, especially for deposits, rose more than lending rates. Although net interest margin levels may improve modestly while short term rates remain steady, margins are not likely to improve appreciably until the yield curve inversion mentioned above has ended and the curve takes at least a moderately steep slope. 

In 2022 and early 2023, FHN experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter 2020 as it allowed surge deposits resulting from COVID-driven stimulus programs to move off its balance sheet. Net deposit outflows ranged from roughly $2.0 to $4.0 billion in each of the last three quarters of 2022, and fell again by roughly $2.5 billion in first quarter 2023. That outflow trend ended in second quarter as FHN had net deposit inflows of $4.0 billion. Deposits increased again, more modestly, in third quarter. To mitigate net deposit outflows, FHN increased deposit rates appreciably, particularly in May and June 2023. 

A significant portion of the May and June 2023 deposit inflows were in the form of certificates of deposit, or CDs. A large group of those CDs will mature in November and December 2023, and another group will mature in April and May 2024. A challenge for FHN is to retain as many of those deposit dollars, and depositor customers, as is reasonably practical while moderating rates paid. 

In addition, some of FHN's businesses have been negatively impacted by rising rates. Rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the U.S. much higher than in early 2022, reducing demand. FHN's direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in 2022. Moreover, FHN's revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in 2022 due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility. These impacts have continued in 2023. 

A recession, if one occurs, likely would have a negative impact on FHN's businesses overall. Demand for loans likely would fall, loan losses and provision expense likely would rise, many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline, and competition for clients likely would sharpen. FHN already has experienced some of these impacts. The deeper or longer a recession lasts, the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for FHN. However, as mentioned above, recessionary expectations have abated in 2023. Although further interest rate hikes to contain inflation may push the U.S. into recession in 2024, such a recession currently is not expected to be severe.

FDIC Special Assessment 

The FDIC has proposed a special assessment on banks to replenish the deposit insurance fund in connection with the three large bank failures in March and May 2023 discussed in Banking Crisis above. Under the proposal, the special assessment would be approximately 12.5 basis points per year imposed on certain deposits over eight quarters, starting with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. The special assessment rate could be 

revised before the proposal is finalized in order to reflect adjustments to the estimated losses to the fund from those bank failures or certain other events. FHN expects to recognize an estimate of the entire assessment as an expense in the quarter when the FDIC publishes its final action, which could be as soon as the fourth quarter of 2023. FHN expects that expense to be material to its financial results for the quarter of recognition. 

Other Regulatory Proposals 

In 2023 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and other regulators have proposed regulatory changes that would, if implemented, significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all U.S. banks with assets of $100 billion or more. A few new requirements would apply to banks, like FHN, with assets of $50 billion or more, but by far the main impacts would fall on $100 billion banks. 

The proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements, including debt and equity capital requirements, credit risk standards, asset risk-weighting, and resolution planning. Because of the scope and complexity of the proposals, along with the fact that FHN is more than $10 billion below the $100 billion threshold, FHN is able to estimate its likely impact on FHN only very crudely. Assuming the proposal is adopted without change, and assuming FHN crosses the $100 billion threshold at some future time after the proposal is fully phased in, FHN estimates that the increase in its regulatory compliance costs is likely to be roughly on the order of $100 million per year. Whatever the actual increase turns out to be, it will be 

significantly higher than it would have been without the proposals. 

The triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure&#8212;$100 billion in assets&#8212;has impacted the U.S. banking industry. The proposals will aggravate that effect. Banks near the threshold will be more likely to slow or even halt asset growth, at least for a period. Banks modestly over the threshold, in contrast, will be more likely to expand their asset base as quickly as possible to make the extra costs more affordable. Those enhanced effects increase the incentive of banks to consolidate. 

It appears likely that, if adopted as proposed, significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress several years ago. Such a challenge would be technical and complex, and likely would take many years to resolve. Moreover, even if a challenge of that sort were successful, many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others likely would be modified but not rescinded. 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Regimes 

In October 2023 the state of California enacted two laws which, taken together, will require most larger companies doing business in California to report annually their greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, with an external assurance requirement, and to report biennially their climate-related financial risks and risk-mitigation measures. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has proposed, but not yet adopted, rules that would require all U.S. companies with publicly-traded securities to report annually their GHG emissions. The California laws include multi-year phase in periods and encompass Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. The SEC proposal has Scope 1 and 2 reporting requirements, along with Scope 3 requirements in certain situations. The California governor has stated that the new laws are likely to be subjected to technical amendments in the next year or so. The SEC proposal is not final and could change, perhaps substantially, when adopted. 

Three GHG Scopes 

Scope 1 GHG emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly, such as a manufacturing plant. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from company activities, such as from power consumed by company operations. Scope 1 and 2 emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry. 

Scope 3 GHG emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls. Scope 3 emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company, such as: vendors; employees (commuting, business travel, etc.); and customers. Scope 3 information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry and/or estimation.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &#38; ANALYSIS (MD&#38;A) 

Potential Business Impacts 

Direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data, staffing, and engagement of vendors, including a firm to provide required assurances (somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor). 

Potentially of more significance: obtaining data to support Scope 3 reporting could, depending upon how the new regimes are implemented, require FHN and other affected banks to obtain GHG-related information from customers, including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in California. If so, effectively FHN could be required to impose costs and/or inconveniences on customers. Other banks in FHN's markets, particularly those that are private and not doing business in California, could provide financial services without those requirements, putting FHN at a competitive disadvantage. 

Potential Legal Challenges 

The application of the California laws to companies outside of California appears likely to be challenged in 

court as being an unconstitutionally broad or burdensome regulation of interstate commerce, an unconstitutional violation of free speech protections, or possibly other grounds. Such a challenge could take many years to resolve. A key practical question will be whether the courts impose a legal stay (a moratorium) on these laws while challenges are pending. 

Assuming the SEC adopts final GHG regulations similar to those proposed, it appears very likely that legal challenges will be made based mainly on the fact that the SEC lacks explicit Congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to GHG emissions. As with the California laws, a key question will be whether the courts impose a stay on the rules while challenges are pending. 

Assuming the SEC adopts final GHG regulations similar to those proposed, and further assuming that any legal challenge leaves those rules entirely or largely intact, the California laws might be challenged by public companies as having been pre-empted by the SEC rules. 

Coastal Market Growth and Rising Costs 

FHN's principal markets are in the southern and southeastern United States, including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern Atlantic seacoast. Many of FHN's markets have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years, outpacing the growth rate for the U.S. as a whole. That population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth. 

Many of FHN's fastest growing markets, including those in Florida, can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events. As those markets grow, FHN's economic commitment to them grows, as does FHN's financial exposure to those events. 

It has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane events in the U.S. gulf and southern Atlantic coastal areas has been rising significantly over many years. FHN believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas. 

For example, many parts of New Orleans were severely damaged by flooding in 2005 as powerful coastal storms impacted the vicinity. The oldest parts of town largely avoided flooding, while the hardest hit areas, on lower-lying ground, generally were more recently built. As another example, on a larger scale: much of the growth in Florida over the past 50 years has been along the coast moving out from older cities. A gulf coast hurricane 50 years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area. Now, the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher, the average population in those centers is much higher, and the average value per building is much higher. If growth 

continues, in time every storm will directly impact a population center. 

This significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices. In the past few years the industry has been revising its risk assessments in coastal areas as loss experience has deviated from predictions, sometimes badly. In Florida, for example, some smaller carriers have failed, some larger carriers have left the markets, and the remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricane-related insurance, narrowed coverage, or both. Coastal states such as Florida and Louisiana have created last-resort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance. However, as the costs borne by those pools increase, either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference. In addition, those programs generally do not help business clients. 

The availability, reliability, and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for FHN as well as FHN's clients in affected markets. Instability in property insurance makes FHN's business decisions more difficult, and increases FHN's risks of loan loss and business downturn. More fundamentally, elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these markets: lower costs of living. If market growth slows, FHN's business will be impacted.
