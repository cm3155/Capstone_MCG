Recent Events and Transactions 

Merger of Equals 

On July 1, 2020, FHN completed its merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation . Reported results for FHN reflect legacy FHN prior to the completion of the 

merger and results from both FHN and IBKC from the merger closing date forward. As such, comparative income statement data in this MD&#38;A for the first six months of 2020 is only for legacy FHN. 

Preferred Stock 

On May 3, 2021, FHN issued 1,500 shares of Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $150 million (the Series F Preferred Stock). Dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 4.70% per annum. For the issuance, FHN issued depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional ownership interest in a share of FHN's preferred stock. 

On May 13, 2021, FHN provided notice of its intent to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock effective July 10, 2021. 

For more information on these transactions, see Note 8 - Preferred Stock. 

Banking Center Optimization 

Banking clients&#8217; utilization of digital capabilities to transact and purchase products and services has been on the rise, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend. In connection with the IBKC merger and the related impact of the pandemic, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the enterprise-wide digital platforms and the banking center network. As a result, FHN determined that it was prudent to accelerate banking center closures in certain markets, resulting in the closure of 52 banking centers in July 2021 and plans to close an additional 20 banking centers in fourth quarter 2021. 

Financial Summary 

Second Quarter 2021 Highlights 

Second quarter 2021 net income available to common shareholders was $295 million , or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $225 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in first quarter 2021 and $52 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in second quarter 2020. 

Net interest income of $497 million declined $11 million from first quarter 2021 as the impact of a decrease in average loans, lower spreads and short-term rates was partially offset by improved deposit costs. Compared with second quarter 2020, n et interest income increased $192 million, or 63%, driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist 

branch acquisition. Results also reflect the benefit of deposit pricing discipline and growth in PPP lending which partially offset the impact of lower interest rates. 

Provision for credit losses benefit of $115 million in second quarter 2021 compared to a benefit of $45 million in first quarter 2021 and an expense of $121 million in second quarter 2020, driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook, positive credit grade migration, and lower loan balances following the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest income of $285 million decreased $13 million from strong first quarter 2021 levels, largely as

a decline in fixed income and mortgage banking and title fees was partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income, bankcard fees and deferred compensation income. Compared with second quarter 2020, n oninterest income increased $79 million driven by t he impact of the IBKC merger. 

Noninterest expense of $498 million decreased $46 million from first quarter 2021, driven by a decline in IBKC merger integration expenses. Compared with second quarter 2020, n oninterest expense increased $178 million driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2021 included $32 million of merger and acquisition-related costs compared to $70 million in first quarter 2021 and $14 million in second quarter 2020. 

Year-to-Date and Period End Highlights 

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, net income available to common shareholders was $519 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $64 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and a reduction in provision for credit losses. 

Period-end loans and leases of $56.7 billion decreased $1.5 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 driven by an $860 million decrease in consumer 

loans and a $559 million decrease in commercial loans, largely in loans to mortgage companies. Average loans and leases of $56.8 billion in second quarter 2021 increased $22.8 billion from $34.0 billion in second quarter 2020 driven b y the impact of the IBKC merger. 

Period-end deposits of $73.3 billion increased $3.3 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020, largely reflecting growth in noninterest-bearing deposits from the impact of stimulus checks and PPP loan funding. Average deposits of $73.2 billion in second quarter 2021 increased from $37.5 billion in second quarter 2020 driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition . 

Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2021 we re 11.44% and 13.14%, improved from 10.74% and 12.57% at December 31, 2020, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 10.28% at June 30, 2021 compared to 9.68% at December 31, 2020 . 

The following portions of this MD&#38;A focus in more detail on the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the three months ended March 31, 2021, and the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and on information about FHN's financial condition, loan and lease portfolio, liquidity, funding resources, capital and other matters.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 

Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates.The following tables present the average balance sheets and the major components of net interest income and net interest margin.

Second Quarter 2021 versus First Quarter 2021 

Net interest income in second quarter 2021 decreased $11 million from first quarter 2021 as the impact of lower average loan balances, spreads, short-term rates and a reduction in net merger-related benefits was partially offset by an improvement tied to day count and reduced deposit costs. 

The net interest margin of 2.47% in second quarter 2021 decreased 16 basis points from first quarter 2021 primarily driven by an increase in excess cash. 

Average earning assets of $81.0 billion in second quarter 2021 increased $2.3 billion from first quarter 2021 largely due to a $3.8 billion increase in interest-bearing cash which was partially offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in loans and leases. 

Second Quarter 2021 versus Second Quarter 2020 

Net interes t income increased $192 million from second quarter 2020 to $497 million in second quarter 2021 driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition in third quarter 2020. Results also reflect the benefit of growth in PPP lending and continued deposit pricing discipline, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rates and spreads. 

Second quarter 2021 net interest margin decreased 43 basis points from 2.90% in second quarter 2020, driven by the impact of lower interest earning asset yields from a decline in short-term interest rates and greater levels of excess cash. Results also reflect the benefit of higher purchase accounting accretion from the IBKC merger and additional PPP lending. 

Average e arning assets increased $38.3 billion to $81.0 billion in second quarter 2021 from $42.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020, primarily driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition.

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, net interest income of $1.0 billion increased $396 million from the year ago period driven by the benefit of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition in third quarter 2020. Results also reflect the impact of lower interest-earning asset yields and spreads in addition to deposit pricing discipline. The year-to-date 2021 net interest margin decreased 38 basis points from the year ago period largely as the impact of lower loan yields and significantly higher levels of excess cash was partially offset by a reduction in deposit costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb 

management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $115 million compared to a benefit of $45 million in first quarter 2021, largely reflecting continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook, positive credit grade migration, and lower loan balances. Similarly, the provision for credit losses decreased $236 million from second quarter 2020 and decreased $435 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by an improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook, positive credit grade migration and lower loan balances.

Fixed income decreased $24 million, or 19%, compared to strong first quarter results, reflecting a continued favorable operating environment including elevated liquidity and weak loan demand among depository customers. Mortgage banking and title income decreased $15 million, or 28%, reflecting the intentional shift in origination mix toward portfolio loans and lower gain on sale spreads. Bankcard 

income increased $4 million compared to first quarter 2021 largely from higher transaction volume and an increase in rebate benefits. In addition, securities gains of $11 million were recognized in the second quarter, primarily related to a legacy IBKC equity investment.

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, noninterest income of $583 million increased $202 million, or 53%, compared to the same period in 2020, driven by the impact of the IBKC merger as well as a $20 million increase in fixed income, higher securities gains and higher other noninterest income. 

Fixed income product revenue of $206 million increased 15%, largely driven by favorable market conditions including a steeper yield curve and increased depository liquidity. Revenue from other products of $22 million decreased $7 million, or 24%, primarily driven by lower fees from derivative and loan sales. 

Deferred compensation income (included in other income) increased $10 million for the year-to-date period of 2021 largely driven by equity market valuations relative to the prior year.

Compared to first quarter 2021, noninterest expense of $498 million decreased $46 million, or 8%, driven by a $38 million decrease in merger and acquisition-related expense. Personnel expense also decreased compared to first quarter 2021 as a result of the benefit of merger cost saves, lower levels of medical costs, and lower incentives and commissions which included the impact of lower fixed income and mortgage banking results. 

Noninterest expense increased $178 million, or 56%, compared to second quarter 2020 largely driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

Total merger and acquisition expenses were $32 million in second quarter 2021 compared to $70 million in first quarter 2021 and $14 million in second quarter 2020.

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, noninterest expense increased $419 million, or 67%, primarily attributable to the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. In addition to the impact of the merger and branch acquisition, the increase in personnel expense reflects an increase in revenue-based compensation and an increase in deferred compensation expense driven by equity market valuations. Other expense in 2021 included $36 million in merger and acquisition expense tied to asset impairments primarily related to continuing acquisition integration efforts associated with reduction of leased office space and banking center optimization. Total merger and acquisition expense was $ 102 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to $ 20 million for the same period of 2020. 

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded income tax expense of $88 million in second quarter 2021, compared to $71 million in first quarter 2021 and $13 million in second quarter 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, FHN recorded income tax expense of $159 million and $18 million , respectively. The effective tax rate was approximate ly 22.0%, 23.2%, and 18.4% fo r the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximate ly 22.6% and 19.4% fo r the six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductibility of a portion of FHN's FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN&#8217;s effective 

tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. 

A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. As of June 30, 2021, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA and gross DTL were $433 million and $439 million , respectively, resulting in a net DTL of $6 million at June 30, 2021, compared with a net DTA of less than $1 million at December 31, 2020. 

As of June 30, 2021, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $39 million and $9 million, respectively, which will expire at various da tes. 

FHN believes that it will be able to realize the value of its DTA and that no valuation allowance is needed. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

Business Segment Results 

During 2020, FHN reorganized its internal management structure and, accordingly, its segment reporting structure. Historically, FHN's primary business segments were Regional Banking, Fixed Income, Corporate, and Non-strategic. The closing of the FHN and IBKC merger of equals transaction prompted organizational changes to better integrate and execute the combined Company's strategic priorities across all lines of businesses. As a result, FHN revised its reportable segments to include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. Segment results for 2020 have been recast to adjust for the realignment of the segment reporting structure. See Note 13 - Business Segment Information for additional disclosures related to FHN's operating segments. 

Regional Banking 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $361 million for second quarter 2021 compared to $286 million for first quarter 2021 primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses from continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook, positive credit migration, and lower loan balances. In addition, total revenue increased $25 million on a linked quarter basis largely due to higher net interest income. 

Pre-tax income for second quarter 2021 increased $348 million compared to $13 million for second quarter 2020. The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $646 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. These increases reflected an increase in revenue offset by an increase in noninterest expense resulting from the IBKC merger and a decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Specialty Banking 

The Specialty Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $177 million for second quarter 2021 compared to $197 million for first quarter 2021. The decrease reflected lower revenue partially offset by lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower fixed income and mortgage banking and title fees. Fixed income decreased $23 million compared to strong first quarter results reflecting a continued favorable operating environment including elevated liquidity and weak loan demand among depository customers. Mortgage banking and title income decreased $14 million 

reflecting the impact of higher long-term rates, housing supply constraints, lower gain on sale spreads and an intentional shift in origination mix toward portfolio loans. 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment increased $52 million for second quarter 2021 compared to $125 million for second quarter 2020. 

Pre-tax income of $374 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $200 million compared to $174 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. These increases were largely driven by an increase in revenue offset by an increase in noninterest expense resulting from the IBKC merger and a decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Corporate 

The Corporate segment generated pre-tax loss of $139 million for second quarter 2021 compared to $176 million for first quarter 2021, reflecting a decrease in noninterest expense primarily from lower merger and integration-related costs and an increase in noninterest income primarily resulting from securities gains related to a legacy IBKC equity investment. These improvements were partially offset by higher net interest expense. 

Pre-tax loss in the Corporate segment increased $71 million compared to second quarter 2020. Pre-tax loss of $315 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $223 million compared to $92 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in pre-tax loss for these periods was attributable to merger and integration-related costs, the impact of the IBKC merger and a decrease in net interest income resulting from the impact of funds transfer pricing, partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation income driven by equity market valuations relative to the prior year and securities gains related to a legacy IBKC equity investment.

Financial Condition 

Total period-end assets w ere $87.9 billion at June 30, 2021 compared to $84.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Asset growth during 2021 was driven by a $5.2 billion increase in cash from deposit growth, offset by a $1.5 billion decrease in loans and leases. 

Earning assets consist of loans and leases, loans held for sale, investment securities, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 

Period-end loans and leases decreased $1.5 million, or 3% to $56.7 billion as of June 30, 2021 from $58.2 billion on December 31, 2020, driven by a $559 million decrease in commercial loans primarily tied to PPP loans, as well as a $986 million decrease in consumer loans. Average loans and leases decreased to $56.8 billion in second quarter 2021 compared to $58.2 billion in first quarter 2021 and increased from $34.0 billion in second quarter 2020 primarily from acquired loans during third quarter 2020.

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio, compr ising 57% of total loans at the end of the second quarter 2021 and year-end 2020 . C&#38;I loa ns decreased 2% from December 31, 2020, largely dri ven by a decrease in PPP loans and lower balances within Specialty Banking, primarily from mortgage warehouse lending. Commercial real estate loans increased slightly in second qua rter 2021 driven by growth in Regional Banking loans. 

Total co nsumer loans decreased 8% from year-end 2020 to $11.9 billion as of June 30, 2021, largely driven by paydowns in real estate installment loans and home equity lines of credit within the Regional Banking segment. 

Loans Held for Sale 

In 2020, FHN obtained IBKC's mortgage banking operations, which includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgage loans, primarily fixed 

rate single-family residential mortgage loans originated by IBKC and committed to be sold in the secondary market. The legacy FHN loans HFS portfolio consists of small business, other consumer loans, the mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans. 

On June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , loans HFS were $977 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The decrease in loans HFS was primarily driven by a seasonal slowdown in mortgage volume, as well as a reduction in refinance activity impacted by a recent rise in mortgage interest rates. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $2 million at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C&#38;I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real es tate loans and credit card and other loans. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (19% of total loans). Industry concentrations are discussed un der the C&#38;I heading below. 

Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Loan Portfolio Composition discussion in the Asset Quality Section . F HN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of June 30, 2021 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio totale d $32.5 billi on as of June 30, 2021 and $33.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 

is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C&#38;I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, PPP loans, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of cr edit. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C&#38;I portfolio as of June 30, 2021 were in Tennessee (20%), Florida (12%), Texas (10%), Louisiana (8%), North Carolina (8%), California (6%), and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations exist when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to mortgage companies and borrowers in the finance and insurance industry were 25% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of June 30, 2021, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services in dustry. As of June 30, 2021, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

Loans to mortgage companie s were 15% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of June 30, 2021 and 16% as of December 31, 2020. This portfolio generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors and inclu des commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In second quarter 2021, 53% of the loan originations were home purchases and 47% were refinance transactions. On a year-to-date basis, approximately 58% of originations were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represented 10% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of June 30, 2021, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represents approximately $1.3 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

In 2020, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Under the PPP, qualifying businesses may receive loans from private lenders, such as FHN, that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. These loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels. To the extent forgiven, the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender is still paid from the program. Congress made revisions 

to the PPP in 2021, and may make further revisions in the future. 

At June 30, 2021, FHN had 38,075 of PPP loans with an aggregate principal balance of $3.8 billion. For these loans, there are remaining net lender fees of approximately $70 million to be paid to FHN as of June 30, 2021. 

Because PPP loans carry a full SBA guarantee, they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. As a result, no ALLL is recorded for PPP loans as of June 30, 2021, and FHN has assigned a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio totale d $12.3 billion as of both June 30, 2021 a nd December 31, 2020 . The CRE portfolio reflects financings for both commercial construction and nonconstruction loans. The largest geographical concentration s of CRE loan balances as of June 30, 2021 were in Florida (27%), North Carolina (12%), Louisiana (12%), Texas (12%), Tennessee (9%), and Georgia (9%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. This portfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-perm anent financing of income-producing real estate. Subcategories of the CRE portfolio consist of multi-family (26%), office (22%), retail (18%), industrial (12%), hospitality (11%), land/land development (2%), and other (9%). 

Consumer Loan Portfolios 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate portfolio totale d $10.9 bi llion and $11.7 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively , and is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical con centrations of balances as of June 30, 2021, were in Florida (32%), Tennessee (25%), Louisiana (10%), North Carolina (8%), and Texas (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

As of June 30, 2021, approximately 86% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 753 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 764 as of June 30, 2021, no significant change from FICO scores of 753 and 763, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices.

As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling $31 million and $36 million, respectively. 

HELOCs compris ed $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The 

principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , approxima tely 87% of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period. It is expected that $435 million, or 23% of HELOCs currently in the draw period, will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs are monitored closely for those nearing the end of the draw perio d. 

The following table presents HELOCs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other portfolio, which is primarily within the Regional Banking segment, t otaled $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and primarily includes co nsumer-related credits, including home equity and other personal consumer loans, c redit card receivables, and automobile loans. The $126 decrease from December 31, 2020 was driven by net repayments of consumer construction loans. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to recognize current expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan and lease portfolio. The ALLL decreased to $815 million on June 30, 2021 from $963 million on December 31, 2020 reflecting improvement in the macroeconomic forecast compared to 2020, positive grade migration, 

and lower loan balances. The ratio of ALLL to total loans and leases decreased 21 basis points from December 31, 2020 to 1.44% on June 30, 2021. 

The provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to or release of earnings necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of current expected losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan and lease portfolio. Provision credit was $109 million in second quarter 2021 compared to a provision expense of $110 million in second quarter 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to an improving economic forecast, as second quarter 2020 was negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Asset quality trends may continue to be impacted by the economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The C&#38;I portfolio reflects a

broad mix of categories with the heaviest concentration in loans to mortgage companies which carry minimal credit risk. The C&#38;I portfolio as of June 30, 2021 includes $3.8 billion of loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program of the SBA. PPP loans are fully government guaranteed with the SBA. Due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions, PPP loans are considered to have no credit risk. 

The CRE portfolio metrics may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel and occupancy restrictions set by state and local governments affecting the hospitality and retail industries. The consumer portfolio may also continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if consumer unemployment continues to remain elevated and clients are unable to continue making loan payments. The consumer portfolio, however, is high quality with no subprime and minimal exposure to other traditional categories of high risk lending. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net recov eries in second quarter 2021 were $10 million, or an annualized 7 basis points of total loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of $17 million, or 20 basis points in second quarter 2020. 

Net recoveries in the commercial portfolio in second quarter 2021 were $4 million compared to charge-offs of $17 million in second quarter 2020. The decrease in net charge-offs reflected continued improvement in overall asset quality. 

Net recoveries in the consumer portfolio w ere $6 million in second quarter 2021, driven by consumer real estate recoveries in the Corporate and Regional Banking segments, compared to minimal net recoveries in second quarter 2020.

(a) The increase in the ALLL from second quarter 2020 was primarily attributable to the allowance recorded on acquired non-PCD loans and the decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the decrease from first quarter 2021 was from an improvement in the overall economic forecast. 

(b) The increase in period-end and average loans and leases from second quarter 2020 is primarily the result of $26.3 billion in acquired loans and leases in third quarter 2020. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis) if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through 

bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 

Reflecting an overall improvement in asset quality, total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) decreased to $362 million as of June 30, 2021 from $406 million as of December 31, 2020. The nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loa ns plus OREO) was 0.62% as of June 30, 2021, down 7 basis points from 0.69% as o f December 31, 2020. The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs wa s 2.4 tim es as of June 30, 2021 compared to 2.5 times as of December 31, 2020.

Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because the estimated loss has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically an ALLL is not recorded.

Commercial deferrals at June 30, 2021 were comprised primarily of professional commercial real estate (48% or $78 million) and general commercial (37% or $61 million). 

To the extent that loans were past due at June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020 and had been granted a deferral, they were excluded from loans past due 30 to 89 days and loans past due 90 days or more in the table and discussion below. 

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans co ntractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet 

been put on nonaccrual status. Loans in the portfolio that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $14 million on June 30, 2021, compared to $17 million on December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by consumer real estate loans. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $83 million on June 30, 2021, compared to $100 million on December 31, 2020. The decrease included a $23 million decrease in consumer real estate loans, a $17 million decrease in CRE loans, and a $2 million decrease in credit card and other consumer loans, partially offset by a $25 million increase in C&#38;I loans past due 30 to 89 days.

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substanda rd. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio were $715 million on June 30, 2021 and $718 million on December 31, 2020. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s 

analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. In a 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 95 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a TDR. 

For loan modifications that were made during 2021 and 2020 that met the TDR relief provisions outlined in either the CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, or revised Interagency Guidance, FHN has excluded these modifications from consideration as a TDR, and has excluded loans with these qualifying modifications from designation as a TDR in the information and discussion that follows. See Note 4 &#8211; Loans and Leases for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

On June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had $274 million and $307 million portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For these TDRs, including specific reserves, FHN had an allowance for loan and lease losses of $16 million, or 6% of TDR balances as of June 30, 2021, and $15 million, or 5% of TDR balances, as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, FHN had $38 million and $42 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment portfolio consists principally of debt securities, including government agency issued mortgage-backed securities and government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations, all of which are classified as AFS. The securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. 

Investment securities were $8.4 billion on June 30, 2021, up fr om $8.0 billion on De cember 31, 2020 and 

represented approximately 10% o f total assets for both periods. See Note 3 - Investment Securities for more information about the securities portfolio, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security, contractual maturities, and securities pledged. 

Deposits 

Total deposi ts as of June 30, 2021 increased 5% to $73.3 billion from $70.0 billion on December 31, 2020, driven b y an increase in non-interest bearing deposits largely reflecting the impact of government stimulus checks and PPP loan funding.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Total short-term borrowings were $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to 

resell fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Term borrowings were $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Capital 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to we ll-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Total equity was $8.6 bill ion at June 30, 2021 and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant changes included net income of $546 

million and the issuance of $145 million in Series F preferred stock, which were offset by $185 million in common and preferred dividends, $126 million in common share repurchases, $100 million from the call of Series A preferred stock and a decrease in AOCI of $63 million.

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of June 30, 2021, each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 

For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in second quarter 2021 relative to year-end 2020 primarily from the impact of net income less dividends and share repurchases during the first six months of 2021 and a decrease in risk-weighted assets, primarily from loan activity. During 2021, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio for both FHN and First Horizon Bank decreased from December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in average assets. 

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

General Authority 

Pursuant to Board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN&#8217;s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

On January 23, 2018, FHN announced a $250 million share purchase authority with an expiration date of January 31, 2020. On January 29, 2019, FHN announced a $250 million increase in that authority (to $500 million total) along with an extension of the expiration date to January 31, 2021. On January 27, 2021, FHN announced that its Board of Directors approved a new $500 million common share purchase program, expiring on January 31, 2023. The new program is not tied to any compensation plan, and replaced the previous general share repurchase program, which was terminated by the Board. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. 

As of June 30, 2021, $116 million in purchases had been made under this authority at an average price per share of $17.28, or $17.26 excluding commissions.

Compensation Authority 

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. 

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion 

which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise period of the various compensation plans on or before December 31, 2023. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to various factors including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory restrictions. As of June 30, 2021, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 23.4 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2021.

Risk Management 

There have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s risk management practices as described under &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; included in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading 

securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99% confidence level and 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 100

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is as follows: 

Table 21&#8212;VaR and SVaR Measures

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 

Table 22&#8212;Schedule of Risks Included in VaR 

&#160; As of June 30, 2021 As of June 30, 2020 As of December 31, 2020 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 1 $ 4 $ 1 $ 2 Credit spread risk 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 2 8 2 6 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHNF&#8217;s trading 

securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its VaR measurements. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 101 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the Capital section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within FHN Financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances as shown in the table below. 

Table 23 - Interest Rate Sensitivity 

Shifts in Interest Rates (in bps) % Change in Projected Net Interest Income +25 2.2% +50 4.5% +100 9.8% +200 17.8% 

A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of 0.9%. A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 1.2%. Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 102 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 1.5% and 1.9%, assuming the absence of negative rates. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

FHN&#8217;s net interest income has been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the low rate environment. The increase in the unemployment rate, client loan deferral requests, the impact of government assistance programs, and other developments have influenced net interest income results. Although many of those impacts have started to abate, impacts are expected to continue for some time. FHN continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal F unds markets, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHL B ($13.4 billion w as available as of June 30, 2021), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's customer base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The ratio of total loans, excludi ng loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits was 83% f or June 30, 2021 and 97% for December 31, 2020. 

FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In May 2021, FHN issued $150 million of Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and announced the full redemption of its $100 million Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock which subsequently was redeemed in July. As of June 30, 2021 , FHN had outstanding $1.3 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and $520 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. As of June 30, 2021, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $1.1 billion as of July 1, 2021. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $183 million in first, second and third quarter 2021 and $180 million in 2020. First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in the second quarter of 2021 which were payable in July 2021 and paid preferred dividends in first quarter of 2021 and each quarter of 2020. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in third quarter 2021, payable in October 2021. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 103 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on July 1, 2021. FHN paid cash dividends of $1,550 per Series A preferred share, $1,625 per Series E preferred share, and $874.72 per Series F preferred 

share on July 12, 2021 and $331.25 per Series B preferred share and $165.00 per Series C preferred share on August 2, 2021. In addition, in July 2021, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts: 

Dividend/Share Record Date Payment Date Common Stock $ 0.15 09/10/2021 10/01/2021 Preferred Stock Series C $ 165.00 10/15/2021 11/01/2021 Series D $ 305.00 10/15/2021 11/01/2021 Series E $ 1,625.00 09/24/2021 10/12/2021 Series F $ 1,175.00 09/24/2021 10/12/2021 

Repurchase Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Repurchase Obligations 

Prior to September 2008, FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. As discussed in Note 11 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage business, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellation rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability was $16 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments, lines of credit, and 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 104 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

standby letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash 

requirements. Based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments. 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, government actions intended to stimulate the economy, and government actions and proposals which could have negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses. Additional risks relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect FHN&#8217;s clients, political uncertainty, changes in federal policies (including those publicly discussed, formally proposed, or recently implemented) and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients, and whether FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives will succeed. 

In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates twice and started a &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit. The effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates. These changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market negatively impacted FHN&#8217;s net interest margin. Amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Paycheck Protection Program, has offset a portion of the net interest margin decline. In the first half of 2021, interest rates have fluctuated but within a very low rate range, continuing to adversely impact FHN's net interest margin. FHN expects that when the Federal Reserve begins to reverse its "easing" strategies, it will start by reducing its asset purchases rather than by raising short term interest rates directly. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Government and societal reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption to the U.S. economy, as well as to the local economies within FHN's footprint, during the final three quarters of 2020 and continuing into the first half of 2021. Business activity, especially lending (other than lending related to home mortgages), declined throughout 2020 and into the first half of this year. In certain business lines, FHN reduced or stopped new lending because of the pandemic. 

During the first half of 2021, especially later in that period, in many of FHN's markets COVID-19 restrictions were at least partially eased as vaccine production and distribution increased. During the latter part of the second quarter of 2021, FHN saw the lending pipeline start to improve in several areas (unrelated to home mortgages). 

In most of its markets, FHN expects the impact of COVID-19 restrictions to continue to diminish over the rest of this year with further progress in vaccination rates. However, the risk of resurgence remains as new virus variants continue to be identified in the U.S. and around the world. FHN continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on clients, especially credit quality, on FHN's communities, and on the financial markets. FHN continues to reach out to clients to discuss challenges and solutions, to provide line draws and new extensions to existing clients, to provide support for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program and other stimulus programs, and to provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. 

LIBOR &#38; Reference Rate Reform 

LIBOR 

The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") is the most widely used reference rate in the world, and has been for many years. A substantial majority of FHN's floating rate loans use LIBOR, denominated in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the client/borrower. In addition, certain floating-rate securities issued by FHN use USD LIBOR as the reference rate. 

LIBOR is based on a mix of transaction-based data and expert judgment about market conditions. Before 2014, it was based mainly on expert judgment. It is published in different tenors, which are time periods such as 1-week, 1-month, 12-month, etc. 

LIBOR Discontinuance 

About a decade ago, evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set LIBOR may have manipulated the published LIBOR rates rather than using strictly good-faith judgments. Several banks were fined. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 105 

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;)&#8212;the governmental regulator of LIBOR&#8212;announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In 2021, the FCA announced that tenors of USD LIBOR will no longer be published as follows: 

&#8226; One week and 2-month USD LIBOR will not be published after December 31, 2021; and 

&#8226; All other USD LIBOR tenors ( e.g. , overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenors) will not be published after June 30, 2023. 

U.S. Regulatory Position 

In 2020, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC jointly encouraged U.S. banks to transition away from LIBOR for new contracts as soon as practicable and, in any event, by December 31, 2021. They noted that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks. 

Alternatives to LIBOR 

LIBOR became the market-preferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances. FHN believes that no single alternative reference rate will immediately replace LIBOR for USD transactions. Instead, FHN believes it is likely that different alternatives will be used in different circumstances. Although it is difficult to predict which alternatives will be favored by market participants in any particular situation, at this time it seems likely that the following alternative reference rates may be used by market participants once USD LI BOR is discontinued: 

&#8226; SOFR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) is a group of private-market and financial regulator participants convened by the Federal Reserve and the New York Federal Reserve Bank to help ensure a successful transition from USD LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative. SOFR is based on actual transaction data for the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Accordingly, SOFR represents a riskless secured overnight rate. 

&#8226; Term SOFR . Published by CME Group, Term SOFR is a forward-looking rate, with 1-month, 3-month and 6-month tenors, and is based on 

SOFR futures contracts. The ARRC has recommended conventions for Term SOFR rates, and has recommended CME Group as the administrator for Term SOFR. 

&#8226; AMERIBOR. The American Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;AMERIBOR&#8221;) Index is produced by the American Financial Exchange . AMERIBOR is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions, on an unsecured basis. 

&#8226; BSBY . The Bloomberg short-term bank yield index ("BSBY") is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by Bloomberg Index Services Limited. BSBY is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit. 

&#8226; Prime . Although traditional prime rates (with each bank setting its own) are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when U.S. banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented, for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates. 

Other alternative reference rates are being developed and considered. The alternatives listed above are those FHN currently expects to make available to clients by November 2021. 

Each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances. Despite being supported by the Federal Reserve's ARRC, SOFR appears unlikely to gain the level of market acceptance and usage that USD LIBOR has enjoyed within the U.S. Key aspects of SOFR that support this view are: (a) SOFR fundamentally is an overnight rate, and so is not easily or reliably translated into typical LIBOR tenors; and (b) SOFR is both secured and riskless, and so does not necessarily track a bank's cost of funds very well. For a bank, it is critical to avoid significant mismatches over time between its (variable) cost of funds and its (variable) interest income. Term SOFR attempts to address some of these shortcomings, but not all of them. 

FHN's Actions to Date &#38; Transition Plans 

Starting in 2019, legacy First Horizon and legacy IBERIABANK both modernized the fallback language used in their loan documentation to better handle how floating rate loans would be re-set if LIBOR ceased to be published during the loan term. 

In 2021, FHN began to notify clients whose loans are based on 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR, which will

2Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

cease at the end of 2021, and began re-negotiating terms with those clients. Only a small portion of FHN's clients have such loans. 

FHN currently plans to cease using USD LIBOR on new lending late in 2021. In 2022, FHN currently plans to re-negotiate terms with all clients who have LIBOR loans that do not contain the modernized fallback language. 

Currently, FHN does not have a settled plan to substitute any particular alternative for LIBOR. Each of the leading alternatives mentioned above is undergoing further development and refinement, and it remains unclear which alternative(s) FHN and its clients generally will prefer, and in which situations. FHN has formulated tentative internal preferences for certain alternatives in certain situations, and expects that formulation to evolve and expand during the rest of 2021. 

In addition, FHN has begun to 1) assess the potential effects for affected securities and derivatives, and 2) assess revisions to systems, processes, and pricing needed to implement alternative reference rates. 

Financial Accounting Aspects 

The transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. 

In 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The scope of ASU 2020-04 was expanded in 2021 with 

ASU 2021-01, "Scope". Refer to the Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective section of Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies for additional information. 

U.S. Tax Accommodation 

The IRS has released guidance that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts. This guidance specifies what must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

Limited Data Security Incident 

As reported previously, in April 2021 FHN became aware of a data security incident affecting a limited number of client accounts. FHN has determined that an unauthorized party obtained login credentials from an unknown source. Using the credentials and exploiting a vulnerability in third-party security software, the party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of online client bank accounts and to personal information in those accounts. The party fraudulently obtained an aggregate of less than $1 million from some of those accounts. FHN remediated the software vulnerability, notified the appropriate regulators and enforcement authorities, reset passwords for affected accounts, reimbursed clients for the stolen funds, and continues to work with affected clients as needed. This event did not have a material adverse effect on FHN's business, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

FHN has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
