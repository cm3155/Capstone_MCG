This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, as well as other information contained in this document and FHN's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Events and Transactions 

Merger of Equals 

On July 1, 2020, FHN completed its merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation . Reported results for 

FHN reflect legacy FHN prior to the completion of the merger and results from both FHN and IBKC from the merger closing date forward. As such, comparative income statement data in this MD&#38;A for the first six months of 2020 is only for legacy FHN. 

On September 1, 2021, FHN announced that in the wake of widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Ida and to prioritize the safety and welfare of its associates, clients and communities, it would postpone the IBERIABANK operating system conversion and rebranding originally planned for October 2021 until first quarter of 2022. As a result, FHN now expects to achieve its targeted $200 million of pre-tax annualized merger cost saves by the fourth quarter of 2022. 

Banking Center Optimization 

Banking clients&#8217; utilization of digital capabilities to transact and purchase products and services has been on the rise, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend. In connection with the IBKC merger and the related impact of the pandemic, FHN conducted a comprehensive analysis of its enterprise-wide digital platforms and its banking center network. As a result, FHN determined that it was prudent to accelerate banking center closures in certain markets, resulting in the closure of 52 banking centers in July 2021 and 10 banking centers in October 2021. As a result of the postponement of the IBERIABANK conversion, 10 additional banking centers that were originally expected to close in fourth quarter 2021 are now expected to close in first quarter 2022. 

Financial Summary 

Third Quarter 2021 Highlights 

Third quarter 2021 net income available to common shareholders was $224 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $295 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in second quarter 2021 and $523 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in third quarter 2020. 

Net interest income of $492 million declined $5 million from second quarter 2021 as the impacts of a reduction in net merger-related and PPP loan portfolio benefits and lower rates and spread tightening were partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing and commercial loan growth excluding PPP loans. Compared to third quarter 2020, net interest income decreased $40 million, or 8%, driven 

by both lower average loan and lease balances and the effect of lower interest rates and spreads. 

Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $85 million in third quarter 2021 compared to a benefit of $115 million in second quarter 2021 and expense of $227 million in third quarter 2020, largely reflecting further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and positive loan portfolio credit grade migration from the prior year. 

Noninterest income of $247 million decreased $38 million compared to second quarter 2021, largely as a result of a $23 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the redemption of legacy IBKC trust preferred securities and expected declines in fixed

income and mortgage banking and title fees. Compared with third quarter 2020, noninterest income decreased $576 million largely driven by the $532 million purchase accounting gain related to the IBKC merger in 2020, the $23 million loss on debt extinguishment in 2021, and declines in fixed income and mortgage banking and title fees. 

Noninterest expense of $526 million increased $28 million from second quarter 2021, partially driven by a $14 million increase in merger integration expenses. Results were also impacted by higher costs related to investments in new systems and from markets reopening. Compared with third quarter 2020, noninterest expense decreased $61 million largely driven by a $55 million decline in merger and acquisition-related expenses. Merger and acquisition-related expenses were $46 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $32 million in second quarter 2021 and $101 million in third quarter 2020. 

Year-to-Date and Period End Highlights 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net income available to common shareholders was $743 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to $588 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and a reduction in provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest income tied to the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger in third quarter 2020. 

Period-end loans and leases of $55.4 billion decreased $2.8 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 

2020 largely driven by a $2.0 billion decrease in PPP loans. Average loans and leases of $55.5 billion in third quarter 2021 decreased $4.6 billion from $60.1 billion in third quarter 2020 driven by a decline in PPP and consumer real estate loans. 

Period-end deposits of $74.3 billion increased $4.3 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2020, while average deposits of $73.7 billion in third quarter 2021 increased from $67.1 billion in third quarter 2020, largely reflecting growth in noninterest-bearing deposits from the impact of government stimulus payments, partially offset by a decline in time deposits. 

Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2021 were 11.24% and 12.64%, improved from 10.74% and 12.57% at December 31, 2020, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 10.09% at September 30, 2021 compared to 9.68% at December 31, 2020. 

The following portions of this MD&#38;A focus in more detail on the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the three months ended June 30, 2021, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and on information about FHN's financial condition, loan and lease portfolio, liquidity, funding resources, capital and other matters.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 

Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. 

The following tables present the average balance sheets and the major components of net interest income and net interest margin.

Third Quarter 2021 versus Second Quarter 2021 

Net interest income in third quarter 2021 decreased $5 million from second quarter 2021 as the impacts of a reduction in net merger-related and PPP loan portfolio benefits and lower rates and spread tightening were partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing and non-PPP commercial loan growth. 

The net interest margin of 2.40% in third quarter 2021 decreased 7 basis points from second quarter 2021 primarily due to an increase in excess cash and tighter loan spreads, partially offset by lower deposit costs. 

Average earning assets of $81.8 billion in third quarter 2021 increased $790 million from second quarter 2021 largely due to a $2.0 billion increase in interest-bearing cash which was partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in loans and leases. 

Third Quarter 2021 versus Third Quarter 2020 

Net interes t income decreased $40 million from third quarter 2020 to $492 million in third quarter 2021 driven by both lower average loan and lease balances and the effect of lower interest rates and spreads. 

Third quarter 2021 net interest margin decreased 44 basis points from 2.84% in third quarter 2020, driven by the impact of lower interest earning asset yields from a decline in short-term interest rates and greater levels of excess cash. 

Aver age earning assets increased $6.8 billion in third quarter 2021 from $75.0 billion in the third quarter 2020, primarily driven by higher levels of interest-bearing cash.

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net interest income of $1.5 billion increased $356 million from the same period one year ago driven by a $13.1 billion increase in net earning assets primarily driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition in third quarter 2020. Results also reflect the impact of lower interest-earning asset yields and spreads in addition to deposit pricing discipline. The year-to-date 2021 net interest margin decreased 43 basis points from the year ago period largely as the impact of lower loan yields and significantly higher levels of excess cash was partially offset by a reduction in deposit costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb 

management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

For the third quarter 2021, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $85 million compared to a benefit of $115 million in second quarter 2021, largely reflecting continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and positive credit grade migration. The provision for credit losses decreased $312 million from third quarter 2020 and decreased $747 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by an improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook, positive credit grade migration and lower loan balances. Provision during 2020 was unfavorably impacted by deterioration in the economic forecast attributable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and additional provision related to acquired non-PCD loans.

Noninterest income of $247 million decreased $38 million, or 13%, from second quarter 2021 largely driven by a $23 million loss on the retirement of legacy IBKC trust preferred securities and lower securities gains. In the second quarter 2021, 

securities gains of $11 million were recognized primarily related to a legacy IBKC equity investment. 

Fixed income revenues, while declining $6 million, or 6%, compared to second quarter results, reflected a

continued favorable operating environment including elevated liquidity and weak loan demand among depository customers. Revenue from other products remained steady at $11 million for the third quarter 2021 compared to second quarter 2021. Fixed income average daily revenue of $1.3 million decreased modestly in third quarter 2021 compared to $1.4 million in second quarter 2021. 

Mortgage banking and title income decreased $4 million, or 11%, reflecting overall lower origination volumes, an intentional shift in origination mix toward portfolio loans and lower gain on sale spreads. 

Compared to third quarter 2020, noninterest income decreased $576 million, largely driven by the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger in third quarter 2020 and a $23 million loss on 

retirement of legacy IBKC trust preferred securities in third quarter 2021. 

Fixed income decreased $15 million, or 14%, compared to third quarter 2020, reflecting slightly less favorable market conditions. Revenue from other products remained consistent when comparing the periods. Fixed income average daily revenue of $1.3 million decreased from $1.5 million in third quarter 2020. 

Mortgage banking and title income decreased $32 million compared to third quarter 2020, reflecting overall lower origination volumes, an intentional shift in origination mix toward portfolio loans and lower gain on sale spreads.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, noninterest income of $829 million decreased $375 million, or 31%, compared to the same period in 2020, driven by the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger in 2020 and the $23 million loss on debt extinguishment in 2021. These decreases were partially offset by higher fee income largely driven by the impact of the IBKC merger. 

Deferred compensation income (included in other income) increased $11 million for the year-to-date period of 2021 largely driven by equity market valuations relative to the prior year.

Compared to second quarter 2021, noninterest expense of $526 million increased $28 million, or 6%, largely driven by a $14 million increase in merger and acquisition-related expense. Contract employment and outsourcing expense also increased compared to the prior quarter driven by higher contractor costs tied to investments in new systems. The increase in other expense was driven by an increase in advertising, fraud costs and travel and entertainment expense. 

Noninterest expense decreased $61 million, or 10%, compared to third quarter 2020 largely driven by a $55 million decrease in merger and acquisition- 

related expense. The decline in contributions expense was reflective of a $20 million contribution to establish the First Horizon Louisiana Foundation (included in merger and acquisition-related expense) and a $15 million donation of PPP fees to the First Horizon Foundation to assist low- and moderate-income communities in third quarter 2020. 

Total merger and acquisition-related expense was $46 million in third quarter 2021 compared to $32 million in second quarter 2021 and $101 million in third quarter 2020.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, noninterest expense increased $357 million, or 30%, primarily attributable to the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

In addition to the impact of the merger and branch acquisition, the increase in personnel expense also reflects an increase in revenue-based compensation and an increase in deferred compensation expense driven by equity market valuations. 

Legal and professional fees decreased $13 million driven by a $23 million decline in merger and acquisition expense offset by higher costs from the impact of the IBKC merger. 

The decline in contributions expense is reflective of the $35 million in contributions made in 2020 mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in other tax credit-related contributions. 

Other expense in 2021 included $36 million in merger and acquisition expense tied to asset impairments primarily related to continuing acquisition integration efforts associated with reduction of leased office space and banking center optimization. 

Total merger and acquisition expense was $ 147 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $ 121 million for the same period of 2020. 

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded income tax expense of $63 million i n third quarter 2021, compared to $88 million in second quarter 2021 and $2 million in third quarter 2020. For 

the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, FHN recorded income tax expense of $222 million and $20 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximate ly 21.1%, 22.0%, and 0.4% fo r the three months ended September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximate ly 22.1% and 3.1% fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 was the result of the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger, which was not included in taxable income, coupled with higher provision for credit losses expense in 2020, which reduced taxable income compared with 2021. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductibility of portions of: FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. 

A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying current enacted statutory tax rates to these temporary differences in future years. As of 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 82 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

September 30, 2021, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA and gross DTL were $422 million and $363 million , respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $59 million at September 30, 2021, compared with a net DTA of less than $1 million at December 31, 2020. 

As of September 30, 2021, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $38 million and $8 million, respectively, which will expire at various da tes. 

FHN believes that it will be able to realize the value of its DTA and that no valuation allowance is needed. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 

Business Segment Results 

During 2020, FHN reorganized its internal management structure and, accordingly, its segment reporting structure. Historically, FHN's primary business segments were Regional Banking, Fixed Income, Corporate, and Non-strategic. The closing of the FHN and IBKC merger of equals transaction prompted organizational changes to better integrate and execute the combined Company's strategic priorities across all lines of businesses. As a result, FHN revised its reportable segments to include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. Segment results for 2020 have been recast to adjust for the realignment of the segment reporting structure. See Note 13 - Business Segment Information for additional disclosures related to FHN's operating segments. 

Regional Banking 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $307 million for third quarter 2021, a decrease of $54 million compared to second quarter 2021, largely driven by a $36 million decline in provision for credit losses benefit. Results also reflect a $23 million increase in noninterest expense largely tied to higher contract employment and outsourcing and advertising expense. 

Pre-tax income for third quarter 2021 increased $257 million compared to $50 million for third quarter 2020 largely driven by lower provision for credit losses expense reflecting improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and positive credit grade migration. The provision for credit losses benefit was $52 million compared to expense of $194 million for third quarter 2020. 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $955 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $59 million for the same period of 2020, reflecting the impact of the IBKC merger and a decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and positive credit grade migration. 

Specialty Banking 

The Specialty Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $188 million for third quarter 2021 compared to $177 million for second quarter 2021. Results reflect higher provision for credit losses benefit of $12 million and lower noninterest expense of $6 million, partially offset by lower revenue of $7 million. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to expected declines in fixed income and mortgage banking and title fees. Fixed income revenues, while declining $6 million, or 6%, compared to second quarter results, reflected a continued favorable operating environment including elevated liquidity and weak loan demand among depository customers. Mortgage banking and title income decreased $5 million reflecting overall lower origination volumes, an intentional shift in origination mix toward portfolio loans and lower gain on sale spreads. 

Pre-tax income of $188 million in the Specialty Banking segment increased $18 million for third quarter 2021 compared to third quarter 2020 largely driven by lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower revenue. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to declines in mortgage banking and title fees and fixed income. 

Pre-tax income of $560 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased $215 million compared to the same period of 2020, largely driven by the impact of the IBKC merger and a decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and positive credit grade migration. 

Corporate 

The Corporate segment generated pre-tax loss of $197 million for third quarter 2021 compared to $139 million for second quarter 2021, reflecting a decline in revenue primarily resulting from a $23 million loss on retirement of legacy IBKC trust 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 83 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

preferred securities and lower securities gains of $10 million. Results also reflect an increase in noninterest expense of $11 million primarily tied to merger and integration-related costs. 

Pre-tax loss in the Corporate segment was $197 million compared to pre-tax income of $321 for third quarter 2020, largely a result of the $532 million purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger in third quarter 2020. Results also reflect a decrease in noninterest expense of $64 million primarily tied to merger and integration-related costs, an increase in net interest expense of $29 million and a $23 million loss on retirement of legacy IBKC trust preferred securities recorded in other noninterest income. 

Pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $512 million compared to pre-tax income of $228 million for the same period of 2020. Results for the year-to-date period reflect a decline in revenue largely tied to the IBKC merger purchase accounting gain in 2020, a $169 million decrease in net interest income resulting from the impact of funds transfer pricing, and a $23 million loss on legacy IBKC trust preferred securities in 2021. In addition, noninterest expense increased $63 million largely attributable to merger and integration-related costs. 

Financial Condition 

Total period-end assets w ere $88.5 billion as of September 30, 2021 compared to $84.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Asset growth during 2021 was driven by a $6.5 billion increase in cash and due from banks from deposit growth, offset by a $2.8 billion decrease in loans and leases. 

Earning assets consist of loans and leases, loans held for sale, investment securities, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 

Period-end loans and leases decreased $2.8 billion, or 5% to $55.4 billion as of September 30, 2021 from $58.2 billion on December 31, 2020, driven by a $1.7 billion decrease in commercial loans primarily tied to a $2.0 billion decrease in PPP loans offset by other C&#38;I growth and a $1.1 billion decrease in consumer loans. Average loans and leases decreased to $55.5 billion in third quarter 2021 compared to $56.8 billion in second quarter 2021 and $60.1 billion in third quarter 2020 primarily from a decline in PPP loans and consumer real estate loan activity.

estate loans decreased slightly in third quarter 2021 driven by lower Specialty Banking loans. 

Total co nsumer loans decreased 9% from year-end 2020 to $11.7 billion as of September 30, 2021, largely driven by paydowns in real estate installment loans and home equity lines of credit, primarily within the Regional Banking segment. 

Loans Held for Sale 

In 2020, FHN obtained IBKC's mortgage banking operations which includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by GSEs that are major investors in U.S. home mortgages but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property. These loans are primarily sold to private companies that are unaffiliated with the GSEs on a servicing-released basis. For further detail, see Note 6 - Mortgage Banking Activity. 

The legacy FHN loans HFS portfolio consists of small business, other consumer loans, mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans. 

On September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , loans HFS were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $2 million at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C&#38;I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real es tate loans and credit card and other loans. 

FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (19% of total loans at September 30, 2021). Industry concentrations are discussed un der the C&#38;I heading below. 

Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Loan Portfolio Composition discussion in the Asset Quality Section . F HN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of September 30, 2021 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio tota led $31.5 billio n as of September 30, 2021 and $33.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C&#38;I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, PPP loans, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of cr edit. 

A $2.0 billion decrease in PPP loans drove the total decrease from December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, C&#38;I loan growth was $447 million, or 2%. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2021 were in Tennessee (20%), Florida (12%), Texas (10%), Louisiana (7%), North Carolina (7%), California (7%), and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations exist when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to mortgage companies and borro wers in the finance and insurance industry were 26% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of September 30, 2021, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services in dustry. As of September 30, 2021, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

Loans to mortgage companie s were 16% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. This portfolio generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors and inclu des commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In third quarter 2021, 56% of the loan originations were home purchases and 44% were refinance transactions. On a year-to-date basis, approximately 54% of originations were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represented 10% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of September 30, 2021, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represents approximately $1.4 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

In 2020, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in response to the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the PPP, qualifying businesses may receive loans from private lenders, such as FHN, that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. These loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels. To the extent forgiven, the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender is still paid from the program. 

The C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2021 includes 17,865 loans made under the PPP with an aggregate principal balance of $2.0 billion, which are fully government guaranteed with the SBA. Due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions, PPP loans are considered to have no credit risk and do not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. As a result, no ALLL is recorded for PPP loans as of September 30, 2021, and FHN has 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 86 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

assigned a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

For these loans, there are remaining net lender fees of approximately $43 million to be paid to FHN as of September 30, 2021. During 2021, FHN continues to work with its clients that have applied for and received PPP loan forgiveness. Through September 30, 2021, approximately $4 billion of the original $6 billion in PPP loans originated by FHN and IBERIABANK prior to acquisition have been forgiven by the SBA. 

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio totale d $12.2 billion as of September 30, 2021 and $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. The CRE portfolio reflects financings for both commercial construction and nonconstruction loans. The large st geographical concentration s of CRE loan balances as of September 30, 2021 were in Florida (27%), Louisiana (12%), North Carolina (11%), Texas (11%), Tennessee (9%), and Georgia (8%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. This portfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-perm anent financing of income-producing real estate. Subcategories of the CRE portfolio consist of multi-family (26%), office (23%), retail (19%), industrial (12%), hospitality (11%), land/land development (2%), and other (7%). 

Consumer Loan Portfolios 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate p ortfolio totaled $10.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is primaril y composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical co ncentrations of balances as of September 30, 2021 were in Florida (32%), Tennessee (24%), Louisiana (10%), North Carolina (8%), and Texas (6%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

As of September 30, 2021, approximately 87% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien 

position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 754 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 763 as of September 30, 2021, no significant change from FICO scores of 753 and 763, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling $23 million and $36 million, respectively. 

HELOCs compris ed $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of September 30, 2021, approxima tely 88% of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period compared to 87% at December 31, 2020. It is expected that $428 million, or 24%, of HELOCs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs nearing the end of the draw perio d are closely monitored.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other portfolio, which is primarily within the Regional Banking segment, t otaled $938 million as of September 30, 2021. This portfolio primarily consists of consumer-related credits, including home equity and other personal consumer loans, credit card receivables, and automobile loans. The $190 million decrease from December 31, 2020 was driven by net repayments of consumer construction loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP . For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 5 of this Report, and "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and Note 5 in FHN's 2020 Form 10-K. 

The ALLL decreased to $734 million as of September 30, 2021 from $963 million as of December 31, 2020, reflecting improvement in the macroeconomic forecast compared to 2020, positive grade migration, and lower loan balances. The ALLL 

to total loans and leases ratio decreased 33 basis points to 1.32%. 

The ACL to total loans and leases ratio was 1.45% as of September 30, 2021 compared to 1.80% as of December 31, 2020. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs in third quarter 2021 were $3 million, or an annualized 2 basis points of total loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of $67 million, or 44 basis points in third quarter 2020. 

Net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio in third quarter 2021 were $4 million compared to charge-offs of $68 million in third quarter 2020. Charge-offs in the prior year were primarily related to energy-related C&#38;I loans. The decrease in net charge-offs also reflects continued improvement in overall asset quality. 

Net recoveries in the consumer portfolio were $1 million in third quarter 2021 compared to $1 million in net recoveries in third quarter 2020.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis) if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 

Reflecting an overall improvement in asset quality, total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) decreased to $361 million as of September 30, 2021 from $406 million as of December 31, 2020, driven by lower consumer real estate NPAs. The nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loans plus OREO) was 0.64% as of September 30, 2021, down 5 basis points from 0.69% as of December 31, 2020. 

Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because the estimated loss has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically an ALLL is not recorded.

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substanda rd. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio were $607 million on September 30, 2021 and $718 million on December 31, 2020. The decrease was attributable to an overall improvement in asset quality. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets 

has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 94 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

the borrower and is evaluated separately. In a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a TDR. 

For loan modifications that were made during 2021 and 2020 that met the TDR relief provisions outlined in either the CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, or revised Interagency Guidance, FHN has excluded these modifications from consideration as a TDR and has excluded loans with these qualifying modifications from designation as a TDR in the information and discussion that follows. See Note 4 &#8211; 

Loans and Leases for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

On September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had $239 million and $307 million portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For these TDRs, including specific reserves, FHN had an allowance for loan and lease losses of $10 million, or 4% of TDR balances as of September 30, 2021, and $15 million, or 5% of TDR balances, as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, FHN had $37 million and $42 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities available for sale. FHN maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of government agency issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations . T he securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. 

Investment securities available for sale were $8.5 billion on September 30, 2021, up fr om $8.0 billion on De cember 31, 2020 and represented approximately 10% o f total assets for both periods. 

During the third quarter of 2021, in order to improve net interest income and moderate a portion of its overly asset sensitive interest rate risk position, FHN deployed excess cash into the investment portfolio by purchasing securities classified as held to maturity. The balance of the HTM portfolio was $304 million as of September 30, 2021. See Note 3 - Investment Securities for more information about the securities portfolio, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security, contractual maturities, and securities pledged. 

Deposits 

Total deposi ts as of September 30, 2021 increased 6% to $74.3 billion from $70.0 billion on December 31, 2020, driven b y an increase in non-interest bearing deposits largely reflecting strong deposit inflows driven by retention of government stimulus payments, partially offset by a decline in time deposits.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Total short-term borrowings were $2.2 billion a s of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to resell fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one 

year. Term borrowings were $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2021 compared with $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. 

During the third quarter 2021, FHN redeemed $80 million of legacy IBKC junior subordinated debt underlying multiple issuances of trust preferred securities and provided notice of redemption for the remaining $13 million in fourth quarter 2021. The redemption resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $23 million during the third quarter 2021, while the redemption in fourth quarter 2021 is expected to result in an additional loss of $3 million.

Capital 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to we ll-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Total equity was $8.5 bill ion at September 30, 2021 and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant changes included net income of 

$781 million and the issuance of $145 million in Series F preferred stock, which were offset by $276 million in common and preferred dividends, $272 million in common share repurchases, $100 million from the call of Series A preferred stock and a decrease in AOCI of $101 million.

(b) The $94 million carrying value of the Series D preferred stock does not qualify as Tier 1 capital because the earliest redemption date is less than five years from the issuance date, which was re-set to July 1, 2020 when the IBKC merger closed. 

(c) Tangible common equity to tangible assets and adjusted tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled to total equity to total assets (GAAP) in the Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation - Table 24. 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of September 30, 2021, each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 

For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in third quarter 2021 relative to year-end 2020 primarily from the impact of net income less dividends and share repurchases during the first nine months of 2021. FHN's Total Capital ratio as of September 30, 2021 was unfavorably impacted by the retirement of legacy IBKC trust preferred securities, which qualified as Tier 2 capital. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio for both FHN and First Horizon Bank decreased from December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in average assets. 

During 2021, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. 

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

General Authority 

Pursuant to Board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN&#8217;s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

On January 23, 2018, FHN announced a $250 million share purchase authority with an expiration date of 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 98 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

January 31, 2020. On January 29, 2019, FHN announced a $250 million increase in that authority (to $500 million total) along with an extension of the expiration date to January 31, 2021. The 2018 program has been terminated, as described in the next paragraph. 

On January 27, 2021, FHN announced that its Board of Directors approved a new $500 million common share purchase program that was to expire on January 31, 2023, replacing the 2018 program, which was terminated. On October 26, 2021, FHN announced that the 2021 program had been increased by $500 million and extended to October 31, 2023. Like the 2018 program, the 2021 program is not tied to any compensation plan. Purchases may 

be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. 

As of September 30, 2021, $257 million in purchases had been made life-to-date under the 2021 program at an average price per share of $16.44, or $16.42 excluding commissions.

Compensation Authority 

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. 

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion 

which relates to compensation plans for which no stock option awards remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise periods of the various compensation plans on or before December 31, 2023. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to various factors including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory restrictions. As of September 30, 2021, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 23.2 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2021.

Risk Management 

There have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s risk management practices as described under &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; included in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading 

securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99% confidence level with 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for the trading securities portfolio. 

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is as follows: 

Table 21&#8212;VaR and SVaR Measures

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 

Table 22&#8212;Schedule of Risks Included in VaR 

&#160; As of September 30, 2021 As of September 30, 2020 As of December 31, 2020 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ 1 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 4 $ 5 $ 1 $ 2 Credit spread risk &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 3 10 2 6 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHNF&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its VaR measures. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the Capital section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an 

increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlations to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlations to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within FHN Financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 101 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2021, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances as shown in the table below. 

Table 23 - Interest Rate Sensitivity 

Shifts in Interest Rates (in bps) % Change in Projected Net Interest Income +25 3.7% +50 7.5% +100 15.8% +200 28.0% 

A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of 0.9%. 

A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 1.1%. Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 1.8% and 2.4%, assuming the absence of negative rates. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

FHN&#8217;s net interest income has been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the low rate environment. The impact of government assistance programs and other developments have influenced net interest income results. Although those impacts have started to abate, impacts are expected to continue for some time. FHN continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal F unds markets, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHL B ($14.2 billion w as available as of September 30, 2021), brokered deposits, loan 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 102 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's client base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The ratio of total loans, excludi ng loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits wa s 81% f or September 30, 2021 and 97% for December 31, 2020. 

FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In May 2021, FHN issued $150 million of Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and in July 2021 redeemed its $100 million Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2021 , FHN had outstanding $1.3 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and $520 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. As of September 30, 2021, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash 

represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $1.2 billion as of October 1, 2021. 

First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $183 million in first, second and third quarter 2021, $223 million in fourth quarter 2021 and $180 million in 2020. First Horizon Bank paid preferred dividends in each quarter of 2021 and 2020. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on October 1, 2021. FHN paid cash dividends of $1,625.00 per Series E preferred share, and $1,175.00 per Series F preferred share on October 12, 2021 and $165.00 per Series C preferred share and $305.00 per Series D preferred share on November 1, 2021. In addition, in October 2021, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts: 

Dividend/Share Record Date Payment Date Common Stock $ 0.15 12/10/2021 01/03/2022 Preferred Stock Series B $ 331.25 01/14/2022 02/01/2022 Series C $ 165.00 01/14/2022 02/01/2022 Series E $ 1,625.00 12/23/2021 01/10/2022 Series F $ 1,175.00 12/23/2021 01/10/2022 

Repurchase Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Repurchase Obligations 

Prior to September 2008, FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. As discussed in Note 11 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN- 

originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 103 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage business, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the 

GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellation rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability was $16 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments. 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, government actions intended to stimulate the economy, and government actions and proposals which could have negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses. Additional risks relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect FHN&#8217;s clients, political uncertainty, changes in federal policies (including those publicly discussed, formally proposed, or recently implemented) and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients, and whether FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives will succeed. 

Federal Reserve Easing Policy 

In March 2020, the Federal Reserve "eased" by lowering short-term interest rates and starting an asset purchase program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit. The effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury 

securities achieved record low rates. These changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market negatively impacted FHN&#8217;s net interest margin. Amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Paycheck Protection Program, offset a portion of the net interest margin decline. 

During 2021, easing policy has continued. For most of the year interest rates have fluctuated but remained very low, continuing to adversely impact FHN's net interest margin. The Federal Reserve recently announced that it will begin to reverse its easing policy by reducing ("tapering") its asset purchases. The Federal Reserve's public comments suggest (without any guarantee) that tapering will conclude at some point mid-2022, after which no further asset purchases will be made. FHN cannot predict whether short term interest rates will be raised during this taper period or at any other point in time. Long term interest rates have risen recently, though they remain very low by historical standards. Public

expectations related to tapering, coupled with public Federal Reserve comments and concerns about inflation in the U.S., likely have been significant contributors to that change. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption that negatively impacted the economy and business activity, especially lending (other than lending related to home mortgages). The impact of the pandemic on FHN's performance is discussed further in "Results of Operations". During the latter part of the second quarter and into the third quarter of 2021, FHN saw the lending pipeline start to improve in several areas (unrelated to home mortgages) as COVID-19 restrictions were at least partially eased in many of FHN's markets. FHN expects the impact of COVID-19 restrictions to continue to diminish over the rest of this year with further progress in vaccination rates; however, the risk of resurgence remains. 

FHN continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic and its effects on FHN's clients and communities and on the financial markets. Throughout the pandemic, FHN has worked with clients to discuss challenges and solutions, provide line draws and new extensions to existing clients, provide support for small businesses (including lending through the PPP), and provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. 

LIBOR &#38; Reference Rate Reform 

LIBOR 

The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") is the most widely used reference rate in the world and has been for many years. A substantial majority of FHN's floating rate loans use LIBOR, denominated in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the client/borrower. In addition, certain floating-rate securities issued by FHN use USD LIBOR as the reference rate. 

LIBOR is based on a mix of transaction-based data and expert judgment about market conditions. Before 2014, it was based mainly on expert judgment. It is published in different tenors, which are time periods such as 1-week, 1-month, 12-month, etc. 

LIBOR Discontinuance 

About a decade ago, evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set LIBOR may have manipulated the published LIBOR rates rather than using strictly good-faith judgments. Several banks were fined. 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;)&#8212;the governmental regulator of LIBOR&#8212;announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In 2021, the FCA announced that tenors of USD LIBOR will no longer be published as follows: 

&#8226; One week and 2-month USD LIBOR will not be published after December 31, 2021; and 

&#8226; All other USD LIBOR tenors ( e.g. , overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenors) will not be published after June 30, 2023. 

U.S. Regulatory Position 

In 2020, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC jointly encouraged U.S. banks to transition away from LIBOR for new contracts as soon as practicable and, in any event, by December 31, 2021. They noted that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks. 

Alternatives to LIBOR 

LIBOR became the market-preferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances. FHN believes that no single alternative reference rate will immediately replace LIBOR for USD transactions. Instead, FHN believes it is likely that different alternatives will be used in different circumstances. Although it is difficult to predict which alternatives will be favored by market participants in any particular situation, at this time it seems likely that the following alternative reference rates may be used by market participants once USD LI BOR is discontinued: 

&#8226; SOFR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) is a group of private-market and financial regulator participants convened by the Federal Reserve and the New York Federal Reserve Bank to help ensure a successful transition from USD LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative. SOFR is based on actual transaction data for the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Accordingly, SOFR represents a riskless secured overnight rate. 

&#8226; Term SOFR . Published by CME Group, Term SOFR is a forward-looking rate, with 1-month, 3-month and 6-month tenors, and is based on 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 105 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

SOFR futures contracts. The ARRC has recommended conventions for Term SOFR rates and has recommended CME Group as the administrator for Term SOFR. 

&#8226; AMERIBOR. The American Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;AMERIBOR&#8221;) Index is produced by the American Financial Exchange . AMERIBOR is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions, on an unsecured basis. 

&#8226; BSBY . The Bloomberg short-term bank yield index ("BSBY") is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by Bloomberg Index Services Limited. BSBY is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit. 

&#8226; Prime . Although traditional prime rates (with each bank setting its own) are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when U.S. banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented, for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates. 

Other alternative reference rates are being developed and considered. The alternatives listed above are those FHN currently expects to make available to the majority of commercial clients in November 2021. 

Each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances. Despite being supported by the Federal Reserve's ARRC, SOFR appears unlikely to gain the level of market acceptance and usage that USD LIBOR enjoyed within the U.S. Key aspects of SOFR that support this view are: (a) SOFR fundamentally is an overnight rate, and so is not easily or reliably translated into typical LIBOR tenors; and (b) SOFR is both secured and riskless, and so does not necessarily track a bank's cost of funds very well. For a bank, it is critical to avoid significant mismatches over time between its (variable) cost of funds and its (variable) interest income. Term SOFR attempts to address some of these shortcomings, but not all of them. 

Al l of the alternative reference rates selected by FHN to date meet the International Org anization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, as affirmed by the rate administrator and/or an independent auditor. While banking regulators have stated that banks are free to choose the index rates they offer clients, some public s ector officials have urged caution in using the new credit sensitive alternative reference rates, primarily due to the robustness of underlying data used to derive the rates. More specifically, there is concern of 

an &#8220;inverted pyramid&#8221; effect where a large number of financial contracts could be priced using an index derived from a relatively low volume of transactions. In an interagency statement on October 20, 2021, U.S. banking regulatory agencies noted that &#8220;supervised institutions should understand how their chosen reference rate is constructed and be aware of any fragilities associated with that rate and the markets that underlie it&#8221;. IOSCO has also warned of the potential for the &#8220;inverted pyramid&#8221; problem and will monitor how the IOSCO label is used by administrators. 

FHN is monitoring the credit sensitive reference rates and regulatory guidance around use of such rates. FHN plans to limit use of credit sensitive rates to commercial loans (~2% of global USD LIBOR market) and related customer swaps (pending development of derivatives markets for these rates). Additionally, FHN expects that each financial contract will contain fallback language to guide transition from a credit sensitive rate to an alternative should that action be deemed necessary in the future. 

FHN's Actions to Date &#38; Transition Plans 

Starting in 2019, legacy First Horizon and legacy IBERIABANK both modernized the fallback language used in their loan documentation to better handle how floating rate loans would be re-set if LIBOR ceased to be published during the loan term. 

In 2021, FHN began to notify clients whose loans are based on 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR, which will cease at the end of 2021, and began re-negotiating terms with those clients. Only a small portion of FHN's clients have such loans. 

FHN currently plans to cease using USD LIBOR for new lendi ng in fourth quarter 2021. Prior to the June 30, 2023 cessation date for other USD tenors, FHN plans to re-negotiate terms with all clients who have LIBOR loans which extend beyond that date. 

FHN has developed a go-to-market strategy and pricing plan for offering LIBOR alternatives to commercial clients for new and renewing loans. Each of the leading alternatives mentioned above i s undergoing further development and refinement, and it remains unclear which alternative(s) FHN and its clients generally will prefer, and in which situations. Given these considerations, FHN's plans may change to meet evolving market conditions and preferences. Updates to systems and processes needed to implement the alternative reference rates are being finalized. 

On t he consumer side, the only LIBOR-based product FHN currently offers is adjustable rate mortgages. For new originations, these products will transition to 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 106 

3Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

SOFR beginning in November 2021. SOFR is emerging as a market standard for adjustable rate mortgages and is the conforming convention for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

FHN is assessing the potential impacts on LIBOR-based securities and derivative instruments. 

Financial Accounting Aspects 

The transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. 

In 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The 

scope of ASU 2020-04 was expanded in 2021 with ASU 2021-01, "Scope". Refer to the Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective section of Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies for additional information. 

U.S. Tax Accommodation 

The IRS has released guidance that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts. This guidance specifies what must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

FHN has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
