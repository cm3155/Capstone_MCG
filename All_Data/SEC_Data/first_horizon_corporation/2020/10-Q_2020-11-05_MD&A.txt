RECENT EVENTS 

Merger and Branch Purchase 

On July 1, 2020, FHN and IBERIABANK Corporation ("IBKC") closed their merger-of-equals transaction (the "IBKC merger"). FHN issued approximately 243 million shares of FHN common stock, plus three new series of preferred stock (Series B, Series C, and Series D) in a transaction valued at $ 2.5 billion. At the time of closing, IBKC operated 319 offices in 12 states, mostly in the southern and southeastern U.S. During the third quarter of 2020, FHN recorded preliminary purchase price allocations related to the transaction and recognized a purchase accounting gain of $532.2 million. 

On July 17, 2020, First Horizon Bank completed its purchase of 30 branches from Truist Bank. As part of the transaction, FHN assumed approximately $2.2 billion of branch deposits for a 3.40% deposit premium and purchased approximately $423.7 million of branch loans. The acquired branches are in communities in North Carolina (20 branches), Virginia (8 branches), and Georgia (2 branches). 

In relation to all acquisitions, FHN's operating results include the operating results of the acquired assets and 

assumed liabilities subsequent to the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Divestitures in this report and in Item 7 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional information. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant, unprecedented disruption to the national economy as well as the local economies within FHN's footprint. FHN continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on clients and the financial markets in which FHN conducts business. The impact of the pandemic and FHN's response are discussed in further detail in the Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends section included in this MD&#38;A. 

SEGMENTS 

FHN is composed of the following operating segments: 

&#8226; Regional banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to consumer and commercial customers primarily in the southern and southeastern U.S. and other selected markets. Regional banking also provides investment, wealth management, financial planning, trust and asset management, mortgage banking, title, credit card, and cash management services. Additionally, the regional banking segment includes correspondent banking which provides credit, depository, and other banking related services to other financial institutions nationally. 

&#8226; Fixed income segment consists of fixed income securities sales, trading, underwriting, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. 

&#8226; Corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses, expense on subordinated debt issuances, bank-owned life insurance, unallocated interest income associated with excess equity, net impact of raising incremental capital, revenue and expense associated with deferred compensation plans, funds management, tax credit investment activities, derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares, gain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt, acquisition- and integration-related costs, expenses associated with rebranding initiatives, and various charges related to restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency efforts. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 89 

&#8226; Non-strategic segment consists of run-off consumer lending activities, pre-2009 mortgage banking elements, and the associated ancillary revenues and expenses related to these businesses. Non-strategic also includes the wind-down trust preferred loan portfolio and exited businesses. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Certain measures are included in the narrative and tables in this MD&#38;A that are &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221;, meaning (under U.S. financial reporting rules) they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the U.S. and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to FHN. 

Although other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN for non-GAAP measures, FHN&#8217;s management believes such measures are relevant to understanding the capital position or financial results of FHN. Non-GAAP measures are reported to FHN&#8217;s management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. 

Presentation of regulatory measures, even those which are not GAAP, provide a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions subject to the same regulations 

as FHN, as demonstrated by their use by banking regulators in reviewing capital adequacy of financial institutions. Although not GAAP terms, these regulatory measures are not considered &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221; under U.S. financial reporting rules as long as their presentation conforms to regulatory standards. 

Regulatory measures used in this MD&#38;A include: common equity tier 1 capital, generally defined as common equity less goodwill, other intangibles, and certain other required regulatory deductions; tier 1 capital, generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations; and risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which is a measure of total on- and off-balance sheet assets adjusted for credit and market risk, used to determine regulatory capital ratios. 

The non-GAAP measures presented in this filing are pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;), tangible common equity to tangible assets ("TCE/TA"), and tangible book value per common share. Refer to Table 22 for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP measures and presentation of the most comparable GAAP items. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This MD&#38;A contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") with respect to FHN's beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a representation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. These statements often include the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "should," "is likely," "will," "going forward" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. 

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of FHN, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions, are subject to change and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements or historical performance. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include factors previously disclosed in FHN's recent annual, quarterly, and current reports filed with the U.S. Securities 

and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well as the following factors, among others: 

&#8226; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the IBKC merger will not be realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in any or all of FHN&#8217;s market areas; 

&#8226; the possibility that the IBKC merger may be more expensive to integrate than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; 

&#8226; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; 

&#8226; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships resulting from the IBKC merger; 

&#8226; FHN&#8217;s success in executing its business plans and strategies following the IBKC merger, and managing the risks involved in the foregoing; 

&#8226; the potential impacts on FHN&#8217;s businesses of the COVID-19 pandemic, including negative impacts from quarantines, market declines, and volatility, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 90 

and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 

&#8226; other factors that may affect future results of FHN. 

FHN cautions that the foregoing list of important factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements can be 

found in FHN's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, all filed with the SEC and available on the SEC&#8217;s website, http://www.sec.gov, and also available in the "Investor Relations" section of FHN's website, http://www.FirstHorizon.com, under the heading "SEC Filings," and in other documents FHN files with the SEC. 

Financial Summary 

FHN's results of operations for the third quarter of 2020 were significantly impacted by the IBKC merger on July 1 and to a much lesser extent the Truist branch acquisition on July 17. 

Quarterly Financial Performance Summary 

Third quarter 2020 net income available to common shareholders was $523.3 million, or $0 .95 per diluted share, compared to $109.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in third quarter 2019. 

Net interest income increased 77% to $532.4 million in the third quarter of 2020 primarily from an increase in average interest-earning assets as a result of the IBKC me rger and Truist branch acquisition, deposit pricing discipline and PPP lending, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest yields on loans from the decline in LIBOR and Prime rates. 

The provision for credit losses totaled $227.0 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $14.4 million for the same quarter of 2019. The increase in provision was primarily attributable to $147.0 million in provision related to non-purchased credit deteriorated ("non-PCD") loans acquired from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition, the adoption of CECL, and deterioration in the overall macro-economic outlook from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest income increased $651.2 million to $822.9 million in the third quarter 2020, primarily from a $532.2 million preliminary purchase accounting gain recognized as a result of the IBKC merger . The increase in noninterest income was also driven b y the addition of IBKC as well as strong fixed income revenue during the quarter. 

Noninterest expense increased 90% t o $587.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared to $308.3 million for the same period in 2019. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2020 included $ 116 million in merger and acquisition-related costs. In addition, noninterest expense increased from the addition of IBKC during the quarter, primarily in personnel expense. 

Year-to-Date Financial Performance Summary 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income available to common shareholders was $587.7 million, or $1.50 p er diluted share, compared to $317.9 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Net interest income f or the nine mont hs ended September 30, 2020 increased 27% to $1.1 billio n. The same factors that contributed to the third quarter 2020 increase in net interest income also drove the increase for the year-to-date period of 2020 relative to the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $502.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $36.3 million for the comparable 2019 period. The increase in provision was primarily attributable to deterioration in the overall macro-economic outlook from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, CECL adoption, and provision related to non-PCD loans acquired from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

Noninterest income increased $733.2 million, to $1.2 billion in the first nine months o f 2020, driven by the same factors as noted for the third quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest expense increase d 34% to $1.2 billion compared to $904.9 million for the same period in 2019, largely as a result of merger and acquisition-related expenses and higher charitable contributions, somewhat offset by lower restructuring and rebranding related expenses. 

Financial Condition Summary 

Average assets increased to $81.7 billion for the third quarter of 2020 from $41.9 billion for the third quarter of 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, average assets increased to $57.8 billion from $41.4 billion for the same period in 2019 . 

Average loans and leases increased to $60.1 billion in third quarter 2020 from $30.0 billion in third quarter 2019 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, average loans 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 91 

and leases increased to $41.6 billion from $28.7 billion in 2019. 

Average deposits increased to $67.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 from $32.4 billion for third quarter of 2019. For the nine months ended September 20, 2020, average deposits increased to $45.9 billion from $32.3 billion for the prior year period. 

Asset quality ratios were relatively stable at September 30, 2020, tempered by relief from both the CARES Act and Interagency Guidance. As of September 30, 2020, nonperforming loans and leases were 0.75% of total loans 

and leases compared to 0.52% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases was 221% compared to 124% at December 31, 2019. The higher coverage ratio reflects CECL adoption, as well as reserve build in 2020 in connection with COVID-19 and the economic downturn. 

FHN maintained strong capital measures. Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, Total Capital, and Leverage ratios were 9.21%, 10.25%, 12.05%, and 8.25%, respectively, in third quarter 2020 compared to 9.20%, 10.15%, 11.22%, and 9.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2019.

Business Line Review 

Regional Banking 

Third quarter 2020 regional banking pre-tax income was $155.4 million, down fro m $174.6 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 

regional banking pre-tax income was $297.0 million compared to $488.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in p re-tax income in 2020 reflected an increase in the provision for credit losses 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 92 

and noninterest expense somewhat offset by an increase in revenue. 

Total revenu e increased 95% , o r $368.0 million, to $756.4 million in third quarter 2020 from $388.4 million in third quarter 2019, primarily driven by an increase in NII due to interest-earning asset growth from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. N oninterest income i ncreased $86.5 million to $172.5 m illion in third quarter 2020 from $85.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage banking and title income increased $63.9 million primarily as a result of the IBKC merger and higher activity due to the low rate environment. Non interest income was also positively impacted by increases in other fee income driven by the addition of IBKC. 

Provision expense increased to $227.3 mi llion in third quarter 2020 from $19.8 million in third quarter 2019, primarily driven by $147.0 million in provision related to acquired non-PCD loans, CECL adoption, and deterioration in the overall macro-economic outlook from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense was $373.7 million in third quarter 2020, up from $194.0 million in third quarter 2019. The increase i n expense was primarily driven by the addition of IBKC. Personnel expense increased $82.3 million primarily due to increased headcount from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition as well as higher incentives. Occupancy expense and amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

Total revenu e increased 39%, or $440.8 million, to $1.6 billion in the nine months ended 2 020 from $1.1 billion in the nine months ended 2019, driven b y increases in NII and noninterest income. The increase in NII for the year-to-date period of 2020 was driven b y acquisition-related growth, deposit pricing discipline, and PPP lending, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest yields on loans from the decline in LIBOR and Prime rates. Noninterest incom e increased 39% or $93.1 million to $333.7 m illion in the nine months ended 2020 from $240.6 million in the prior year. Mortgage banking and title income increased $66.0 million to $71.2 million primarily from the addition of IBKC. A $7.9 million increase in brokerage, management fees and commissions was driven by the inclusion of IBKC in third quarter and higher advisory revenue and annuity income as a result of increased transaction volume. Trust services and investment management increased $7.4 million driven by the inclusion of IBKC when compared to the prior year. 

Provision expense increased to $501.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $51.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, driven by the adoption of CECL, deterioration in the economic forecast attributable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and provision related to acquired non-PCD loans. 

Noninterest expense was $768.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, up from $586.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in expense was primarily driven by the inclusion of IBKC during the quarter . 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income pre-tax incom e increased to $55.0 m illion in third quarter 2020 from $15.5 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 fixed income pre-tax incom e increased to $124.3 mi llion from $42.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Noninterest incom e increased 42%, or $33.0 million, to $110.8 million in third quarter 202 0 from $77.8 million in third quarter 2019. Fixed income product average daily revenue (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) increased to $1.5 m illion in third quarter 2020 from $994 thousand in third quarter 2019, due to favorable market conditions including market volatility and increased depository liquidity. Other product revenue was $11.9 million in third quarte r 2020, down from $14.2 million in the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in fees from derivative and loan sales. NII was $11.6 million in third quarter 2020, up from $5.3 m illion in third quarter 2019, primarily due to higher spreads on inventory positions compared to prior year. 

Noninterest expense remained relatively flat a t $67.4 million in third quarter 2020 compared to $ 67.6 m illion in third quarter 2019 as an increase in variable compensation associated with increased revenues in 2020 was offset by a $7.5 million net impact related to the resolution of legal matters in third quarter 2019. 

Noninterest income increased 62%, or $122.5 million, to $319.7 mil lion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $197.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Fixed income product revenue increased to $277.5 mi llion for the nine months ended Sep tember 30, 2020 from $162.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, largely driven by the same factors impacting the quarterly period. Other product revenue was $42.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, up 22% from $34.6 million in the prior year, driven by increases in fees from derivative sales and portfolio advisory services, somewhat offset by lower fees from loan sales. NII was $36.1 million and $18.8 million, respectively, for th e nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 . The increase was due in large part to higher spreads on inventory positions in addition to higher inventory balances compared to prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $ 231.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $173.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by higher variable compensation due to increased revenues, somewhat offset by the $7.5 million 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 93 

net impact related to the resolution of legal matters previously mentioned. 

Corporate 

Pre-tax income for the corporate segment was $327.6 million in third quarter 2020 compared to pre-tax loss of $48.2 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, pre-tax income for the corporate segment wa s $203.6 million compared to pre-tax loss of $137.1 million in the prior year. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily driven by the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger. 

Net interest expense was $69.2 mi llion and $13.2 million in third quarter 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net interest expense was negatively i mpacted by funds transfer pricing ("FTP") methodology (with offset in regional banking segment). Noninterest income in third quarter 2020 was $539.7 million, up from $7.4 million in third quarter 2019, primarily due to the preliminary purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger. 

Noninterest expense increased $100.6 million to $142.9 million in third quarter 2020 from $42.3 million in third quarter 2019. The increase in expense for third quarter 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in merger and integration-related charges relative to third quarter 2019 and the inclusion of IBKC, somewhat offset by $7.8 million of restructuring costs associated with efficiency initiatives and $3.1 million in rebranding expenses recognized in 2019. 

Net interest expense wa s $145.8 milli on and $28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was also negatively impacted by FTP. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $548.9 m illion compared to $30.1 million in the nine months ended 2019, primarily a result of the purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger. 

Noninterest expen se increased 43% or $60.4 million to $199.5 million for the nine months ended Sept ember 30, 2020 from $139.1 million for the nine months ended 

September 30, 2019. The increase in expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by a $97.6 million increase in merger and integration-related charges and expenses associated with the inclusion of IBKC, somewhat offset by $38.7 million of restructuring costs and $12.2 million in rebranding expenses recognized in 2019. 

Non-Strategic 

The non-strategic segment had pre-tax income o f $3.3 million in third quarter 2020 compared to $7.8 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 the non-strategic segment had pre-tax income of $7 .0 m illion compared to $34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Total revenue w as $6.0 million in third quarter 202 0 down from $6.8 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total revenue was $18.3 million, down from $25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decline in revenue is primarily due to continued run-off of the loan portfolios. 

The provision for credit losses within the non-strategic segment was provision credit of $0.3 million in third quarter 2020 compared to a provision credit of $5.5 m illion in third quarter 2019. The provision for credit losses within the non-strategic segment was an expense of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a provision credit of $14.7 million in the prior year. Th e increase in provision expense was due to additional consumer reserves driven by deterioration in the economic forecast attributable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense was $10.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The increase in noninterest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was the result of the favorable impact of a litigation expense reversal on expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 

FHN&#8217;s net interest margin is primarily impacted by its balance sheet mix, including the levels of fixed and floating rate loans, rate sensitive and non-rate sensitive liabilities, cash levels, trading inventory levels as well as loan fees and cash basis income. Net interest margin will also depend on loan growth, rate impact from the elevated spread of LIBOR to Fed Funds, widening credit spreads, PPP fees, fixed income trading inventory and the extent of assets moving to nonaccrual status. For purposes of 

computing yields and the net interest margin, FHN adjusts net interest income to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent pre-tax basis, which provides comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. 

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

Net interes t income was $532.4 million in third quarter 2020, up from $300.7 million in third quarter 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in average earning assets from the IBKC merger and Truist branch 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 94 

acquisition, deposit pricing discipline, and PPP lending, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest yields on loans from the decline of LIBOR and Prime rates . 

The consolidated net interest margin was 2.84% in third quarter 2020, down 37 basis points from 3.21% in third quarter 2019. The net interest spread was 2.68% in third quarter 2020, down 15 basis points from 2.83% in third quarter 2019. The decline in net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was primarily the result of the negative impact of lower interest rates (including LIBOR and Prime) on loan yields, somewhat mitigated by deposit pricing discipline, purchase accounting accretion and the impact of PPP. For the third quarter of 2020, an increase in average excess cash also negatively impacted net interest margin relative to the prior year. 

Average earning assets increased to $75.0 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 from $37.4 billion for the same quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net interest income w as $1.1 billion, up from $898.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The same factors that contributed to the third quarter 2020 increase in net interest income also drove the increase for the year-to-date period of 2020 relative to the prior year. 

Average earning asset s increased to $52.2 b illion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $36.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net interest margin was 2.93%, down 36 ba sis points from 3.29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decline i n net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily the result of the negative impact of lower interest rates (including LIBOR and Prime) on loan yields, somewhat mitigated by deposit pricing discipline, purchase accounting accretion, and the impact of PPP lending.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments ("RULC"). The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the RULC at levels appropriate to absorb management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

The provision for credit losses was $ 227.0 m illion and $502.4 mil lion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, calculated under the CECL methodology, compared to $14.4 million and $36.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 calculated under the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology. The increase in provision expense was primarily attributable to $147.0 million in provision related to non-PCD loans, CECL adoption, and the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

For additional information about the provision for credit losses refer to the Regional Banking and Non-Strategic sections of the Business Line Review section in this MD&#38;A. For additional information about general asset quality trends refer to the Asset Quality section in this MD&#38;A. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income was $822.9 m illion for the third quarter 2020 and represente d 61% of total revenue compared to $171.7 million and 36% in third quarter 2019. The increase in noninterest income in third quarter 2020 was primarily driven by the preliminary purchase accounting gain of $532.2 million recorded in connection 

with the IBKC merger. The increase in noninterest income was also driven b y the addition of IBKC as well as strong fixed income revenue during the quarter. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, noninterest income was $1.2 billion an d represente d 51% of total revenue compared to $470.8 million and 34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in noninterest income for the year-to-date period of 2020 was primarily driven by the preliminary purchase accounting gain. Higher mortgage banking and title income and fixed income revenue also contributed to the increase in noninterest income. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income was $110.9 million in third quarter 2020 , a 43% increase fr om $77.6 million in third quarter 2019. The increase in third quarter 2020 w as largely driven by favorable market conditions including market volatility and increased depository liquidity. Revenue from other products was $12.1 million and $14.0 million in third quarter 2020 and 2019, respectively. The modest decrease was primarily driven by decreases in derivative and loan sales. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, fixed income wa s $319.0 m illion, up 61% from $197.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Th e increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was largely driven by the same factors impacting the quarterly period. Revenue from other products increased 18% to $41.5 million for the year-to-date period of 2020 from $35.2 million in 2019, driven by increases in fees from derivative sales and portfolio advisory services, somewhat offset by a decrease in fees from loan sales.

Deposit Transactions and Cash Management 

Fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities we re $42.1 million a nd $103.1 m illion for the three and nine months ended September 3 0, 2020 up 22% and 5% from $34.4 million and $98.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increases for both periods were primarily volume-related from the addition of IBKC and were partially offset by a decline in NSF fees from pandemic-related impacts such as a decline in transaction volume and fee waivers. For the year-to-date period, a $4.6 million debit card incentive payment recognized in second quarter 2020 also contributed to the increase in deposit transaction and cash management fees. 

Brokerage, Management Fees and Commissions 

Noninterest income from brokerage, management fees and commissions was $ 17.9 million and $47.1 million for the three and nine m onths e nded September 30, 2020 compared to $14.2 million and $40.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for both periods was primarily driven by the inclusion of IBKC and increased annuity income from higher transaction activity, and for the year-to-date period, higher advisory income. 

Mortgage Banking and Title Income 

Mortgage banking and title income was $65.5 million and $72.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $2.0 million and $6.5 million for the same periods of 2019. The increases were largely the result of the added revenue stream from the IBKC merger and higher activity due to the low rate environment. 

Trust Services and Investment Management 

Trust services and investment management was $11.7 million and $26.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $7.2 million and $22.1 million for the same periods in 2019. The increase for both periods was primarily the inclusion of IBKC in the third quarter. 

Bankcard Income 

Bankcard income was $10.5 million and $24.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $7.0 million and $20.3 million for the same periods in 2019. The increase for both periods was primarily the result of the inclusion of IBKC in the third quarter. 

Other Nonintere st Income 

Revenue from all other incom e increased $4.1 mi llion to $33.4 m illion in third quarter 2020 from $29.3 million in third quarter 2019. The increase in all other income in the third quarter 2020 was largely due to a $3.4 million increase in deferred compensation income driven by equity market valuations relative to the prior year. Deferred compensation income fluctuates wit h changes in the market value of the underlying investments and is mirrored by changes in deferred compensation expense which is included in personnel expense. Additionally, an increase in other service charges contributed to the increase in all other income in third quarter 2020, but was partially offset by a decrease in interest rate swap income relative to third quarter 2019. The increase in other service charges was primarily merger-related. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 revenue from all other incom e decreased $2.5 million to $82.1 million from $84.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Significant declines in all other income in third quarter 2020 included a $5.4 million decrease in deferred compensation income . The decline in deferred compensation income was driven by the timing of and extreme variability in equity market valuations in both 2020 and 2019. In addition, all other income declined in third quarter of 2020 from collections on fully-charged off CBF loans and gains on sales of fixed assets in the prior year. Increases in fees from derivative sales, income from other services charges and BOLI income offset a portion of the overall decline in other noninterest income.

Noninterest Expense 

Total noninterest expense increased $278.7 million, or 90%, to $587.0 million in third quarter 2020 from $308.3 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 noninterest expense increased 34% to $1.2 billion fr om $904.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in noninterest expense for the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2020 was primarily attributable to increases from the addition of IBKC as well as merger and acquisition-related expenses. Contributions expense increased $39.2 million for the quarterly period and $39.4 million for the year-to-date period. The increased contributions expense was reflective of a $20 million contribution to the Louisiana First Horizon Foundation in connection with the IBKC merger and a $15 million donation of Paycheck Protection Plan fees to the First Horizon Foundation to assist low- and moderate-income communities. 

Personnel Expense 

Personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest ex pense, increased $162.4 million in third quarter 2020 to $329.4 million from $167.0 million in third quarter 2019. The increase in personnel expense in third quarter 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in headcount associated with the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition, higher variable compensation due to higher fixed income sales revenue, and increases in deferred compensation expense driven by equity market valuations 

and acquisition-related costs. In addition, personnel expense included $34.9 million in merger and acquisition-related expenses during the current quarter. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 personnel expense was $713.2 million , up $196.6 mi llion from $516.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in personnel expense for the year-to-date period was driven by higher headcount from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition, merger and acquisition-related expense, and higher variable compensation due to increased revenues within Fixed Income. For the year-to-date period of 2020, deferred compensation expense decreased $6.9 million driven by the timing of and extreme variability in equity market valuations in both 2020 and 2019. Additionally, a decrease in restructuring costs also offset a portion of the overall increase in personnel expenses for the nine months ended 2020. 

Legal and Professional Fees 

Legal and professional fees we re $43.2 million in third quarter 2020, an increase of $23.5 million fr om $19.8 million in third quarter 2019. The increase in legal and professional fees was primarily driven by an increase in merger and integration-related expenses and the inclusion of IBKC, somewhat offset by $6.5 million of restructuring costs associated with efficiency initiatives recognized in third quarter 2019. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 99 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, legal and professional fees were $64.9 million, an increase of $12.2 million compared to the same period in 2019. The increase for the year-to-date period was the result of an increase in merger and integration-related expenses and the inclusion of IBKC, partially offset by lower restructuring costs associated with efficiency initiatives recognized in 2019. Additionally, strategic investments recognized in the first quarter of 2019 to analyze growth potential and product mix for new markets contributed to a year-over-year decline in professional fees. 

Other Noninterest Expense 

All other expens es increased 11% to $68.1 mi llion in third quarter 2020 from $61.2 million in third quarter 2019. Miscellaneous loans costs increased $5.2 million, communications and delivery increased $4.0 million, contract employment and outsourcing increased $2.7 million and FDIC premium expense increased $2.6 million . These increases were offset by a decrease in advertising and public relations expense largely due to promotional branding campaigns and target marketing in new markets in 2019. 

All other expenses increased 7% to $161.0 mi llion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $150.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. FDIC premium expense increased $7.3 million, largely due to the addition of IBKC as well as balance sheet growth and expected loss severity ratios. Miscellaneous loan costs increased $6.7 million, primarily from the inclusion of IBKC. Contract employment and outsourcing increased $6.4 million from technology-related projects as well as merger and integration-related expense. Pension-related costs increased $6.3 million primarily from the change in the expected rate of return on plan assets and interest cost due to the discount rate. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in asset impairments and technology related costs associated with restructuring and rebranding initiatives recognized in 2019. The decline in advertising and public relations expense was largely due to promotional branding campaigns and target marketing in new markets in 2019.

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded an income tax provision of $2.2 m illion in third quarter 2020, compared to $35.8 million in third quarter 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, FHN recorded an income tax provision of $ 19.8 million and $97.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was approximate ly 0.4% and 3% compared to 24% and 23% for the three and nine months ended 

September 30, 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was the result of the preliminary purchase accounting gain from the IBKC merger, which is not taxable. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and credits and other tax benefits from affordable housing investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductibility of a portion of FHN's FDIC premium and executive compensation expenses. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 100 

FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. 

A deferred tax asset (&#8220;DTA&#8221;) or deferred tax liability (&#8220;DTL&#8221;) is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. As of September 30, 2020, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA (net of a valuation allowance) and gross DTL were $454.9 million and $409.8 million, respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $ 45.1 m illion at September 30, 2020, compared with a net DTA of $69.0 million at December 31, 2019. 

As of September 30, 2020, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $47.4 million and $8.9 m illion, respectively, which will expire at various dates. 

FHN believes that it will be able to realize the value of its DTA and that no valuation allowance is needed. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 

Restructuring, Repositioning, and Efficiency Initiatives 

Beginning in 2019, FHN initiated a company-wide review of business practices with the goal of optimizing its expense base to improve profitability and create capacity to reinvest savings into technology and revenue production activities. The net charges for restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency initiatives were not significant in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and were $38.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These expenses are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs, professional fees, and costs associated with asset impairments. Due to the broad nature of the actions being taken, many components of expense are expected to benefit from the current efficiency initiatives. See Note 18 - Restructuring, Repositioning, and Efficiency for additional information. 

Financial Condition 

Total period-end assets were$83.0 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $43.3 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the IBKC merger and the Truist branch acquisition. 

Earning assets consist of loans, investment securities, loans held for sale, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 

Period-end loans and leases increased $28.6 billion, or 92% to $59.7 billion as of September 30, 2020 from $31.1 billion on December 31, 2019, driven by both $26.3 billion in acquired loans and leases and PPP lending. A verage loans and leas es increased $29.4 billion to $60.1 billion in third quarter 2020 compared to $30.7 billion in fourth quarter 2019 and $30.0 billion in third quarter 2019.

(a) Balance for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 includes $7.1 million of restricted and secured real estate loans. 

(b) In first quarter 2020, the Permanent Mortgage portfolio was combined into Consumer Real Estate portfolio, all prior periods were revised for comparability. 

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio, comprising 57% of total loans in third quarter 2020 and 64% in fourth quarter 2019. C&#38;I loa ns increased 72% from fourth quarter 2019, largely dri ven by acquired loans from IBKC and Truist Bank, PPP lending and higher balances within mortgage warehouse lending. Driven by acquired IBKC loans, commercial real estate loans increased 191% to $12.4 b illion in third quarter 2020. 

Average consumer loans increased 104% from fourth quarter 2019 to $13.7 billion in third quarter 2020, largely driven by acquired loans. 

Loans Held for Sale 

On July 1, 2020 as part of the IBKC merger, FHN acquired a portfolio of loans held for sale which primarily consist of fixed rate single-family residential mortgage loans originated by IBKC and committed to be sold in the secondary market. The legacy FHN loans HFS portfolio consists of small business, other consumer loans, the mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans. On September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, loans HFS were $1.1 billion and $593.8 million, respectively. The average balance of loans HFS increased to $984.9 million in third quarter 2020 from $581.8 million in fourth quarter 2019. The increase in period-end and average loans HFS was primarily driven by the acquired IBKC HFS loans, somewhat offset by a decrease in small business l oans. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $2.4 million and $6.8 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment portfolio consists principally of debt securities, including government agency issued mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) and government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;), all of which are classified as available for sale. FHN utilizes the securities portfolio as a source of income, liquidity and collateral for repurchase agreements, for public funds, and as a tool for managing risk of interest rate movements. Period-end investment securities were $8.0 billion on September 30, 202 0 up fr om $4.4 billion on December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of securities acquired from the IBKC merger. 

Average investment securities were $8.6 billion in third quarter 2020 and $4.4 b illion in fourth quarter 2019, representing 11% and 12% of average earning assets, respectively. The increase in average investment securities was also driven by the IBKC merger. FHN manages the size and mix of the investment portfolio to assist in asset liability management, provide liquidity, and optimize risk adjusted return. 

Deposits 

Period-end deposi ts increased to $68.4 b illion on September 30, 2020, from $32.4 billion on December 31, 2019. Average depos its increased to $67.1 billion in third quarter 2020, from $32.8 billion in fourth quarter 2019 and $32.4 billion in third quarter 2019. The increase in both period-end and average balances was largely the result of the IBKC merger and the Truist branch acquisitio n. In 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 102 

addition, deposit balances were impacted by significant customer deposit inflows beginning in March 2020 as brokerage customers exited equity markets to move in cash positions given the market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, municipalities received federal stimulus payments, and PPP funding began, as well as management&#8217;s decision in first quarter 2020 to increase market-indexed deposits (given the favorable benefits of this funding source in lower interest-rate environments). As short-term rates have come down, particularly in the third quarter, bank deposits provide institutional clients 

with overnight liquidity at a competitive, and often superior, rate to other short-term cash management options. Additionally, there has been a notable shift from interest-bearing deposits to non-interest bearing deposits within many of FHN's institutional relationships. The influx in noninterest-bearing deposits during the n ine months ended September 30, 2020 resulted in a n increase in the percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits from 26% of total deposits in fourth quarter 2019 to 31% of total deposits in third quarter 2020. 

Th e following table summarizes FHN's average deposits for quarters ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Period-end short-term borrowings decreased 35% to $2.6 bi llion on September 30, 2020 from $4.0 billion on December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by a decrease in other short-term borrowings, as FHN was able to use customer deposits to support balance sheet funding. The decrease in other short-term borrowings was somewhat offset by increases in securities purchased under agreements to resell and federal funds purchased. 

Short-term borrowings averaged $2.8 b illion in third quarter 2020, down 14% from $3.3 billion in fourth quarter 2019. As noted in the table below, the decrease in short-term borrowings between fourth quarter 2019 and third quarter 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in other 

short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased and trading liabilities, partially offset by an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Other short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Trading liabilities fluctuate based on various factors including variations in levels of trading securities. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to resell fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions.

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Period-end term borrowings were $2.2 billi on on September 30, 2020, up from $.8 billion on December 31, 2019. Average term borrowings wer e $2.2 billion in third quarter 2020 and $.9 billion in fourth quarter 2019. The 

increase in term borrowings on both an average and period-end basis was the result of the issuance of $450 million of subordinated notes by First Horizon Bank in April 2020, and the issuance of $800 million of senior notes by FHN in May 2020. 

Capital 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to we ll-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Period-end equity was $8.1 bill ion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2019. Average equity increased to $8.1 bil lion in third quarter 2020 from $5.0 billion in fourth quarter 2019. Equity issued in connection 

with the IBKC merger was $2.5 billion. In addition, FHN issued 1,500 shares of Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in May 2020 for net proceeds of $144.7 million. Other significant changes included net income of $612.2 million and an increase in AOCI of $99.1 million, which were partially offset by $195.0 million for common and preferred dividends and $96.1 million related to the adoption of CECL.

(a) The modified CECL transitional amount is calculated as defined in the final rule issued by the banking regulators on August 26, 2020 and includes the full amount of the impact to retained earnings from the initial adoption of CECL plus 25% of the change in the adjusted allowance for credit losses (&#8220;AACL&#8221;) since FHN&#8217;s initial adoption of CECL through September 30, 2020. 

(b) The $96.3 million carrying value of the Series D preferred stock does not qualify as Tier 1 capital because the earliest redemption date is less than five years from the issuance date. 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s 

capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, beginning January 1, 2019, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 105 

points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of September 30, 2020, each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. The third quarter 2020 capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in late August 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in third quarter 2020 relative to fourth quarter 2019 primarily from the issuance of preferred and common equity in connection with the IBKC merger, offset by the intangible assets created in the IBKC merger and Truist Bank branch acquisition. Regulatory capital ratios were also favorably impacted by the impact of net income less dividends during the first nine months of 2020. For the Bank only, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios were impacted by a reduction of $115 million in its equity investment in its financial subsidiary, FHN Financial Securities Corp. In addition, the Tier 1 Capital ratio for FHN benefited from the issuance of $150 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. The Total Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank benefited from the Bank&#8217;s issuance of $450 million of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated notes. The Tier 1 leverage ratio declined for both FHNC and First Horizon Bank as average assets for leverage in the third quarter 2020 increased relative to fourth quarter 2019 primarily in connection with the IBKC merger. During 2020, capital 

ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. 

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

Pursuant to board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Two common stock purchase programs currently authorized are discussed below. FHN&#8217;s board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

General Authority 

On January 23, 2018, FHN announced a $250 million share purchase authority with an expiration date of January 31, 2020. On January 29, 2019, FHN announced a $250 million increase in that authority along with an extension of the expiration date to January 31, 2021. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, prudent capital management, and legal and regulatory restrictions. As of September 30, 2020, $229.3 million in purchases had been made under this authority at an average price per share of $15.09, or $15.07 excluding commissions. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2020.

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. 

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program, inclusive of a program amendment on April 24, 2006, is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option

Asset Quality 

Loan Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans are composed of commercial, financial, and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) and commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;). Consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate; and credit card and other. In first quarter 2020, FHN consolidated its permanent mortgage portfolio into consumer real estate. Loans previously classified in permanent mortgage included p rimarily jumbo mortgages and one-time-close (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) completed construction loans in the non-strategic segment that were originated through pre-2009 mortgage businesses. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (21% of total loans). Industry concentrations are discussed under the heading C&#38;I below. 

Consolidated key asset quality metrics for each of these portfolios can be fou nd in Table 16 &#8211; Asset Q uality by Portfolio. Credit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, in the Loan Portfolio Composition discussion in the Asset Quality Section beginning on pa ge 67 and continuing to page 87. F HN&#8217;s 

credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of September 30, 2020, are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio was $33.7 billion on September 30, 2020, and is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Typical products include working capital lines of credit, term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, direct financing and sales-type leases, and trade credit enhancement through letters of cr edit. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of September 30, 2020, are in Tennessee (22%), Florida (11%), Texas (10%), Louisiana (8%), North Carolina (8%), California (6%), Georgia (5%), and Alabama (4%), with no other state representing more than 3% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the comp osition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (&#8220;NAICS&#8221;) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. 26% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loans are loans to mortgage companies or borrowers in the finance and insurance industry and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services in dustry. Except &#8220;Finance and Insurance&#8221; and &#8220;Loans to Mortgage Companies&#8221;, as discussed below, on September 30, 2020, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

The balance of loans to mortgage companie s was 17% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2020, 22% as of December 31, 2019 and 25% as of September 30, 2019, and includes balances related to both home purchase and refinance activity. This portfolio class, which generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors, includes commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, lending to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In third quarter 2020, 40% of the loans funded were home purchases and 60% were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represen ts 9% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2020 compared to 14% as of December 31, 2019, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long- 

term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of September 30, 2020, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represents ap proximately $1.1 billion o f the finance and insurance component. 

TRUPs lending was originally extended as a form of &#8220;bridge&#8221; financing to participants in the pooled trust preferred securitization program offered primarily to smaller banking (generally less than $15 billion in total assets) and insurance institutions through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business. Origination of TRUPs lending ceased in early 2008. Individual TRUPs are re-graded at least quarterly as part of FHN&#8217;s commercial loan review process. The terms of these loans generally include a scheduled 30 year balloon payoff and include an option to defer interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters. As of September 30, 2020, no TRUP relationship was on interest deferral. As of September 30, 2020, the unpaid principal balance (&#8220;UPB&#8221;) of trust preferred loans total ed $227.6 million. Inclusive of an amortizing discount on TRUPs of $18.2 m illion, total reserves (ALLL plus the amortizing discount) for TRUPs and other bank-related loans were $28.5 million, or 13% of ou tstanding UPB. 

C&#38;I Asset Quality Trends 

The C&#38;I portfolio trends have been negatively impacted in the third quarter 2020 by economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and could continue to be negatively impacted in future periods. The C&#38;I AL LL increased $366.6 m illion from December 31, 2019, to $489.1 m illion as of September 30, 2020, primarily due to the steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial allowance recorded on PCD loans, and the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 108 

The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans inc reased 84 b asis points to 1.45% as of September 30, 2020, compared to .61% as of year-end 2019. 

Nonperforming C&#38;I loans inc reased $138.5 million from December 31, 2019, to $212.8 million on September 30, 2020. The nonperforming loan (&#8220;NPL&#8221;) ratio increased to 0.63% of C&#38;I loans as of September 30, 2020, from 0.37% as of December 31, 2019. The increase in NPLs was primarily driven by acquired NPLs from IBKC. 

The 30+ delinquency ratio increased one basis point as of September 30, 2020. Net charge-offs in third quarter 2020 were $66.2 million compared to $3.3 m illion and $15.4 million of net charge-offs in fourth quarter 2019 and third quarter 2019, respectively. Third quarter 2020 net charge-offs were primarily driven by losses in the energy portfolio.

CRE Asset Quality Trends 

The CRE portfolio asset quality trends as of September 30, 2020 have been negatively impacted by economic uncertainty attributable to the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as acquired nonperforming loans during third 

quarter 2020, with nonperforming loans up $49.2 million from December 31, 2019. The CRE portfolio could also continue to be negatively impacted in future periods due to COVID-19. The allowance increased to $208.0 million as of September 30, 2020, from $36.1 million as of December 31, 2019 primarily due to the initial allowance recorded on PCD loans in the third quarter 2020 and the impact of COVID-19. Allowance as a percentage of loans increased 83 basis points from 0.83% as of December 31, 2019, to 1.66% as of September 30, 2020. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total CRE loans increased to 0.41% as of September 30, 2020 from 0.04% at December 31, 2019. 

Accruing delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loans increased to 12 basis points as of September 30, 2020, from 2 basis points as of December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs were $1.3 million in third quarter 2020 compared to $0.2 million in third quarter 2019.

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate portfolio was $12.3 billion on September 30, 2020, and is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans including restricted balances (loans consolidated under ASC 810). The largest geographical concentr ations of balances as of September 30, 2020, are in Florida (31%), Tennessee (26%), Louisiana (10%), North Carolina (9%), Georgia (3%), and Alabama (3%), with no other state representing more than 3% of the portfolio. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 84% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 750 and refreshed FICO scores averaged 749 on September 30, 2020. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) comprise $2.5 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of September 30, 2020. FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is automatically frozen if a borrower becomes 45 days or more past due on payments. Once the draw period has concluded, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest 

payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of September 30, 2020, approxima tely 86% of FHN's HELOCs are in the draw period compared to approximately 76% as of December 31, 2019. Based on when draw periods are scheduled to end per the line agreement, it is expected that $472.8 million, or 21% of HELOCs currently in the draw period, will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months. Delinquencies and charge-off rates for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement; however, after some seasoning, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. The home equity lines of the consumer real estate portfolio are being monitored closely for those nearing the end of the draw period and borrowers are initially being contacted at least 24 months before the repayment period begins to remind the customer of the terms of their agreement and to inform them of options. 

September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 include $40.0 million and $18.8 million, respectively, of held-to-maturity consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure. 

The following table shows the HELOCs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period.

C onsumer Real Estate Asset Quality Trends 

Overall, performance of the consumer real estate portfolio remained stable in third quarter 2020. Economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic could impact future trends. The non-strategic segment is a run-off portfolio and while the absolute dollars of delinquencies, nonaccruals, and 30+ accruing delinquencies increased from year-end, due primarily to acquired loans, the 30+ 

delinquencies ratio improved while the nonperforming loans ratio remained relatively stable. That trend of increasing deterioration of ratios in the non-strategic segment is likely to continue and may become more skewed as the portfolio shrinks and stronger borrowers are better able than weaker ones to payoff or refinance elsewhere. NPLs as a percentage of loans increased 7 basis points from year-end to 1.46% as of September 30, 2020. The ALLL increased $237.0 million from December 31, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 112 

2019, to $265.4 million as of September 30, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial allowance recorded on PCD loans, and the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The allowance as a percentage of loans increased 169 basis points to 2.15% as of September 30, 2020 compared to year-end 2019. Driven by acquired loans, the balance of no nperf orming loans increased $94.4 million to $180.1 million a s of 

September 30, 2020. Loans delinquent 30 or more days and still accruing increased from $42.9 million as of December 31, 2019, to $48.4 milli on as of September 30, 2020. The portfolio realized net recoveries o f $3.5 mi llion in third quarter 2020 compared to net recoveries of $3.3 million in fourth quarter 2019 and net recoveries of $3.6 million in third quarter 2019.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to recognize current expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio. The total allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $988.1 million on September 30, 2020, from $200.3 million on December 31, 2019. The ALLL as of September 30, 2020 reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an initial allowance on PCD loans of $286.8 million. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases increased 101 basis points to 1.65% on September 30, 2020, compared to 0.64% on December 31, 2019. 

The provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to or release of earnings necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of current expected losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio. Provision expense was $230.0 million in third quarter 2020, compared to $15.0 million provision expense in third quarter 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to a $147.0 million provision for non-PCD assets acquired in the IBKC merger and Truist Bank branch acquisition, as well as from the declining economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

FHN expects asset quality trends to be impacted by the economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The C&#38;I portfolio reflects a broad mix of categories with the heaviest concentration in loans to mortgage companies which carry minimal credit risk. The C&#38;I portfolio as of September 30, 2020 includes $4.2 billion of loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP Loans") of the Small Business Administration ("SBA"). PPP loans are fully government guaranteed with the SBA. Due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions, PPP loans are considered to have no credit risk. The CRE portfolio metrics could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel and occupancy restrictions set by state and local governments affecting CRE- Hospitality and CRE-Retail. The consumer portfolio could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if consumer unemployment continues to rise and customers are unable to continue making loan payments. The consumer portfolio, however, is high quality with no subprime and minimal exposure to other traditional categories of high risk lending. The remaining non-strategic consumer real estate should continue to steadily wind down; however, it could be impacted if unemployment continues to rise and borrowers have difficulty making loan payments. Asset quality metrics within non-strategic have become skewed as the portfolio continues to shrink. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs in third quarter 2020 we re $66.6 million compared to $14.6 million of net charge-offs in third quarter 2019. 

Net charge -offs in third quarter 2020 in the commercial portfolio were $67.5 million compared to $15.5 million in net charge-offs in third quarter 20 19. Net charge-offs were impacted by higher energy charge-offs in the current quarter. Net recoveries in the consumer r eal estate portfolio were $3.5 m illion in third quarter 2020 compared to $3.6 million in net recoveries in third quarter 2019. Net charge-offs in the credit card and other consumer portfolio were $2.5 million in third quarter 2020 compared to $2.6 million a year ag o. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis), if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans in which FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. These, along with OREO, excluding OREO from government insured mortgages, represent nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;). 

Driven by acquired NPLs, total nonperforming assets (including NPLs HFS) increased to $470.8 million on September 30, 2020, from $181.9 million on December 31, 2019. The nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loa ns plus OREO and other assets) increased to 0.78% as of September 30, 2020, from 0.57% as of December 31, 2019. Portfolio nonperforming loans increased to $446.8 mi llion as of September 30, 2020 from $162.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven by the consumer real estate and CRE portfolios from acquired loans. 

The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs in the loan portfolio was 2.21 times as of September 30, 2020, compared to 1.24 times as of December 31, 2019. Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because loss content has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically reserves are not recorded.

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans co ntractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. Loans in the portfolio that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $14.6 million on September 30, 2020, compared to $21.9 million on December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by consumer real estate loans. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $74.0 million on September 30, 2020, compared to $36.1 million on December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by acquired loans, most notably in the CRE and C&#38;I portfolios. 

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal 

banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan po rtfolio were $698.5 million on September 30, 2020, $346.9 million on December 31, 2019, and $305.0 million on September 30, 2019. The increase in potential problem assets compared to December 31, 2019 was due to acquired loans in third quarter 2020 and a net increase in classified commercial loans within the C&#38;I portfolio. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 118 

separately. In a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a Troubled Debt Restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). See Note 4 &#8211; Loans and Leases for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

On September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, FHN had $321.4 million and $206.3 million portfolio loans classified 

as TDRs, respectively. For TDRs in the loan portfolio, FHN had loan loss reserves of $12.6 million and $19.7 million, or 4% and 10% of TDR balances, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally, FHN had $44.1 million and $51.1 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The following table provides a summary of TDRs for the periods ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99% confidence level and 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR (&#8220;SVaR&#8221;) measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is as follows: 

Table 20&#8212;VaR and SVaR Measures

2020 VaR and SVaR increased due to extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 120 

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks were as follows: 

Table 21&#8212;Schedule of Risks Included in VaR 

&#160; As of September 30, 2020 As of September 30, 2019 As of December 31, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ 3,621 &#160; $ 5,039 &#160; $ 1,379 $ 7,182 $ 693 $ 3,929 Credit spread risk 2,689 &#160; 9,688 &#160; 661 1,407 417 828 

2020 VaR and SVaR increased due to extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN&#8217;s Fixed Income division procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to customers, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, Fixed Income traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHN&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for Fixed Income to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its VaR measurements. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the "Capital" section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield 

curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within Fixed Income have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an internal assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's interest rate risk management practices as described under "Interest Rate Risk Management" beginning on page 90 of Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this MD&#38;A. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 121 

percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2020, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of 1.9%, 3.6% , 6.8%, and 10.7% , respectively compared to base NII. A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance o f 1.4% . A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 1.5% . Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 2.3% and 2.7%, assuming the absence of negative rates. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

FHN&#8217;s net interest income has been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the unemployment rate, customer loan deferral requests, the impact of government assistance programs, and other developments have influenced net interest income results. FHN is monitoring current economic trends and potential exposures closely.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Among other things, ALCO focuses on liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy. The objective of the Liquidity Policy is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry as a whole, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal F unds markets, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHLB ($14.3 billion was available at September 30, 2020), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's customer base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures these deposits to the extent authorized by law. Generally, these limits are $250 thousand per account owner for interest bearing and noninterest bearing 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 122 

accounts. The ratio of total loans, excludi ng loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits was 98% for September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

FHN also may use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Currently, the largest concentration of unsecured borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent bank customers. These funds are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings is securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with Regional Banking&#8217;s business customers or Fixed Income&#8217;s broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank may access the debt markets in order to provide funding through the issuance of senior or subordinated unsecured debt subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In May 2020, FHN issued $800 million of senior capital notes. In April 2020, First Horizon Bank issued $450 million of subordinated notes. These subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for First Horizon Bank as well as FHN, up to certain regulatory limits for minority interest capital instruments. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing preferred equity, and (for FHN) by issuing common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In January 2013, FHN issued $100 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and in May 2020, FHN issued $150 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. On July 2, 2020, as a result of the IBKC merger, FHN issued $237.5 million of three new series of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series B, Series C, and Series D). 

As of September 30, 2020, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295.4 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. The amount paid to the parent company through First Horizon Bank common dividends is managed as part of FHN&#8217;s overall cash management process, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, common dividends, loans, or advances. At any given time, the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow First Horizon Bank to declare preferred or common 

dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date. For any period, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s &#8216;retained net income&#8217; generally is equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by First Horizon Bank. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $806.4 million as of October 1, 2020. Additionally, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above well-capitalized levels (equal to an extra 2.50% above minimum levels) must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amounts of $65 million and $115 million in first and third quarter 2020 and $345.0 million in 2019. First Horizon Bank declared and paid preferred dividends in first, second, and third quarter 2020 and each quarter of 2019. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in fourth quarter 2020, payable in January 2021. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and also availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. FHN is subject to the capital conservation buffer requirements as described in the above paragraph for First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on October 1, 2020. FHN paid cash dividends of $331.25 per Series B preferred share and $165.00 per Series C preferred share on August 3, 2020, $1,550.00 per Series A preferred share and $2,383.33 per Series E preferred share on October 13, 2020 and $165.00 per Series C preferred share and $305.00 per Series D preferred share on November 2, 2020. In addition, in October 2020 the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts:. 

Dividend/Share Record Date Payment Date Common Stock $ 0.15 12/11/2020 01/04/2021 Preferred Stock Series A $ 1,550.00 12/24/2020 01/11/2021 Series B $ 331.25 01/15/2021 02/01/2021 Series C $ 165.00 01/15/2021 02/01/2021 Series E $ 1,625.00 12/24/2020 01/11/2021

Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations 

Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses 

Prior to September 2008 FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mortgage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. Sales typically were effected either as non-recourse whole loan sales or through non-recourse proprietary securitizations. Conventional conforming single-family residential mortgage loans were sold predominately to two government-sponsored entities, or "GSEs": Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Also, federally insured or guaranteed whole loans were pooled, and payments to investors were guaranteed through Ginnie Mae. Many mortgage loan originations, especially nonconforming mortgage loans, were sold to investors, or certificate-holders, predominantly through First Horizon proprietary securitizations but also, to a lesser extent, through other whole loans sold to private non-Agency purchasers. FHN used only one trustee for all of its First Horizon proprietary securitizations. In addition to First Horizon proprietary securitization and other whole loan sales activities, FHN also originated and sometimes sold or securitized second-lien, line of credit, and government-insured mortgage loans. 

From these pre-2009 activities, FHN has incurred substantial losses stemming from obligations to repurchase loans, pay make-whole amounts, or otherwise resolve claims that loans which FHN originated, or FHN's servicing of those loans, were deficient in a manner for which FHN was liable. Many years ago, FHN established a repurchase and foreclosure liability, or reserve, in connection with those claims. FHN has settled many claims, and the reserve is reduced each time a claim is settled. As discussed in Note 11 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

Servicing Obligations 

FHN's national servicing business was sold as part of the platform sale in 2008. A significant amount of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") was sold at that time, and a significant amount was retained. The related servicing activities, including foreclosure and loss mitigation practices, not sold in 2008 were outsourced including a subservicing arrangement initiated in 2011 (the "2011 subservicer"). In fourth quarter 2013 and first quarter 2014, FHN sold and transferred a substantial majority of its remaining servicing obligations and servicing assets (including advances) to the 2011 subservicer. The 

servicing still retained by FHN is not significant and continues to be subserviced. 

As servicer, FHN had contractual obligations to the owners of the loans (primarily GSEs) and securitization trustees to handle billing, custodial, and other tasks related to each loan. Each subservicer undertook to perform those obligations on FHN's behalf during the applicable subservicing period, although FHN legally remained the servicer of record for those loans that were subserviced. 

As mentioned in Note 11 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures - FHN has received a notice of indemnification claims from its 2011 subservicer, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, currently doing business as "Mr. Cooper." The notice asserts several categories of indemnity obligations by FHN to Nationstar in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction. This matter currently is not in formal litigation, but litigation in the future is possible. 

Repurchase Accrual Methodology 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

The repurchase and foreclosure liability is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 124 

as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve 

levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability increased to $15.9 mi llion on September 30, 2020 from $14.5 million on December 31, 2019. 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, availability and the administration of stimulus relief for the economy. Additional impacts include how the pandemic affects FHN&#8217;s customers, as well as political uncertainty, potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our customers, and FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives. 

FHN's performance, and the entire U.S. financial services industry, is affected considerably by the overall health of the U.S. and global economy and outlook. Furthermore, FHN may be directly or indirectly impacted by global events that impact clients and their businesses. The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, and has adversely affected FHN&#8217;s and its clients' ability to conduct normal business, and could harm FHN&#8217;s business and future results of operations. 

In March 2020 the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates twice and started a &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit. The effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation which, among other things, is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate the severity of an economic recession. These changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market are likely to negatively impact FHN&#8217;s net interest margin. In the near term, amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), may offset a portion of the net interest margin decline. 

The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly altered business in the U.S. and globally leading to partial or full business closures, individuals being furloughed or laid off, significant increases in unemployment, and workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home. Disruption to FHN&#8217;s customers due to governmental and societal responses to COVID-19 are likely to adversely affect FHN&#8217;s loan and deposit fee income and could create downward loan migration and a corresponding increase in loan loss expense and reserves. In addition, loan charge-offs likely will increase over time, especially if economic disruption 

related to the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time. Furthermore, government programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) and other guidance intended to provide relief to customers through temporary modifications and deferrals, may in some instances mask or postpone reporting of credit problems and potential defaults. In these circumstances, current credit quality indicators may not be reflective of the underlying health of FHN's portfolios. 

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the businesses of FHN for the remainder of 2020 or afterward. 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, LIBOR as currently operated may not continue after 2021. FHN is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from LIBOR will have on FHN; however, because FHN has instruments with floating rate terms based on LIBOR, FHN may experience increases in interest, dividends, and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to 2021. Additionally, the transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. FHN has initiated efforts to 1) develop an inventory of affected loans, securities, and derivatives, 2) evaluate and draft modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of LIBOR retirement, 3) obtain an understanding of the potential effects for applicable securities and derivatives and 4) assess revisions to product pricing structures based on alternative reference rates. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. Refer to the Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective section of Note 1 - Financial Information for additional information. Additionally, the IRS has released a proposal that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts. This proposal contains specific guidance that must be met in 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 125 

order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

FHN has prioritized expense discipline to include reducing or controlling certain expenses including realization of merger efficiencies, enabling the investment into revenue-producing activities, customer-facing technology, and critical infrastructure. FHN remains committed to organic growth through customer retention, key hires, targeted incentives, and other traditional means. 

Lastly, while FHN has resolved most matters from the pre-2009 mortgage business, some remain unresolved. The timing or financial impact of resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with accuracy. Accordingly, the non-strategic segment may occasionally and unexpectedly impact FHN&#8217;s overall quarterly results negatively or positively with reserve accruals or releases. Also, although new pre-2009 mortgage business matters of significance arise at a much slower pace than in years past and some formerly common legal claims no longer can be made due to the passage of time, potential for new pre-2009 mortgage business matters remains. 

Foreclosure Practices 

FHN retains exposure for potential deficiencies in servicing related to its pre-2009 mortgage servicing business and subservicing arrangements. Further details regarding these matters are provided in 

"Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses - Servicing Obligations" under "Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations." 

FHN response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

As previously mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and will continue, to directly and indirectly impact FHN and our customers. FHN has adapted many operations to help ensure the health and safety of e mployees and customers during these uncertain times. Among other things, FHN has implemented remote work policies, encouraged contactless banking or in-person branch activities to be handled by appointment, as wel l as additional sick time and child care assistance for employees. 

Loans 

FHN is act ively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on customers and FHN&#8217;s credit quality. FHN continues to reach out to customers to discuss challenges and solutions, provide line draws and new extensions to existing customers, provide support for small businesses through the PPP (discussed in more detail below) and other stimulus programs, as well as provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. Additionally, in certain sectors, FHN has reduced or stopped new lending. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

In 2020 Congress created the foundation for a paycheck protection program ("PPP"). Under the PPP, qualifying businesses may receive loans from private lenders, such as FHN, that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. These loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels; to the extent forgiven, the borrower is relieved from payment, while the lender still is paid from the program. Congress has revised the PPP this year, and may make further revisions to PPP in the future. 

Lenders making PPP loans are paid a fee by the Small Business Administration. Gross lender fees range from 1% to 5% of the loan amount. A borrower can use an agent to assist in the preparation of their PPP applications, with the costs of the agent potentially being paid from the gross lender fee. Additionally, originating banks have certain internal costs of originating PPP loans. 

FHN originated/acquired through merger 32,727 of PPP loans with an aggregate principal of $4.2 billion through September 30, 2020. For these loans, FHN anticipates recognizing net lender fees of approximately $60 million. FHN has decided to hold its PPP loans for investment. Therefore, the amount of SBA fees net of total direct origination costs are deferred as a discount to the recorded carrying value of the PPP loans. This discount is being amortized prospectively to interest income. SBA loan forgiveness payments are considered prepayments of the related loans. Under existing accounting principles, amortization of net origination fees can reflect expected prepayment activity if prepayments are determined to be probable and both the timing and volume can be reasonably estimated. Based on the current terms of the PPP loans, including the expected end of the payment deferral period, FHN estimates that substantially all of the prepayment-eligible portions of PPP loans will be prepaid by the end of 2021 as these loans are forgiven. These estimated prepayments result in a similar amount of the net fees being recognized in interest income. 

Since PPP loans carry a full SBA guarantee, they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. FHN has assigned a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

Lending Assistance for Borrowers 

Other customer support initiatives include incremental lending assistance for borrowers through delayed payment programs and fee waivers. The following table provides the UPB of loans related to deferrals granted to FHN&#8217;s customers that have been processed through September 30, 2020. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 126 

(Dollars in thousands) As of September 30, 2020 Commercial: Commercial and industrial $ 352,124 &#160; Commercial real estate 556,063 &#160; Total Commercial $ 908,187 &#160; Consumer: HELOC $ 21,750 &#160; R/E installment loans 404,983 &#160; Credit Card and Other 2,980 &#160; Total Consumer 429,713 &#160; Total $ 1,337,900 &#160; 

Commercial deferrals processed in our different lines of business were comprised primarily of general commercial (75% or $684.5 million), private client (10% or $90.0 million), specialty (7% or $66.0 million - primarily franchise finance), and professional commercial real estate (5% or $46.5 million). 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Except for the changes to the following Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Business Combinations sections, there have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s critical accounting policies as described in &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; beginning on page 99 of Item 7 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the ALLL is a &#8220;critical accounting estimate&#8221; as: (1) changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan and lease losses and net income, (2) it requires management to predict borrowers&#8217; likelihood or capacity to repay, including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions, (3) prepayment activity must be projected to estimate the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms, (4) it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and (5) expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated. Accordingly, this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to end of a loan&#8217;s estimated life. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and recoveries and is decreased by charged-off loans. Principal loan amounts are charged off against the ALLL in the period in which the loan or any portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible. This critical accounting estimate applies to the regional banking, non-strategic, and corporate segments. A management committee comprised of representatives from Risk Management, Finance, Credit, 

and Treasury performs a quarterly review of the assumptions used in FHN&#8217;s ALLL analytical models, makes qualitative assessments of the loan and lease portfolio, and determines if qualitative adjustments should be recommended to the modeled results. On a quarterly basis, as a part of Enterprise Risk reporting and discussion, management addresses credit reserve adequacy and credit losses with the Executive and Risk Committee of FHN&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

FHN believes that the critical assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include: (1) the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers; (2) borrower specific information made available to FHN is current and accurate; (3) the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly; (4) the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly, including consideration of expected prepayments; (5) the economic forecasts utilized in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions; (6) entity-specific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the initial basis for estimating expected credit losses; (7) the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined; (8) the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable; (9) expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated; and (10) qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements. 

While management uses the best information available to establish the ALLL, future adjustments to the ALLL and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 3Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 127 

these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. 

See Note 1 - Financial Information and Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for detail regarding FHN&#8217;s processes, models, and methodology for determining the ALLL. 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

Pursuant to applicable accounting guidance FHN generally recognizes assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed in acquisitions at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with the merger-related transaction costs expensed in the period incurred. Specified items such as net investment in leases as lessor, acquired operating lease assets and liabilities as lessee, employee benefit plans and income-tax related balances are recognized in accordance with accounting guidance that results in measurements other than fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed follows the fair value hierarchy described in Note 17 &#8211; Fair Value of Assets &#38; Liabilities. This often involves estimates based on internal or third-party valuations which include appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, discount rates, credit risk, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. The credit allowance for 

PCD assets is recognized within business combination accounting. The credit allowance for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision expense in the same reporting period as the business combination. 

Premiums and discounts on acquired AFS debt securities and loans and leases held for investment are amortized to interest income over their estimated remaining lives, which may include prepayment estimates in certain circumstances. Premiums and discounts on acquired debt are amortized to interest expense over their remaining lives. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which identified finite-life intangible assets will be amortized is subjective. Intangible assets are generally amortized using an accelerated methodology that reflects the cash flow projections utilized in the applicable valuation.
