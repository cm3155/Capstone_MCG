First Horizon National Corporation (&#8220;FHN,&#8221; &#8220;First Horizon,&#8221; the &#8220;Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a Tennessee corporation. We are headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and are a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. At December 31, 2019, we had total consolidated assets of $43.3 billion. 

We provide diversified financial services primarily through our principal subsidiary, First Horizon Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Bank is a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The Bank and its subsidiaries conduct the Bank&#8217;s traditional and specialty banking businesses principally under the FIRST HORIZON BANK brand, its wealth management business principally under the First Horizon Advisors brand, and its fixed income business principally under the FHN FINANCIAL Financial brand. 

The Bank was founded in 1864 as First National Bank of Memphis. FHN was incorporated in 1968 to be the Bank&#8217;s holding company. 

&#160;

During 2019 approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues were provided by fee and other noninterest income, and approximately 65% of revenues were provided by net interest income. 

As a financial holding company, we coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain systems of financial, operational, and administrative control intended to coordinate selected policies and activities, including as described in Item 9A of Part II of this report. 

Business Segments 

Our financial results of operations are reported through operational business segments which are not closely related to the legal structure of our subsidiaries. We operate through four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. We sometimes refer to regional banking, fixed income, and corporate as our &#8220;core&#8221; business segments. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 3 

Financial and other additional information concerning our segments-including information concerning assets, revenues, and financial results-appears in our 2019 MD&#38;A (Item 7) and in Note 20-Business Segment Information, of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8). 

The Bank 

During 2019, through its various business lines, including consolidated subsidiaries, the Bank generated gross revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) of approximately $2.3 billion and generated a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had $43.1 billion in total assets, $32.8 billion in total deposits, and $30.9 billion in total loans (net of unearned income). Among Tennessee headquartered banks, the Bank ranked 1 st in Tennessee deposit market share at June 30, 2019 based on FDIC data. 

Physical Business Locations 

At December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s subsidiaries had over 300 business locations in 20 U.S. states, excluding off-premises ATMs. Almost all of those locations were banking centers and FHN Financial offices. 

At year-end, the Bank had 272 banking centers in seven states:

Loans &#38; Deposits 

Our largest asset would be our loan portfolio-if all of our loans were viewed collectively-and lending is a critical, core business for us. Similarly, our largest resource is our deposit base, and deposit-taking also is a critical, core business. At year-end 2019, we had total net loans of $30.9 billion and total deposits of $32.4 billion. Most of our loans and deposits are held in our regional banking segment. The tables below provide an overview of our loan and deposit balances at December 31, 2019 or averaged over the year 2019. 

Geographically, nearly half of our loans originate from Tennessee and North Carolina, with no other state accounting for 10%. Three-fourths of our deposits are associated with Tennessee, and 90% are from Tennessee and North Carolina.

*Averages for 2019. 

These tables show that our lending outside of Tennessee is funded in significant part by deposits from our Tennessee markets, and a significant portion of funding for our commercial lending comes from consumer deposits. Keeping our funding uses and sources in balance is a critical function for us. Excess deposits most typically are invested in investments permitted by our regulators, while excess lending most typically is funded with borrowing. Because loans and deposits fluctuate constantly, we maintain access to significant non-deposit liquidity sources, primarily short-term borrowing. 

Most of our commercial loans are traditional, unsecured &#8220;commercial, financial, and industrial,&#8221; or &#8220;C&#38;I,&#8221; loans, and most of the rest are secured &#8220;commercial real estate,&#8221; or &#8220;CRE,&#8221; loans. Within C&#38;I, nearly 36% of loans are to businesses in the financial services industry, including mortgage lending companies, and the rest are in a wide range of industries.

&#160;

The C&#38;I portfolio was $20.1 billion on December 31, 2019, and is comprised of loans used for general business purposes. Typical products include working capital lines of credit, term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. The largest geographical concentrations of C&#38;I balances as of December 31, 2019, are in Tennessee (31%), North Carolina (10%), California (9%), Texas (6%), Florida (6%),Georgia (4%), and South Carolina (3%), with no other state representing more than 3% of the C&#38;I portfolio. 

Further information regarding our loans is provided in Note 4-Loans within our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8), and under the captions &#8220;Statement of Condition Review-2019 Compared to 2018&#8221; beginning on page 59, and &#8220;Asset Quality-Trend Analysis of 2019 compared to 2018&#8221; beginning on page 65, of our 2019 MD&#38;A (Item 7), which disclosures are incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. 

##TABLE_START Significant Business Developments Over Past Five Years 

##TABLE_END

Over the past five years, key strategic priorities for us have included: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

targeted expansion of consumer and commercial banking products and markets 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

opportunistic expansion of commercial lending, mainly through acquisition transactions, talent development, and talent acquisitions 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

vigorous discipline in controlling expenses not closely related to revenue production 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

managing our business units and products with a strong emphasis on risk-adjusted returns on invested capital 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

robust emphasis on providing exceptional customer experience as a primary means to differentiate us from competitors 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

investment in scalable technology and other infrastructure to attract and retain business, and to support expansion. 

##TABLE_END 

Examples of our implementation of these priorities include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

In 2017 we acquired Capital Bank, which had $10 billion of total assets and nearly 200 banking centers in four southeastern U.S. states. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Other acquisitions during this period include TrustAtlantic Bank (2015) and a restaurant franchise finance business and portfolio (2016). 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We have made key talent hires in critical areas throughout our company, with the main focus on organically growing economically profitable business lines inside and outside our traditional markets. 

##TABLE_END

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 5 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We have pruned our physical network to reflect long-term trends in customer usage of physical banking centers, and correspondingly are making more efficient use of other physical facilities. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Organic and acquisitive loan growth in regional banking has more than offset loan attrition from the non-strategic segment, where legacy loan portfolios are in long-term wind-down. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Organic commercial loan growth has been strong in specialty lending areas, such as lending to mortgage companies, where margins tend to be better but outstanding balances tend to fluctuate seasonally and cyclically.

&#160; 

Key Factors 

Several factors complicate comparisons among the past five years. Key among those are: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital Bank. Many year-end financial figures increased substantially in 2017 due to the Capital Bank transaction. Full-year operating results were less noticeably impacted until 2018, because the Capital transaction closed late in 2017. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Tax Reform. Corporate tax reform in December, 2017 resulted in significant negative adjustments to net deferred tax asset balance, driving a large net loss in fourth quarter that year. Financial results in 2018 and 2019, in contrast, benefited significantly from lower tax rates compared to earlier years. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Interest Rate Policy . Although interest rates during each of these years were quite low by historical standards, they were raised modestly starting in 2015, more vigorously in 2018, and then reduced three times in 2019. These changes impacted our net interest margin up and down. Net interest margin is a measure of the profit we make on loans and other earning assets in relation to our cost of deposits and other funding sources. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Sale of Visa Class B Stock. In 2018 we sold our remaining legacy stock holdings of Visa, recognizing a 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

pretax gain that significantly increased noninterest income that year. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Very low loan loss rates. During these five years, our provision for loan losses was unusually low. When provision is low, differences from year to year can be idiosyncratic, driven by one or just a few customers. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fixed Income Volatility. For several of these years, market conditions were quite subdued for our fixed income segment. In 2019, however, increased market volatility and the downward direction of interest rates resulted in much higher trading volume and noninterest income in that segment. 

##TABLE_END Trends 

Noteworthy trends during this period include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Net loan growth has driven asset growth. Overall growth has been strong despite run-off of non-strategic loans. The large increase in 2017 was driven by the Capital Bank merger, and 2018 was impacted by the Capital Bank systems integration effort. Growth in 2016 (vs. 2015) and in 2019 (vs. 2018) was organic. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Growth in net interest income was significant through 2018, driven by net loan growth, interest rate increases, and (in 2018) the Capital Bank merger. Growth flattened in 2019 as net loan growth was offset by interest rate declines. 

##TABLE_END

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 6 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Through 2018, an overall down-trend in noninterest income was due mainly to lower fixed income revenues, driven by challenging market conditions. The large increase in 2018 was mainly due to the Visa stock sale. That trend reversed in 2019 as interest rates declined, market volatility increased, and fixed income revenues improved. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Deposits grew significantly through 2018. Much of that growth was organic, helped by a rising rate environment. The large uptick in 2017 was driven substantially by the Capital Bank transaction. Total deposit growth moderated in 2019, as solid regional banking deposit growth offset deliberate reductions in (more expensive) market-indexed deposits. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Exited Businesses 

Since the 2008-09 recession, we have focused on traditional banking and fixed income products and services. We exited our legacy nation-wide mortgage banking business in 2008, though we continue to manage related legal exposures and the wind-down of a still-sizable loan portfolio. We partially or fully exited other businesses since 2008. Exited businesses are managed in our non-strategic segment. 

##TABLE_START Significant Business Developments Expected in 2020 

##TABLE_END

We signed agreements late in 2019 for two transactions that we expect to close in 2020. The larger of them will significantly transform our company in terms of size, geographic reach, and the scope of financial services we offer. 

30-Branch Acquisition 

In the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced an agreement to purchase 30 branches in North Carolina (20), Virginia (8), and Georgia (2) from SunTrust Bank (now Truist Bank). Those branches are in markets we do not serve currently, or in which we do not have a leading market position. Along with the branch facilities, we will acquire related loans and assume deposits. At the time of announcement, we estimated the loans to be $0.4 billion and the deposits to be $2.4 billion. The 30-branch acquisition is scheduled to close in the second quarter of 2020. 

IBKC Merger of Equals 

In the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced a merger-of-equals agreement with IBERIABANK Corporation (&#8220;IBKC&#8221;). IBKC is the parent company of IBERIABANK based in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the time of announcement, IBKC, with $32 billion of total assets, had over 190 banking centers in 11 states: Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, and New York. IBKC&#8217;s largest concentrations of banking centers are in Louisiana 

&#160;

and Florida. IBKC offers many of the same financial services that we offer, but exceeds us in several areas, most notably in equipment financing and title insurance. 

The combined company, on a September 30, 2019 pro-forma basis which includes the 30-branch acquisition, would have had $78 billion in assets, $59 billion in deposits, and $55 billion in loans. After closing, our board will expand to 17 directors, of which nine will be from legacy FHN and eight will be from legacy IBKC. IBKC shareholders will receive 4.584 shares of our common stock for each IBKC common share held, and collectively will be issued 44% of our post-closing outstanding common shares. In order to accommodate a stock issuance of that size, we must amend our corporate charter to increase the number of common shares we are authorized to issue. 

The IBKC transaction is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies, regulatory approvals, and other customary contractual conditions. We expect to hold a special meeting of our shareholders to vote on the IBKC transaction, including related amendments to our corporate charter, in the second quarter of 2020, and we expect the IBKC merger to close in mid-2020. 

##TABLE_START Other General Information 

##TABLE_END

Strategic Transactions 

An element of our business strategy is to consider acquisitions and divestitures that would enhance long-term shareholder value. Significant acquisitions and divestitures which closed during the past three years are described in 

&#160;

Note 2-Acquisitions and Divestitures, of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8), which information is incorporated into this Item 1 by this reference. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 7 

As mentioned above, in November 2017 we legally closed our acquisition of Capital Bank. In May 2018 we completed systems integration for that transaction. 

Also as mentioned above, in November 2019 we agreed to acquire 30 branches in three southeastern states, and we entered into a merger-of-equals agreement with IBKC. Both are expected to close in 2020. The IBKC merger will significantly transform our company in terms of size, geographic reach, and the scope of financial services we offer. 

Subsidiaries 

FHN&#8217;s consolidated operating subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 are listed in Exhibit 21. 

The Bank is a government securities dealer. The FHN Financial division of the Bank is registered with the SEC as a municipal securities dealer and the FHN Financial Municipal Advisors division of the Bank is registered with the SEC as a municipal adviser. The Bank is supervised and regulated as described in &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in this Item below. 

Martin and Company, Inc., First Horizon Advisors, Inc., and FHN Financial Main Street Advisors, LLC are registered with the SEC as investment advisers. First Horizon Advisors, Inc. and FHN Financial Securities Corp. are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and all states where they conduct business for which registration is required. First Horizon Insurance Services, Inc., FHIS, Inc., and First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. are licensed as insurance agencies in all states where they do business for which licensing is required. FHN Financial Securities Corp., First Horizon Advisors, Inc., First Horizon Insurance Services, Inc., FHIS, Inc., and First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. are financial subsidiaries under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. First Horizon Advisors, Inc. is licensed as an insurance agency in the states where it does business for which licensing is required for the sale of annuity products. First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. is inactive. 

Customer Concentration 

Neither we nor any of our significant subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

We do not experience material seasonality. We do experience seasonal variation in certain revenues, expenses, and credit trends. Historically, these variations have somewhat increased certain expenses for the regional banking and fixed income segments, and somewhat diminished certain revenues for the regional banking segment, principally in the first quarter each year. In addition, we experience seasonal variation in certain asset and liability balances, principally in the fourth (commercial lending related to consumer mortgages, certain trading balances, and certain employee-related reserves) and first (mortgage-related lending) quarters. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2019, FHN and its subsidiaries had 5,017 employees, or 4,994 full-time-equivalent employees, not including contract labor for certain services.

Scope of this Section 

This section describes certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities. It also provides certain specific information about us. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by 

&#160;

express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business. 

Overview 

FHN 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 8 

FHN is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and is registered with the Federal Reserve. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. 

A bank holding company that is not a financial holding company is limited to engaging in &#8220;banking&#8221; and activities found by the Federal Reserve to be &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; Eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature.&#8221; &#8220;Financial&#8221; activities are broader in scope than those which are &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; See &#8220;Financial Activities other than Banking&#8221; beginning on page 14 below. 

The Federal Reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirer&#8217;s principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, although state law may still impose certain requirements. See &#8220;Interstate Banking and Branching&#8221; beginning on page 13, and &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;)&#8221; beginning on page 13. 

The Tennessee Bank Structure Act of 1974, among other things, prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the home state is Tennessee (a &#8220;Tennessee bank&#8221;) if, upon consummation, the company would directly or indirectly control 30% or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in Tennessee. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that we held approximately 15.39% of such deposits. 

The Bank 

Our Bank is a Tennessee banking corporation subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the TDFI. In addition to general supervision and examination powers, the TDFI has the power to approve mergers with the Bank, the Bank&#8217;s issuance of preferred stock or capital notes, the establishment of banking centers, and many other corporate actions. 

The Bank has chosen to be a member of the Federal Reserve; as a result, the Federal Reserve is the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. As a member bank, the Bank must buy and hold stock in its district Federal Reserve Bank equal to 6% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. The Bank is paid a dividend on its investment at a rate which varies with ten-year U.S. Treasury rates, capped at 6%. The Bank cannot sell its investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and the investment provides the Bank with no control over the Federal Reserve System. 

&#160;

Tennessee law requires the Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve, to comply with federal capital and many other regulatory requirements in lieu of, or sometimes in addition to, state requirements. For that reason, this &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section focuses on federal requirements for many topics related to the Bank, mentioning state requirements only where significant. 

From 1864 until October 2019, the Bank was a national banking association subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. During October, 2019, the Bank converted from a national bank to a Tennessee state bank. Conversion did not significantly alter the scope of the Bank&#8217;s activities: Tennessee law generally allows a Tennessee state bank to take any action that a Tennessee-based national bank could take. 

The Bank is insured by, and subject to regulation by, the FDIC and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the CFPB. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition, several of the Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries are regulated separately, as discussed in &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221; beginning on page 8 of this report. 

In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services. 

The regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, not for the protection of our Bank or our security holders. 

Regulatory Tiers Based on Asset Size 

Many rules dealing with critical regulatory topics divide banks into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size. Different topics have different cut-off points for the tiers. Within each topic, different rules apply to the different tiers. 

Cut-off points vary significantly. However, as a rough generalization, for many regulatory topics the critical cut-off points are $10 billion, $100 billion, and $250 billion. Companies with less than $10 billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are, and companies with $250 billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are. As a result, under 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 9 

current law, compliance costs and restrictions grow with size, they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier, and we are in a middle tier in many respects. 

The remainder of this &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; discussion focuses on current rules which apply to FHN based on our current asset size. 

Large-Bank Supervision Risk Categories 

Federal regulators have established four risk-based categories for applying enhanced prudential standards (enhanced for larger banks). Category I applies to the global systemically important companies. Categories II, III, and IV apply (with certain exceptions) to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $700 billion, $250 billion, and $100 billion, respectively. Currently, we and the Bank are below Category IV&#8217;s floor and therefore, generally, we are not subject to enhanced prudential standards. We expect that, immediately after closing the IBKC merger and 30-branch acquisition mentioned in this Item 1 above, we will continue to be below Category IV&#8217;s floor. 

Payment of Dividends 

FHN is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries. FHN&#8217;s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on its stock or to pay principal (including premium, if any) and interest on debt securities, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to FHN, as well as by FHN to its shareholders. 

FHN 

Under Tennessee corporate law, FHN is not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, FHN would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our Board must consider our current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, including the needs of the Bank which FHN is obligated to support. 

The Bank 

Under Tennessee corporate law, the Bank (like FHN, discussed above) may not pay a dividend if the Bank would not be able to pay its debts when due or if the Bank&#8217;s assets would be inadequate, in a dissolution, to pay liabilities and preferential rights. Similarly, the Bank&#8217;s Board must consider current and prospective needs in making a decision to declare a dividend. 

In addition, in order to pay cash dividends, the Bank must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI Commissioner if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors in any calendar year 

&#160;

exceeds the total of (i) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for that year plus (ii) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years, less certain required capital transfers, as applicable. Below that ceiling, approval generally is not required (but see &#8220;Other Factors Affecting Dividends&#8221; immediately following this discussion). Applying the applicable rules, at January 1, 2020, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank's common or preferred stock totaling approximately $331.2 million without obtaining approval. The application of those restrictions to the Bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference: under the caption &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; in our 2019 MD&#38;A (Item 7) beginning on page 90 of this report; and under the caption &#8220;Restrictions on dividends&#8221; in Note 12-Regulatory Capital and Restrictions of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8), beginning on page 164 of this report. 

Other Factors Affecting Dividends 

If, in the opinion of the Federal Reserve, FHN or the Bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of FHN or the Bank, could include the payment of dividends), the Federal Reserve may require FHN or the Bank to cease and desist from that practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 

In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured depository institution (such as the Bank) may not make any capital distributions, pay any management fees to its holding company, or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. 

The payment of cash dividends by FHN or by the Bank also may be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed by debt covenants. For example, as discussed under &#8220;Capital Adequacy&#8221; starting on page 11, FHN's ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer. 

The Federal Reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising, among other things, that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company&#8217;s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company&#8217;s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs and overall 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 10 

current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

The Bank&#8217;s ability to lend or extend credit to FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries (including for purposes of this paragraph, in certain situations, subsidiaries of the Bank) is restricted. The Bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to FHN or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds 20% of its capital stock and surplus. Extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and FHN or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Further, the type, amount, and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated. 

There are similar legal restrictions on: the Bank&#8217;s purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; the Bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; the issuance of guaranties, acceptances, and letters of credit on behalf of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; and certain bank transactions with FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, or with respect to which FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries act as agent, participate, or have a financial interest. 

Capital Adequacy 

Federal financial industry regulators require that regulated institutions maintain minimum capital levels. The capital rules in the U.S. are based on international standards known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Those standards require the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio&#8221;) must be at least 4.5%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital consists of core components of Tier 1 Capital. The core components consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 9.20% and the Bank&#8217;s was 9.38%. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

6%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 8%. Tier 1 Capital consists of the Tier 1 core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above, plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.15% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.18%. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Total Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Total Capital ratios must be at least 10%. At December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s Total Capital Ratio was 11.22% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.77%. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital Conservation Buffer. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Leverage Ratio-Base. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN or the Bank, the Leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Leverage ratio must be at least 5%. The Leverage ratio is Tier 1 Capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. At December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s Leverage ratio was 9.04% and the Bank&#8217;s was 9.12%. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Leverage Ratio-Supplemental. For the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions, not including FHN or the Bank, a minimum supplementary Leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio. This requirement does not apply to institutions with assets of less than $100 billion, and so does not apply to FHN or the Bank. For larger institutions, the requirement applies based on which Category a bank is in. Categories IV, III, and II apply to banks with $100 billion, $250 billion, and $750 billion, respectively, subject to several exceptions based on certain holdings, activities, or exposures. Category I includes systemically important institutions. 

##TABLE_END FHN believes that both FHN and the Bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2019. 

Federal regulators have incorporated market and interest-rate risk components into its risk-based capital standards. Those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as important qualitative 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 11 

factors to consider in assessing an institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. 

Federal regulators&#8217; market risk rules are applicable to covered institutions-those with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least 10% of their total assets or at least $1 billion. FHN and the Bank are covered institutions under the rule. The rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and include, among other things, the addition of a component for stressed value at risk. The rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. Alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks, such as exposures to sovereign debt, public sector entities, other banking institutions, corporate debt, and securitizations. In addition, an 8% capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions, not including FHN or the Bank. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers a &#8220;Tangible Tier 1 Capital Leverage Ratio&#8221; (deducting all intangibles) and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

&#160;

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)&#8221; immediately below for additional information. 

In addition, the Bank is required to have a capital structure that the TDFI determines is adequate, based on TDFI&#8217;s assessment of the Bank&#8217;s businesses and risks. The TDFI may require the Bank to increase its capital, if found to be inadequate. 

Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 

Federal banking regulators must take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regarding FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories. The specific requirements applicable to us are summarized in the following table. 

REQUIREMENTS FOR PCA CAPITALIZATION CATEGORIES 

##TABLE_START Well capitalized 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.5% 

Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 8% 

Total Capital ratio of at least 10% 

Leverage ratio of at least 5% 

Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels 

Adequately capitalized 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4.5% 

Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6% 

Total Capital ratio of at least 8% 

Leverage ratio of at least 4% 

Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels 

Undercapitalized 

Failure to maintain any requirement to be adequately capitalized 

Significantly Undercapitalized 

Failure to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 3%, Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4%, Total Capital ratio of at least 6%, or a Leverage ratio of at least 3% 

Critically Undercapitalized 

Failure to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to at least 2% of total assets 

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above. An institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results. 

An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its 

&#160;

holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. An insured depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan, for the 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 12 

plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized. 

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. 

Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator, generally within 90 days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized. 

Holding Company Structure and Support of Subsidiary Banks 

Because FHN is a holding company, its right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank) except to the extent that FHN may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, depositors of a bank, and the FDIC as their subrogee, would be entitled to priority over the creditors in the event of liquidation of a bank subsidiary. 

Under Federal Reserve policy FHN is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, the Bank. This support may be required at times even though, absent such Federal Reserve policy, FHN might not wish to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Cross-Guarantee Liability 

A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#8220;in danger of default.&#8221; &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC&#8217;s claim for damages is superior to claims of 

&#160;

shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors, and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. 

Currently the Bank is the only depository institution owned by FHN. If FHN were to operate another depository institution, any loss suffered by the FDIC in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the cross-guarantee provisions, the assessment of such estimated losses against FHN&#8217;s other subsidiary bank(s), and a potential loss of FHN&#8217;s investment in its subsidiary banks. 

Interstate Branching and Mergers 

As mentioned above, the Bank generally must have TDFI&#8217;s approval to establish a new banking center (technically, a &#8220;branch&#8221;). For a new banking center located outside of Tennessee, Tennessee law requires the Bank to comply with branching laws applicable to the state where the new banking center will be located. Federal law allows the Bank to establish or acquire a branch in another state to the same extent as a bank chartered in that other state would be allowed to establish or acquire a branch in Tennessee. 

For an interstate merger or acquisition: the acquiring bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed; concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded; regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk; and the acquiring bank must have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; standing under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (discussed immediately below). 

Once a bank has established branches in a state through de novo or acquired branching or through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may then establish or acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a bank chartered in that state is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state. 

Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) 

The CRA requires each U.S. bank, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of each community where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income (&#8220;LMI&#8221;) communities. The Federal Reserve assesses the Bank periodically for CRA compliance, and that assessment is made public. The Bank&#8217;s LMI operations and activities generally are critical focal points in those assessments. The next CRA assessment is expected in 2020 or 2021. 

A CRA rating below &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; can slow or halt a bank&#8217;s plans to expand by branching, acquisition, or merger, and can prevent a bank holding company from becoming a financial holding company. The Bank received a rating of &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent CRA assessment, issued in 2017. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 13 

Late in 2019, certain federal regulatory agencies proposed changes to their regulations under the CRA. Although highly technical, the proposal prompted several federal legislators to submit letters in opposition. The Federal Reserve did not join the proposal, so technically the proposal does not apply to FHN or the Bank. However, this proposal could lead to some type of CRA regulatory reform that the Federal Reserve does join or, possibly, legislation amending the CRA. 

Financial Activities other than Banking 

Federal Law 

Federal law generally allows financial holding companies broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These include: insurance underwriting and brokerage; merchant banking; securities underwriting, dealing, and market-making; real estate development; and such additional activities as the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental. A bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the Federal Reserve, certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well-managed and well-capitalized. 

Federal law also permits banks to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries. To control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary, a bank must meet the following requirements: 

##TABLE_START (1) 

The bank must receive approval from its primary federal regulator for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

The bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be well-capitalized and well-managed. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) 

The aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of: 45% of the bank&#8217;s consolidated total assets; or $50 billion (subject to indexing for inflation). 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) 

The bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) 

If the bank is one of the one hundred largest banks, the bank must meet the long-term debt rating or alternative standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from time to time. If this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary, the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

No new activity may be commenced unless the bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above. 

In addition, federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the Bank&#8217;s operations, including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of customer information. 

At December 31, 2019, FHN is a financial holding company and the Bank has a number of financial subsidiaries, as discussed in &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221; beginning on page 8 of this report. 

Tennessee Law 

Tennessee law does not expressly restrict the activities of a bank holding company or its non-bank affiliates. However, no Tennessee bank may maintain a branch office on the premises of an affiliate if the affiliate is engaged in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company, a financial holding company, a national bank, or a national bank subsidiary under federal law. Tennessee law permits Tennessee banks to establish subsidiaries and to engage in any activities permissible for a national bank located in Tennessee, subject to compliance with Tennessee regulations relating to the conduct of such activities for the purpose of maintaining bank safety and soundness. 

Interchange Fee Restrictions 

Regulations severely cap interchange fees which the Bank may charge merchants for debit card transactions. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker rule (1) generally prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading, which is engaging as principal (for the bank&#8217;s own account) in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of financial instruments, and (2) limits banks&#8217; ability to invest in or sponsor hedge funds or private equity funds. 

Consumer Regulation by the CFPB 

The CFPB adopts and administers significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services. Key rules for the Bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices. The latter rules, among other things, establish the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments, credit history, income levels and verification, and so forth. The rules do not prohibit, but do tend to discourage, lenders from originating non-qualified mortgages. 

Data Privacy &#38; Security 

Federal law restricts the Bank&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 14 

and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. Federal law also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards. 

Data privacy and protection increasingly is a significant legislative, regulatory, and societal concern. The concern is driven by major technological and societal shifts in the past 20 years, led by relatively unregulated firms such as Amazon.com, Alibaba, Facebook, and Google and their many customers worldwide. Those firms have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and today have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. These firms seek to understand enough about a person to know what a person wants before the person does. 

Banks (as mentioned above) already are subject to significant privacy regulations. Probably for that reason, the banking industry is not at the political center of these concerns today. Even so, banks are likely to be affected by broader legislative and regulatory responses to the perceived problems. Two prominent responses to date include the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Data Privacy Protection Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain customers. To date, neither has had a material impact on the Bank. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments; DIFA 

U.S. bank deposits generally are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). The system of FDIC insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from 5 to 35 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points annually. Key factors in the grid include: the institution&#8217;s risk category (I to IV); whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex; whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment; and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment. Other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied, including (for example) whether a net loss is realized. A basis point is equal to 0.01%. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 

Depositor Preference 

Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, 

&#160;

in the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of such an institution by any receiver. 

Securities Regulation 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC&#8217;s net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. That rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the broker-dealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate. Compliance with the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading. 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained. 

Insurance Activities 

Certain subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states. Insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted. Although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products, insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states, including, among other things, licensing and marketing and sales practices. 

Compensation and Risk Management 

The Federal Reserve has issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three &#8220;key principles&#8221; calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be backed up by strong corporate governance. In response: we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans; several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenues-only approach; and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs, including an executive program. 

In 2016 federal agencies proposed regulations which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions. The proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size. Institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect. If interpreted aggressively by the regulators, the proposed rules could be used to prevent, as a practical matter, larger institutions from engaging in 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 15 

certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm. In the 2016 proposal, the top two tiers included institutions with more than $50 billion of assets. FHN and the Bank currently would fall into the third tier, where the impact of the proposed rules would be substantially more modest, and would move up to the second tier after the IBKC merger 

&#160;

closes. However, prompted by post-2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory asset-size tiers, if this proposal were finalized now, the $50 billion floor might be raised significantly, allowing FHN to remain in the third tier. FHN cannot predict what final rules may be adopted, nor how they will be implemented. 

##TABLE_START Effect of Governmental Policies 

##TABLE_END

The Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI, and the CFPB. The Federal Reserve also sets and manages monetary policy for the U.S. In this latter role, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s mandate from Congress is to pursue price stability and full employment. 

Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions; changes in the rate paid on banks&#8217; required and excess reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve; and changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. These instruments are intended to influence 

&#160;

economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation. 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of operations of FHN and the Bank, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings. 

##TABLE_START Other Proposals 

##TABLE_END

Bills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress and the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and financial condition. 

&#160;

We are not able to predict what, if any, changes that Congress, state legislatures, or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future, nor the impact that those actions will have upon us. 

##TABLE_START Competition 

##TABLE_END

In all aspects of the businesses in which we engage, we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other firms offering financial products or services. 

Regional Banking 

Our regional banking business primarily competes in several areas within the southeast U.S. where we have banking center locations. However, competition in our industry is trending away from the traditional geographic 

&#160;

footprint model. That trend is happening throughout the industry, but the rate of change is highly uneven among different types of customers, products, and services. 

Our regional banking business serves both consumer and commercial customers. The consumer business remains strongly linked to our physical banking center locations, even as our delivery of financial services to consumers becomes increasingly focused on popular non-physical delivery methods, such as online and mobile banking. Online and mobile banking have contributed to a decline in banking center usage, but not (so far) an erosion of the link between banking center versus consumer customer location. Increasingly, however, consumers are able to manage their funds and financial affairs at multiple 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 16 

financial institutions through only one of them. If cross- institutional management features become popular, they may hasten a de-linking of consumers to traditional banking center networks. 

The commercial business also has a geographic linkage, but it is weaker. Some areas of our commercial banking business, particularly in specialty lending, are broadly regional or even national in scope rather than being heavily centered on banking center locations. 

Key traditional competitors in many of our markets include Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Bank of America N.A., First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (dba First Citizens Bank), Pinnacle Bank (headquartered in Tennessee), Synovus Bank, Truist Bank, and Regions Bank, among many others including many community banks and credit unions. Additional key competitors in south Florida are JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association, PNC Bank National Association, and BankUnited. 

A number of recent technologies created or operated by non-banks have been integrated into the financial systems used by traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of incrementally evolutionary technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks. Prior methods of delivering those services were disrupted, but often at a pace which all but the weakest banks could accommodate. 

Recently, some evolutionary pressures have arisen which may prove to be less incremental and more disruptive. For example, in financial planning and wealth management, companies that are not traditional banks, including both long-established firms (such as Vanguard) and new ones (such as Betterment), have developed highly-interactive systems and applications. These services compete directly with traditional banks in offering personal financial advice. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; services can be especially attractive to younger, less- 

&#160;

affluent customers and potential customers. We and other traditional banks offer similar services, but doing so risks cannibalizing traditional business models for these services. 

In recent years, certain financial companies or their affiliates that traditionally were not banks have been able to compete more directly with the Bank for deposits and other traditional banking services and products. Increased fluidity across traditional boundaries is likely to continue. Non-traditional companies competing with us for traditional banking products and services include investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance company affiliates, peer-to-peer lending arrangers, non-bank deposit acceptors, companies offering payment facilitation services (such as PayPal and pre-paid debit card issuers), and extremely short-term consumer loan companies. 

Fixed Income 

Our fixed income business serves institutional customers, broadly segregated into depositories (including banks, thrifts, and credit unions) and non-depositories (including money managers, insurance companies, governmental units and agencies, public funds, pension funds, and hedge funds). Both customer segments are widely dispersed geographically, predominantly within the U.S. We have many competitors within both segments including major U.S. and international securities firms as well as numerous regional and local firms. 

Additional Information 

For additional information on the competitive position of FHN and the Bank, refer to the &#8220;General&#8221; subsection above of this Item 1. Also, refer to the subsections entitled &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Effect of Governmental Policies,&#8221; both of which are relevant to an analysis of our competitors. Due to the intense competition in the financial services industry we can make no representation that our competitive position has or will remain constant, nor can we predict how it may change in the future.
