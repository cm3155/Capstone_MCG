Supplemental Risk Factor Disclosures related to COVID-19 

The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, has adversely affected FHN&#8217;s ability to conduct normal business, has adversely affected FHN customers, and is likely to harm FHN&#8217;s businesses and future results of operations. 

In December 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China, and has since spread to most countries in the world, including the United States. Starting in late February 2020, financial market volatility increased dramatically based on concerns that COVID-19, and the steps being undertaken in many countries to mitigate its spread, would significantly disrupt economic activity. 

In March 2020, financial market volatility increased further, with several one-day stock market swings that resulted in significant market declines. Additionally, in March: market pricing deteriorated in virtually all sectors and asset classes except U.S. Treasury securities; the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic; the U.S. President declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a national emergency, allowing several federal disaster programs to be accessed by states and cities; many states and cities in the U.S. declared health emergencies, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and quarantines, prohibiting gatherings of more than a small number of people and ordering or urging most businesses and workplaces to close or operate on a very restricted basis; the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates twice and started a &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit; the effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates; and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation which, among other things, is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure 

&#160;

from government and public actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate an economic recession which has not been officially declared but is widely believed to have begun in March. Government programs instituted recently include loan programs administered by banks and other private-sector lenders, liquidity programs administered by the U.S. Treasury, and favorable accounting and regulatory treatment (for lenders) of certain loan payment deferrals. 

The economic effects of these and related actions and events in the U.S. have included: large numbers of partial or full business closures; large numbers of people being furloughed or laid off; large increases in unemployment; large numbers of workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home; large numbers of businesses at risk of insolvency as revenues drop off precipitously, especially in businesses related to travel, leisure, and physical personal services; large numbers of investors realizing substantial losses in their portfolios and retirement funds; and large numbers of consumers being unwilling to undertake significant discretionary spending. In addition, worldwide demand for oil has fallen sharply in conjunction with the pandemic resulting in sharp drops in oil prices and sharp drops in the values of oil-related assets. Further, certain banking organizations globally have limited share buybacks and other capital actions. The most significant effects already experienced by FHN, and actions already taken by FHN, are mentioned in Part I, Item 2 of this report under the captions &#8220;Financial Summary,&#8221; &#8220;Income Statement Review,&#8221; &#8220;Asset Quality,&#8221; and &#8220;Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends,&#8221; beginning on pages 81, 83, 94, and 112 of this report, respectively. 

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the businesses of FHN for the remainder of 2020 or afterward. FHN&#8217;s efforts to mitigate

the adverse impacts of COVID-19 may not be effective, and in any case are likely to be only a partial mitigate. The full extent of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other events beyond the control of FHN will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and further actions taken to prevent, treat, or mitigate the spread of COVID-19, among others. Moreover, global markets for oil and gas have been, and may continue to be, severely impacted by events beyond the control of FHN. The current low commodity prices, especially if sustained, could have a negative impact on the economies of several states in which FHN conducts business, as well as FHN&#8217;s customers, businesses, and assets in those states. 

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in business disruption to FHN, and if unable to recover from such a business disruption on a timely basis, FHN&#8217;s businesses, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. The efforts to integrate the businesses of IBKC and those of FHN may also be delayed and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and become more costly. FHN may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could adversely affect FHN&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in interest rates due to Federal Reserve actions and market forces, mentioned above, are likely to negatively impact FHN&#8217;s net interest margin (a measure of the average profit margin applicable to 

&#160;

lending). In addition, &#8220;spreads&#8221; (the difference between U.S. Treasury borrowing rates and private sector borrowing rates) have widened. For new loans, wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression. However, FHN will not be able to capture the widened spreads quickly for outstanding floating-rate loans: for loans pre-dating the COVID-19 crisis, spreads are fixed by the loan contracts based on pre-COVID pricing. 

FHN&#8217;s customers have been adversely impacted by governmental and societal responses to COVID-19; those impacts are likely to adversely affect FHN&#8217;s noninterest income from loans and deposits as well as create downward loan migration (a reduction in loan-grading) and a corresponding increase in loan loss provision expense and reserves. In addition, loan charge-offs likely will increase over time, especially if economic disruption related to COVID-19 continues for more than a few months. 

In the U.S., initial government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were intended mainly to slow the spread of illness, regardless of the impact on economic activity. As governments relax restrictions in an effort re-invigorate the economy, it is not clear how well or how quickly the economy will recover. Substantial uncertainty regarding COVID-19, and the resulting economic damage, likely will continue until a substantial percentage of the population no longer fears contracting it.
