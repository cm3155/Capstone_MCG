For the purpose of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; are used to refer to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiary, New York Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). 

&#160;

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING LANGUAGE 

This report, like many written and oral communications presented by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. 

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of the words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;strive,&#8221; &#8220;try,&#8221; or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; or similar expressions. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations as reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will be achieved or realized. 

Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans and strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. 

There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in our forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:

&#8226; other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, technological, and geopolitical factors affecting our operations, pricing, and services. 

&#160;

In addition, the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control. 

Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, we evaluate opportunities to expand through mergers and acquisitions and opportunities for strategic combinations with other banking organizations. Our evaluation of such opportunities involves discussions with other parties, due diligence, and negotiations. As a result, we may decide to enter into definitive arrangements regarding such opportunities at any time. 

In addition to the risks and challenges described above, these types of transactions involve a number of other risks and challenges, including: 

&#8226; the ability to successfully integrate branches and operations and to implement appropriate internal controls and regulatory functions relating to such activities; 

&#8226; the ability to limit the outflow of deposits, and to successfully retain and manage any loans; 

&#8226; the ability to attract new deposits, and to generate new interest-earning assets, in geographic areas that have not been previously served;

RECONCILIATIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, 

AND TANGIBLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY; 

TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

(unaudited) 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons: 

1. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. 

2. Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. 

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity; our total assets and tangible assets; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:

Second Quarter 2022 Overview 

At June 30, 2022, total assets were $63.1 billion, up $3.6 billion or 12% annualized compared to December 31, 2021, and up $2.1 billion or 14% annualized compared to March 31, 2022. Both the year-to-date and linked-quarter growth was driven by significant loan and deposit growth, offset partially by a decline in wholesale borrowings. 

Total loans held for investment increased $2.8 billion or 12% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and were up $1.8 billion or 15% annualized on a linked-quarter basis to $48.5 billion. This was driven by continued strong growth in the Company's core multi-family loan portfolio and a significant rebound in growth in the specialty finance loan portfolio. 

On the liability side, total deposits rose $6.2 billion or 35% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and increased $3.3 billion during the second quarter, to $41.2 billion, also up 35% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. Once again, the deposit growth was driven by our BaaS business and loan-related deposits. 

Given the strong deposit growth during the second quarter, wholesale borrowings declined to $13.7 billion at June 30, 2022, down $2.3 billion or 28% annualized compared to December 31, 2021, and down $1.0 billion on a linked-quarter basis, also down 28% annualized, 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company reported net income of $171 million, up 13% compared to the $152 million the Company reported for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $163 million, also up 13% compared to the $144 million the Company reported for three months ended June 30, 2021. Diluted EPS were $0.34 for the three months ended June 30, 2022, up 13% compared to the $0.30 the Company reported for the three months ended June 30, 2021. 

Included for the three months ended June 30, 2022 are $4 million in merger-related expenses compared to $10 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Also included for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was a revaluation on our deferred taxes related to a change in the New York State tax rate of $2 million compared to no such item in the current second quarter. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, net income totaled $326 million compared to $297 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, up 10%. Net income available to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $310 million, up 10% compared to $281 million the Company reported for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Diluted EPS for the six months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $0.66, up 10% compared to diluted EPS of $0.60 the Company reported for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Included in the six months ended June 30, 2022 are $11 million in merger-related expenses compared to $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Also included in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was the aforementioned $2 million related to the revaluation on our deferred taxes related to a change in the New York State tax rate. 

The key trends in the second quarter of 2022 were: 

Record Growth in Deposits 

Total deposits at June 30, 2022 were $41.2 billion, up $3.3 billion or 35% annualized compared to March 31, 2022 and up $6.2 billion compared to December 31, 2021, also up 35%. The two biggest contributors to this quarter's growth were our BaaS business and deposits from our borrowers. 

BaaS-related deposits rose $2.3 billion or 43% on a linked-quarter basis and $5.8 billion on a year-to-date basis to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2022. Loan-related deposits totaled $4.9 billion at June 30, 2022, up $494 million or 44% annualized on a linked-quarter basis and $921 million or 46% annualized during the first six months of the year. For all of 2021, loan-related deposits increased $475 million and all in, since re-focusing on this source of deposit funding during the first quarter of last year, loan-related deposits have grown $1.4 billion, up 39%. 

&#160;

Another Strong Quarter of Loan Growth 

At June 30, 2022, total loans and leases held for investment increased to $48.5 billion, up $1.8 billion or 15% annualized on a linked-quarter basis and $2.8 billion or 12% annualized on a year-to-date basis. Loan growth during the second quarter of 2022 was the Company's second best on record, second only to the $2.2 billion of loan growth during the fourth quarter of last year. Our loan growth during the current second quarter is attributable to continued strong growth in the multi-family portfolio and a significant rebound in specialty finance lending. 

At June 30, 2022, the multi-family portfolio totaled $36.8 billion, representing $1.0 billion of growth or 11% annualized on a linked-quarter basis and $2.2 billion of growth or 13% annualized on a year-to-date basis. The growth in this segment continues to be driven by market share gains as abates, along with heightened refinancing activity as interest rates increased during the quarter, forcing many borrowers to refinance their properties sooner rather than later. 

The other driver of this quarter's loan growth was the significant rebound in growth in the specialty finance portfolio, driven primarily by higher utilization rates. At June 30, 2022, the specialty finance segment totaled $4.1 billion, up $806 million or 97% annualized on a linked-quarter basis and $638 million or 36% annualized on a year-to-date basis. As of June 30, 2022, total commitments were $6.6 billion, up 16% compared to $5.7 billion at March 31, 2022. Of the June 30th amount, 75% or $5 billion are structured as floating-rate obligations, which have, and will continue to benefit the Company in a rising rate environment. 

A Record Level of Loan Originations 

Loan originations set a new record during the second quarter of 2022. Loan originations for the three months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $5.3 billion, up $1.7 billion or 49% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 and $2.2 billion or 72% compared to the three months June 30, 2021. Second-quarter 2022 originations exceeded the prior quarter's pipeline of $2.5 billion by $2.8 billion, more than double. Approximately 80% of our second quarter originations represented new money to the Bank. In addition, 37% of originations were internal refinances from our portfolio; 39% were external refinances; and 24% represented property transactions. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On July 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on August 18, 2022 to common shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used therein, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies: the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. 

The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company&#8217;s January 1, 2020, adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since December 31, 2019. ASU No. 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under ASC Topic 842. At December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $148 million. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the CECL methodology under ASU Topic 326 and recognized an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of $2 million as a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment from changes in methodology, with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings. Separately, at December 31, 2019, the Company had an allowance for unfunded commitments of $1 million. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an increase in the allowance for unfunded commitments of $13 million as a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings. 

&#160;

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the Company expects to collect. Amortized cost is the unpaid loan balance, net of deferred fees and expenses, and includes negative escrow. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Management estimates the allowance by projecting and multiplying together the probability-of-default, loss-given-default and exposure-at-default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term. Economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and economic forecasts. The Company&#8217;s economic forecast period is 24 months, and afterwards reverts to a historical average loss rate on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, with qualitative adjustments made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels and terms, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in legislation, regulation, policies, administrative practices or other relevant factors. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals. The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions. Each quarter the Company reassesses the appropriateness of the economic forecasting period, the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level, considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and other relevant data shifts over time. 

&#160;

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses. Management believes the products within each of the entity&#8217;s portfolio segments exhibit similar risk characteristics. Smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment. The macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period of 24 months. The Company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast. Beyond this forecast period, the Company reverts to a historical average loss rate. This reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 

&#160;

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as TDR or &#8220;reasonably expected TDR&#8221; (criticized, classified, or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months). In addition, all taxi medallion loans are individually evaluated. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient, expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, less costs to sell as appropriate. 

&#160;

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures was $7 million and $12 million, respectively. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life. The Company examined historical credit conversion factor (&#8220;CCF&#8221;) trends to estimate utilization rates, and chose an appropriate mean CCF based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis involved examination of CCFs over a range of fund-up windows (between 12 and 36 months) and comparison of the mean CCF for each fund-up window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean CCF across fund-up windows made business sense. The Company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans. 

&#160;

When applying this critical accounting policy, we incorporate several inputs and judgments that may be influenced by changes period to period. These include, but are not limited to changes in the economic environment and forecasts, changes in the credit profile and characteristics of the loan portfolio, and changes in prepayment assumptions which will result in provisions to or recoveries from the balance of the allowance for credit losses. 

&#160;

While changes to the economic environment forecasts, and portfolio characteristics will change from period to period, portfolio prepayments are an integral assumption in estimating the allowance for credit losses on our mortgage loan portfolio, are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process. Prepayment assumptions are sensitive to interest rates and existing loan terms and determine the weighted average life of the mortgage loan portfolio. Excluding other factors, as the weighted average life of the portfolio increases or decreases, so will the required amount of the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans. 

&#160;

Balance Sheet Summary 

At June 30, 2022, total assets were $63.1 billion, up $3.6 billion or 12% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and up $2.1 billion or 14% annualized compared to March 31, 2022. Both the year-over-date and linked-quarter growth were driven by significant loan and deposit growth, an increase in cash balances, offset by a decline in wholesale borrowings, while total securities remained relatively unchanged. 

Total loans and leases held for investment increased $2.8 billion or 12% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and $1.8 billion or 15% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. This was due to continued strong growth in the multi-family portfolio combined with a significant rebound in the specialty finance portfolio. Total multi-family loans at June 30, 2022 totaled $36.8 billion, representing growth of $2.2 billion compared to December 31, 2021 or 13% on an annualized basis and $1.0 billion of growth compared to March 31, 2022, up 11% annualized. Total specialty finance loans and leases totaled $4.1 billion at June 30, 2022, up $638 million or 36% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and up $806 million or 97% compared to March 31, 2022. In addition, total specialty finance commitments increased 16% to $6.6 billion compared to $5.7 billion at March 31, 2022. 

Cash balances increased $1.1 billion to $3.3 billion compared to the level at December 31, 2021 and approximately $400 million or 52% annualized compared to March 31, 2022. 

Total securities at June 30, 2022 were $5.7 billion, relatively unchanged compared to both $5.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $5.6 billion at March 31, 2022. 

At June 30, 2022, deposits totaled $41.2 billion, up $6.2 billion or 35% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and $3.3 billion during the current second quarter, also up 35% on a linked-quarter basis. Both the linked-quarter and year-to-date increases were driven by our BaaS business and growth in loan-related deposits. BaaS-related deposits totaled $7.8 billion at June 30, 2022, up $2.3 billion or 43% on a linked-quarter basis, while loan-related deposits totaled $4.9 billion, up $494 million on a linked-quarter basis and $921 million on a year-to-date basis. 

BaaS-related deposits fall primarily under three categories: traditional BaaS, consisting primarily of fintech company deposits; government banking as a service, servicing various municipalities and the U.S. Treasury's prepaid debit card program; and mortgage as a service, which caters to mortgage banking and servicing companies and consists of escrow deposits for principal, interest, and tax payments. At June 30, 2022, traditional BaaS deposits totaled $5.5 billion; government banking as a service totaled $652 million; and mortgage as a service totaled $1.6 billion of deposits. 

Wholesale borrowings at June 30, 2022 totaled $13.7 billion, down $2.3 billion or 28% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and down $1.0 billion on a linked-quarter basis, also down 28%. 

Total stockholders' equity at June 30, 2022 was $6.8 billion, down $220 million or 6% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and down $85 million or 5% annualized compared to March 31, 2022. Excluding goodwill and preferred stock, tangible common stockholders' equity totaled $3.9 billion, relatively unchanged compared to $4.0 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Book value per common share stood at $13.56 as of June 30, 2022 compared to $13.72 at March 31, 2022 and $14.07 at December 31, 2021, while tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2022 was $8.35 compared to $8.52 at March 31, 2022 and $8.85 at December 31, 2021. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and Leases Originated for Investment 

The majority of the loans we originate are loans and leases held for investment and most of the held-for-investment loans we produce are multi-family loans. Our production of multi-family loans began over five decades ago in the five boroughs of New York City, where the majority of the rental units currently consist of non-luxury, rent-regulated apartments featuring below-market rents. In addition to multi-family loans, our portfolio of loans held for investment contains a number of CRE loans, most of which are secured by income-producing properties located in New York City and Long Island. 

In addition to multi-family and CRE loans, our specialty finance loans and leases have become an increasingly larger portion of our overall loan portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio includes smaller balances of C&#38;I loans, one-to-four family loans, ADC loans, and other loans held for investment. The majority of C&#38;I loans consist of loans to small- and mid-size businesses. 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, total loans and leases originated for investment were $5.3 billion, up $2.2 billion or 72% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and exceeded the previous quarter's pipeline by $2.8 billion or 107%. On a year-over-year basis, multi-family originations rose $861 million or 41% to $2.9 billion, while specialty finance originations increased $1.3 billion or 210% to $1.9 billion. CRE originations increased 204% or $143 million to $213 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2022.

Loans and Leases Held for Investment 

The individual held-for-investment loan portfolios are discussed in detail below. 

Multi-Family Loans 

Multi-family loans are our principal asset. The loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury residential apartment buildings in New York City that are rent-regulated and feature below-market rents&#8212;a market we refer to as our &#8220;Primary Lending Niche.&#8221; The majority of our multi-family loans are made to long-term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to rent regulation and feature below-market rents. 

At June 30, 2022, total multi-family loans represented $37 billion or 76% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

At June 30, 2022, 72% of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings in the New York City metro area and 3% were secured by buildings elsewhere in New York State. The remaining multi-family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets, including in the four other states in which we operate. 

In addition, 61% or $22.5 billion of the Company's overall multi-family portfolio is secured by properties in New York State, of which $19.7 billion are subject to rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the rent-regulated segment of the multi-family portfolio was 56.66%, as of June 30, 2022, 372 bps below the overall multi-family weighted average LTV of 60.38%. 

Our emphasis on multi-family loans is driven by several factors, including their structure, which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree. Another factor driving our focus on multi-family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce. Reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing status have actually resulted in losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn. 

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. The sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market, as well as general economic conditions, and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 125% on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75% of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, some of our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

At June 30, 2022, CRE loans represented $7 billion or 14% of total loans and leases held for investment, unchanged compared to the previous quarter. 

The CRE loans originated by the Company are also secured by income-producing properties, such as office buildings, mixed-use buildings (retail storefront on the ground floor and apartment units above the ground floor), retail centers, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At June 30, 2022, 83% of our CRE loans were secured by properties in the New York City metro area, while properties in other parts of New York State accounted for 3% of the properties securing our CRE loans and properties in all other states accounted for 15% combined. 

Specialty Finance Loans and Leases 

At June 30, 2022, specialty finance loans and leases totaled $4.1 billion or 9% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable lease. Asset-based and dealer floor-plan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to SOFR or LIBOR-replacement rates, while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over Treasuries. 

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

C&#38;I Loans 

At June 30, 2022, C&#38;I loans totaled $549 million or 1% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

The C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses in the five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 

A broad range of C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

The interest rates on our other C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on other C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

ADC loans at June 30, 2022 totaled $195 million and represented 0.40% of total loans and leases held for investment. Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the business cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At June 30, 2022, one-to-four family loans totaled $129 million or 0.27% of total loans and leases held for investment. These loan balances include certain mixed-use CRE with less than five residential units classified as one-to-four family loans. 

&#160;

Other Loans 

Other loans totaled $6 million at June 30, 2022 and consisted mainly of overdraft loans and loans to non-profit organizations. We currently do not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit. 

Lending Authority 

The loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies approved by the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $3 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $3 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and Specialty Finance loans regardless of amount are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, and C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and Specialty Finance in excess of $15 million are also required to be presented to the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee of the Board, as applicable so that the Committees can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks. The Commercial Credit and Mortgage and Real Estate Committees have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

The Board of Directors updated certain aspects of the Company's lending authority as detailed below. These changes were effective as of July 21, 2021. 

Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans less than or equal to $10 million and C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $5 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $10 million are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $50 million and C&#38;I loans in excess of $10 million are also required to be presented to the Board Credit Committee of the Board, so that the Committee can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks and approve the credit. The Board Credit Committee has authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

In addition, all loans of $50 million or more originated by the Bank continue to be reported to the Board of Directors. 

At June 30, 2022, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $329 million multi-family loan collateralized by six properties located in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination.

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recorded when received in cash. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all of our non-performing loans were non-accrual loans. 

We monitor non-accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area, which is defined as including: (a) the counties that comprise our CRA Assessment area, and (b) the entirety of the following states: Arizona; Florida; New York; New Jersey; Ohio; and Pennsylvania, in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising the collateral properties; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and/or retained legal counsel, as applicable; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance; monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed; and appointing a receiver, whenever possible, to collect rents, manage the operations, provide information, and maintain the collateral properties. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing loans, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, in the event that such a loan is 90 days or more past due, and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is generally not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. We do not analyze LTVs on a portfolio-wide basis. 

&#160;

Non-performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank, as applicable. Collateral-dependent non-performing loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers. 

Properties and assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as either OREO or repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property/asset. Subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO or repossessed assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment (in accordance with our Environmental Risk Policy) of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise the properties/assets on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties/assets as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s or asset&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to closing, with a member of the Board Credit Committee participating in inspections on multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans to be originated in excess of $50 million. We continue to conduct inspections as per the aforementioned policy, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently full access to some properties and buildings may be limited. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. In many cases, a second independent appraisal review is performed. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain new rent regulation laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time. While our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 125% for multi-family loans and 130% for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75% of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65% on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at June 30, 2022. Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160;

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130% and a maximum LTV of 65%. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. Furthermore, in the case of multi-family loans, the cash flows generated by the properties are generally below-market and have significant value. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75% of the estimated as-completed market value of multi-family and residential tract projects; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80%. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65% of the estimated as-completed market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation. 

Other C&#38;I loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower&#8217;s business, and are generally collateralized by various business assets, including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable. As a result, the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful. Furthermore, the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, and may fluctuate in value, based upon the operating results of the business. Accordingly, personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other C&#38;I loans. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings.

(1) Does not include any past due taxi medallion-related loans at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

&#160;

During the second quarter of 2022, total loans 30-89 days past due decreased to $30 million compared to $67 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to two multi-family loans that became current during the six months ending June 30, 2022. 

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing or as an accruing TDR, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can adversely impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. 

Based upon all relevant and available information as of the end of the current second quarter, management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date. 

At June 30, 2022, the Company's three largest NPLs were two CRE loans with balances of $19 million and $8 million and one multi-family loan of $7 million. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, we have selectively extended to certain borrowers such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates, as well as forbearance agreements, when such borrowers have exhibited financial difficulty. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. 

The eligibility of a borrower for work-out concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction, which may change from period to period, and involve management&#8217;s judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the Company. 

Loans modified as TDRs are placed on non-accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. This generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. At June 30, 2022, non-accrual TDRs included taxi medallion-related loans with a combined balance of $4 million. 

At June 30, 2022, loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extensions of maturity dates totaled $45 million. 

Based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms, our success rates for restructured CRE and multi-family loans, was 100%. The success rates for restructured one-to-four family and other loans were 100% and 32%, respectively, at June 30, 2022.

On a limited basis, we may provide additional credit to a borrower after a loan has been placed on non-accrual status or classified as a TDR if, in management&#8217;s judgment, the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, no such additions were made. Furthermore, the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of non-payment of a restructured loan. 

&#160;

Except for the non-accrual loans and TDRs disclosed in this filing, we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case.

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock, and to the extent FHLB borrowings are utilized, may further invest in FHLB stock. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank held FHLB-NY stock in the amount of $635 million and $734 million, respectively. FHLB-NY stock continued to be valued at par, with no impairment required at that date. 

Dividends from the FHLB-NY to the Bank totaled $8 million and $8 million, respectively, in the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in Non-Interest Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, our investment in BOLI increased $8 million to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021. 

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our Consolidated Statements of Condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company (i.e., the Company on an unconsolidated basis) has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Company by the Bank; capital raised through the issuance of stock; and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Loan repayments and sales totaled $6.0 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022, up $1.6 billion from the $4.4 billion recorded in the year-earlier six months. Cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled $397 million and $931 million, respectively, in the corresponding periods, while purchases of securities totaled $788 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. 

&#160;

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. From time to time, we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits, depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

At June 30, 2022, total deposits were $41.2 billion, up $3.3 billion compared to total deposits at March 31, 2022, and up $6.2 billion since December 31, 2021. At June 30, 2022, total deposits represented 65.4% of total assets compared to 62.2% at March 31, 2022 and 58.9% at December 31, 2021. Additionally, at June 30, 2022, CDs represented 19.6% of total deposits versus 20.8% at March 31, 2022 and 24.0% at December 31, 2021. 

Included in the June 30, 2022 balance of deposits were business institutional deposits of $1.9 billion and municipal deposits of $597 million, as compared to $1.4 billion and $751 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Also, included in the June 30, 2022 balance of deposits was $7.8 billion of BaaS-related deposits up $5.8 billion from December 31, 2021. Brokered deposits remained stable at $4.5 billion, including brokered interest-bearing checking accounts of $467 million at June 30, 2022 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021, brokered money market accounts of $2.9 billion at June 30, 2022 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021, and brokered CDs of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2022 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors, including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources, and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds. 

The following table indicates the amount of time deposits, by account, that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000) by time remaining until maturity as of June 30, 2022:

Borrowed Funds 

Borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings (i.e., FHLB-NY advances, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased) and, to a far lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. As of June 30, 2022, borrowed funds declined $2.3 billion or 27% annualized to $14.3 billion compared to December 31, 2021, and represented 23% of total assets at that date. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wholesale borrowings, consisting primarily of FHLB-NY advances, which declined to $13.7 billion compared to $15.9 billion at year-end 2021. Also included in wholesale borrowings are repurchase agreements of $800 million, unchanged from the balance at December 31, 2021. 

Subordinated Notes 

On November 6, 2018, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2028. The Company has used $278 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program, and may use the balance of the offering towards the repurchase of its common stock or for other general corporate purposes. The Notes were offered to the public at 100% of their face amount. At June 30, 2022, the balance of subordinated notes was $296 million, which excludes certain costs related to their issuance. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $361 million at June 30, 2022, comparable to the balance at December 31, 2021. 

&#160;

Risk Definitions 

The following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, and how the Company manages market and interest rate risk: 

Interest Rate Risk &#8211; Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting Company activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in a bank&#8217;s products (options risk). The evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex, illiquid hedging strategies or products, and also the potential impact on fee income (e.g. prepayment income) which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. In those situations where trading is separately managed, this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios. 

Market Risk &#8211; Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodities markets. Many banks use the term &#8220;price risk&#8221; interchangeably with market risk; this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, and volatilities) that affect the value of traded instruments. The primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation (e.g., trading accounts for securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange products). 

Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a bank&#8217;s inability to meet its obligations when they become due, without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk also arises from a bank&#8217;s failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. 

Management of Market and Interest Rate Risk 

We manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The asset and liability management process has three primary objectives: to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; to determine the appropriate level of risk, given our business strategy, risk appetite, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives; and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Market and Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Boards of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

We manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: continue to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans; continue to originate certain floating rate C&#38;I loans; depending on funding needs, replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings; and as needed, execute interest rate swaps. 

LIBOR Transition Process 

The discontinuation of LIBOR has been developing since 2017 when the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) first called for LIBOR to be phased out by 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administration, the publisher of LIBOR discontinued publication of the one-week and two-month US Dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and will discontinue publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month U.S Dollar LIBORs on June 30, 2023, although its use for new business was restricted after December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions. 

&#160;

In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association announced fallback language for derivative contracts incorporating SOFR, as well as a process by which counterparties to such contracts could elect to apply the fallback language to existing derivatives on or after January 25, 2021. SOFR was identified by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group of private-market participants convened to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR in the United States, as the recommended replacement to US Dollar LIBOR in the United States. The adoption of the fallback protocols does not change the index for subject agreements from LIBOR to SOFR, but simply creates the legal framework for the appropriate mechanisms to occur in the future. 

The Bank established a sub-committee of ALCO to address issues related to the phase out and transition away from LIBOR. The sub-committee is led by our Chief Financial Officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the Bank. The Company has identified certain LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023, which may include loans and leases, securities, wholesale borrowings, derivative financial instruments, and long-term debt. The sub-committee has reviewed the associated contracts and legal agreements for conformance to the ARRC aligned fallback language and noted that certain contracts will require some form of standardization in accordance with LIBOR transition recommended fallback provisions. 

The FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. In accordance with guidance, as of after December 31, 2021 the Bank does not offer LIBOR indexed products. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are &#8220;interest rate sensitive&#8221; and by monitoring a bank&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity &#8220;gap.&#8221; An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. 

At June 30, 2022, our one-year gap was a negative 26.14%, compared to a negative 7.43% at December 31, 2021. The change in our one-year gap from December 31, 2021, primarily reflects an increase in borrowings that will mature or are projected to get put back to the Company and an increase in new deposit balances that are indexed to short term rates. 

The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 2022 which, based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience, are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of (1) the term to repricing, or (2) the contractual terms of the asset or liability. 

The table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. For residential mortgage-related securities, prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average CPR of 6.99% per annum; for multi-family and CRE loans, prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average CPRs of 8.69% and 7.25% per annum, respectively. Borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay. 

Savings, interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience. Based on the results of this analysis, savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 67% for the first five years and 33% for years six through ten. Interest-bearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 85% for the first five years and 15% for years six through ten. The decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low 

&#160;

interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior. Including those accounts having specified repricing dates, money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 79% for the first five years and 21% for years six through ten.

(1) For the purpose of the gap analysis, loans held for sale, non-performing loans and the allowances for loan losses have been excluded. 

(2) Mortgage-related and other securities, including FHLB stock, are shown at their respective carrying amounts. 

(3) Expected amount based, in part, on historical experience. 

(4) The interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap. While we believe our assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity. 

To validate our prepayment assumptions for our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, we perform a quarterly analysis, during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates. We continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible, since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on one-to-four family loans tend to be. In addition, we review the call provisions, if any, in our borrowings and investment portfolios and, on a monthly basis, compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable. 

As of June 30, 2022, the impact of a 100 bp decline in market interest rates would have increased our projected prepayment rates for multi-family and CRE loans by a constant prepayment rate of 2.90% per annum. 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the 

&#160;

table. Also, the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates. 

Interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates, and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2022, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

&#160;

(1) The impact of a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the limits approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

As with the Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE Analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not consider the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Accordingly, while the EVE Analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

We also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk. The simulation incorporates various market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2022, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged. 

(2) The impact of a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

&#160;

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap, NPV, and/or net interest income simulation. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

&#8226; Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

&#8226; In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#8226; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#8226; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#8226; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#8226; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At June 30, 2022, our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a (4.32)% decrease in net interest income; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 13.38% increase in net interest income. It should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated, given the changing market rate environment, which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity in the steepening scenario. 

Liquidity, Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Capital Position 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $3.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As in the past, our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in 2022, with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling $6.0 billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling $397 million. 

Additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings. In addition, we have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY. The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At June 30, 2022, our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY was $12.2 billion. In addition, the Bank had available-for-sale securities of $5.7 billion, of which, $4.6 billion is unpledged. 

Furthermore, the Bank has agreements with the FRB-NY that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity. In connection with these agreements, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow. At June 30, 2022, the maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY was $1.1 billion. There were no borrowings against these lines of credit at June 30, 2022. 

&#160;

Our primary investing activity is loan production, and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled $8.8 billion in 2022. During this time, the net cash used in investing activities totaled $3.1 billion; the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled $399 million. Our financing activities provided net cash of $3.7 billion. 

CDs due to mature or reprice in one year or less from June 30, 2022 totaled $6.1 billion, representing 76% of total CDs at that date. Our ability to attract and retain retail deposits, including CDs, depends on numerous factors, including, among others, the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels; our customers&#8217; satisfaction with the service they receive; the rates of interest we offer; the types of products we feature; and the attractiveness of their terms. 

Our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors, including, among others, our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

The Parent Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may also depend, in part, upon dividends it receives from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the Parent Company is generally limited by New York State Banking Law and regulations, and by certain regulations of the FDIC. In addition, the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;), the FDIC, and the FRB, for reasons of safety and soundness, may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations. 

Under New York State Banking Law, a New York State-chartered stock-form savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. However, the approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In 2022, the Bank paid dividends totaling $190 million to the Parent Company, leaving $573 million that it could dividend to the Parent Company without regulatory approval at year-end. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Parent Company at June 30, 2022 included $133 million in cash and cash equivalents. If the Bank was to apply to the Superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations, there can be no assurance that such application would be approved. 

&#160;

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer CDs with contractual terms to our customers, and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB-NY and various brokerage firms. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At June 30, 2022, we had CDs of $8.1 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of $12.6 billion. 

At June 30, 2022, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit, totaling $4.9 billion. These off-balance sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. 

The letters of credit we issue consist of performance stand-by, financial stand-by, and commercial letters of credit. Financial stand-by letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions, municipalities, or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers, and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation. Performance stand-by letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers. Performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non-financial contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer. Although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions, the majority are used to settle payments in international trade. Typically, such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction, and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

&#160;

Based upon our current liquidity position, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

At June 30, 2022, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Capital Position 

On March 17, 2017, we issued 515,000 shares of preferred stock. The offering generated capital of $503 million, net of underwriting and other issuance costs, for general corporate purposes, with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the Bank. 

On October 24, 2018, the Company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved a $300 million common share repurchase program. The repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has repurchased a total of 29.7 million shares at an average price of $9.61 or an aggregate purchase price of $285 million, leaving $10 million remaining under the current authorization. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity includes AOCL, which decreased $368 million from the balance at the end of last year and $379 million from the year-ago quarter to $453 million at June 30, 2022. The year-to-date decrease was primarily the result of a $391 million change in the net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and a $23 million change in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges, net of tax, to $14 million. 

Regulatory Capital 

The Bank is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the NYSDFS and the FDIC (the &#8220;Regulators&#8221;). The Bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Such classifications are used by the FDIC to determine various matters, including prompt corrective action and each institution&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the Regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings, among other factors. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At June 30, 2022, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following table sets forth our common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, at that date:

At June 30, 2022, our total risk-based capital ratio exceeded the minimum requirement for capital adequacy purposes by 400 bps and the fully-phased in capital conservation buffer by 150 bps. 

&#160;

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50%; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5.00%. 

Earnings Summary for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, net income totaled $171 million, up 13% compared to the $152 million the Company reported for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $163 million, up 13% compared to the $144 million the Company reported for the three months ended June 30, 2021. On a per share basis, diluted EPS were $0.34 for the three months ended June 30, 2022, up 13% compared to the $0.30 the Company reported for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Both net income and net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2022 include merger-related expenses of $3 million, net of income tax, while the three months ended June 30, 2021 includes merger-related expenses of $10 million, net of income tax and a $2 million revaluation of the Company's deferred taxes due to a change in the New York State tax rate. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

Net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multi-family and CRE loans, as well as securities. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. 

Year-Over-Year Comparison 

Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $359 million, up $28 million or 8% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by a $42 million or 10% increase in interest income offset by a $14 million or 14% increase in interest expense. 

&#160;

Details of the change in net interest income are as follows: 

&#8226; Interest income on loans and leases rose $38 million or 10% to $424 million on a year-over-year basis and interest income on interest-earning cash and cash equivalents rose $7 million to $9 million, while interest income on securities declined $3 million to $40 million. 

&#8226; The year-over-year improvement in interest income was due to a $4.0 billion or 8% increase in average assets to $57.0 billion, mainly due to a significant increase in average loan balances, along with a seven basis-point improvement in the average yield to 3.32%. 

&#8226; Average loans increased $4.3 billion to $47.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, while the average loan yield increased one basis point to 3.61%. 

&#8226; Average securities balances of $6.7 billion were relatively unchanged, however, the average securities yield declined 15 basis points year-over-year to 2.40%. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average interest-bearing checking and MMAs increased $17 million to $24 million as average balances rose $4.8 billion and the average cost increased 31 basis points to 0.55% on a year-over-year basis. 

&#8226; Interest expense on borrowed funds declined $4 million or 6% to $68 million, year-over-year while average borrowings declined $715 million or 5% to $15.0 billion. 

&#8226; Average non-interest-bearing deposit balances declined $920 million or 17% to $4.6 billion. 

Net Interest Margin 

During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the NIM was 2.52%, up two basis points on a year-over-year basis and up nine basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 

Prepayment income contributed 14 basis points to the current quarter's NIM, up two basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and up six basis points compared to the first quarter of this year. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, the NIM on a non-GAAP basis was 2.38%, up three basis points compared to the second quarter of this year. 

The following table summarizes the contribution of loan and securities prepayment income on the Company&#8217;s interest income and NIM for the respective periods:

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the three-month periods, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

(Recovery of) Provision for Credit Losses 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company reported a provision for credit losses of $9 million compared to a recovery of credit losses of $4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The current quarter's provision largely reflects the strong loan growth the Company experienced during the quarter. 

For additional information about our provisions for and recoveries of loan losses, see the discussion of the allowances for loan losses under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; that appear earlier in this report. 

&#160;

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212;fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; gains on the sale of securities; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, non-interest income totaled $18 million, up 13% on a year-over-year basis. The current second quarter includes a $1.7 million gain on the sale of the Company's former headquarters building in Westbury, N.Y.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the six-month periods, including the 

average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.
