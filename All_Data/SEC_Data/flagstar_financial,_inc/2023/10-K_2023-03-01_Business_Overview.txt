 ITEM 1. B USINESS 

General 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc., (on a stand-alone basis, the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is the bank holding company for Flagstar Bank, N.A. (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company went public in 1993 and has grown organically and through a series of accretive mergers and acquisitions, culminating in its recent acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Flagstar&#8221; or &#8220;Flagstar Bancorp&#8221;), which closed on December 1, 2022. Effective as of December 1, 2022, in connection with the Parent Company&#8217;s acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, (i) Flagstar Bank, FSB converted to a national bank to be known as &#8220;Flagstar Bank, N.A.&#8221; and (ii) New York Community Bank was merged with and into Flagstar Bank N.A., with Flagstar Bank N.A. continuing as the surviving entity. 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. has market-leading positions in several national businesses, including multi-family lending, mortgage originations and servicing, and warehouse lending. The Company is the second-largest multi-family portfolio lender in the country and the leading multi-family portfolio lender in the New York City market area, where it specializes in rent-regulated, non-luxury apartment buildings. Flagstar Mortgage is the 8th largest bank originator of residential mortgages for the 12-months ended December 31, 2022, while we are the industry&#8217;s 6th largest sub-servicer of mortgage loans nationwide, servicing 1.4 million accounts with $346 billion in unpaid principal balances as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company is the 2nd largest mortgage warehouse lender nationally based on total commitments. 

Online Information about the Company and the Bank 

We serve our customers through our website: www.myNYCB.com. In addition to providing our customers with 24-hour access to their accounts, and information regarding our products and services, hours of service, and locations, the website provides extensive information about the Company for the investment community.

In addition, our filings with the SEC (including our annual report on Form 10-K; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and our current reports on Form 8-K), and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available without charge, and are posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. The website also provides information regarding our Board of Directors and management team, as well as certain Board Committee charters and our corporate governance policies. The content of our website shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 

Our Market 

Flagstar Bank, N.A. operates 395 branches across nine states, including strong footholds in the Northeast and Midwest and has exposure to high growth markets in the Southeast and on the West Coast. Flagstar Mortgage operates nationally through a wholesale network of approximately 3,000 third-party mortgage originators. 

The market for the loans we produce varies, depending on the type of loan. For example, the vast majority of our multi-family loans are collateralized by rental apartment buildings in New York City, while the majority of the properties collateralizing our CRE and ADC loans are located in the Northeast and Midwest. Our specialty finance loans and leases are generally made to large corporate obligors that participate in stable industries nationwide and our warehouse loans are made to mortgage lenders across the country. 

&#160; 

Competition for Deposits 

We compete for deposits and customers by placing an emphasis on convenience and service and, from time to time, by offering specific products at competitive rates. In addition to our 395 branches, we have 524 ATM locations that operate 24 hours a day. Our customers also have 24-hour access to their accounts through our mobile banking app, online through our website, www.myNYCB.com , or through our bank-by-phone service. We also offer certain money market accounts, certificates of deposit and checking accounts through a dedicated website: www.myBankingDirect.com. 

In addition to checking and savings accounts, retirement accounts, and CDs for both businesses and consumers, we offer a suite of cash management products to address the needs of small and mid-size businesses and professional associations. We also compete by complementing our broad selection of traditional banking products with an extensive menu of non-deposit investment products and insurance through a relationship with a third-party broker dealer and insurance agency. 

Our ability to attract and retain deposits is not only a function of short-term interest rates and industry consolidation, but also the competitiveness of the rates being offered by other financial institutions within our marketplace, including credit unions, on-line banks, and brokerage firms. Additionally, financial technology companies, also referred to as FinTechs, are providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong competition for deposits and customers. 

Competition for deposits is also influenced by several internal factors, including the opportunity to assume or acquire deposits through business combinations; the cash flows produced through loan and securities repayments and sales; and the availability of attractively priced wholesale funds. In addition, the degree to which we seek to compete for deposits is influenced by the liquidity needed to fund our loan production and other outstanding commitments. 

Competition for Commercial and Consumer Loans and Servicing 

Our success as a lender is substantially tied to the economic health of the markets where we lend. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on loan demand, the value of the collateral securing our credits, and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. 

The competition we face for loans also varies with the type of loan we are originating. In New York City, where the majority of the buildings collateralizing our multi-family loans are located, we compete for such loans on the basis of timely service and the expertise that stems from being a specialist in this lending niche. In addition to the money center, regional, and local banks we compete with in this market, we compete with insurance companies and other types of lenders. Certain of the banks we compete with sell the loans they produce to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Our ability to compete for CRE loans depends on the same factors that impact our ability to compete for multi-family credits, and the degree to which other CRE lenders choose to offer loan products similar to ours. 

Competition for our specialty finance loans, which consist primarily of asset-based, equipment financing, and dealer floor plan loans, is driven by a variety of factors, including prevailing economic conditions and the level of interest rates. Moreover, since a majority of our customers in this category are mid-to-large size publicly traded companies, we also face competition for financing from the capital markets. In addition, the majority of specialty finance loans that we originate are sourced from larger financial institutions who have many customers for these loans. Some of these customers are larger and have more capital and liquidity than the Company. 

While we continue to originate ADC and C&#38;I loans for investment, such loans represent a small portion of our loan portfolio as compared to multi-family, CRE loans, and specialty finance loans. 

From a lending perspective, we compete with many institutions including commercial banks, national mortgage lenders, local savings banks, financial technology companies, credit unions and commercial lenders offering mortgage loans and other consumer loans. 

&#160; 

In servicing, we compete primarily against non-bank servicers. The subservicing market in which we operate is also highly competitive and we face competition related to subservicing pricing and service delivery. We compete by offering quality servicing, a robust risk and compliance infrastructure and a model where our mortgage business allows for recapture services to replenish loans for subservicing clients. 

Monetary Policy 

The Company and the Bank are affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the FRB which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. Among the techniques available to the FRB are engaging in open market transactions of U.S. Government securities, changing the discount rate and changing reserve requirements against bank deposits. These techniques are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits. Their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The effect of government policies on the earnings of the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted. 

Environmental Issues 

We encounter certain environmental risks in our lending activities and other operations. The existence of hazardous materials may make it unattractive for a lender to foreclose on the properties securing its loans. In addition, under certain conditions, lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on such properties. We attempt to mitigate such environmental risks by requiring either that a borrower purchase environmental insurance or that an appropriate environmental site assessment be completed as part of our underwriting review on the initial granting of CRE and ADC loans, regardless of location, and of any out-of-state multi-family loans we may produce. Depending on the results of an assessment, appropriate measures are taken to address the identified risks. In addition, we order an updated environmental analysis prior to foreclosing on such properties, and typically hold foreclosed multi-family, CRE, and ADC properties in subsidiaries. 

Our attention to environmental risks also applies to the properties and facilities that house our bank operations. Prior to acquiring a large-scale property, a Phase 1 Environmental Property Assessment is typically performed by a licensed professional engineer to determine the integrity of, and/or the potential risk associated with, the facility and the property on which it is built. Properties and facilities of a smaller scale are evaluated by qualified in-house assessors, as well as by industry experts in environmental testing and remediation. This two-pronged approach identifies potential risks associated with asbestos-containing material, above and underground storage tanks, radon, electrical transformers (which may contain PCBs), ground water flow, storm and sanitary discharge, and mold, among other environmental risks. These processes assist us in mitigating environmental risk by enabling us to identify and address potential issues, including by avoiding taking ownership or control of contaminated properties. 

Subsidiary A ctivities 

We conduct business primarily through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, N.A. The Bank has formed, or acquired through merger transactions, 33 active subsidiary corporations. Of these, 21 are direct subsidiaries of the Bank and 12 are subsidiaries of Bank-owned entities.

Human Capital Management 

At December 31, 2022, our workforce included 7,497 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations to be in good standing. 

We believe our employees are among our most significant resources and that our employees are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of benefits, both of which we believe are competitive with our industry peers and with other firms in the locations in which we do business. Our employees receive salaries that are subject to annual review and periodic benchmarking. Our benefits program includes a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts and paid time off. Many of our employees are also eligible to participate in the Company&#8217;s equity award program and the Company's annual incentive program. 

We are proud to strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects the demographics of the communities in which we do business. Our company recognizes that the talents of a diverse workforce are a key competitive advantage. To increase diversity within our talent pool, we work with key stakeholders in our business locations to deepen our understanding of the local labor market and better position the organization to recruit and retain talent within under-represented communities. 

We strive to create and foster a supportive environment for all of our employees, and we are proud to share our business success with individuals whose cultural and personal differences support an innovative and productive workplace. Approximately two-thirds of our workforce is female and nearly half of our workforce have diverse ethnic backgrounds. Our policies and practices reflect our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 

A diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. We strive to build and leverage a diverse, inclusive and engaged workforce that inspires all individuals to work together towards a common goal of superior business results by embracing the unique needs and objectives of our customers and community. We strive to achieve this by hiring great people who represent the talents, experiences, background and diversity of the communities we serve. Our commitment is reflected in the policies that govern our workforce, such as our Diversity Pledge and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, and is evidenced in our recruiting strategies, diversity and inclusion training and Employee resource groups, which are key to our efforts. Our Employee resource groups provide our associates access to coaching, mentoring and professional development. As of December 31, 2022, our efforts have been focused on the following eleven employee resource groups which we intend to expand across our recently combined Company: African American, Asian-Indian, Environmental, Hispanic/Latino, Interfaith, LGBTQ, Military Veterans, Native American, People with Disabilities, Women and Young Professionals. 

Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and all employees are required to complete annual training that focuses on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination. 

Federal, State, and Local Taxation 

The Company is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. See the discussion of &#34;Income Taxes&#34; in Note 2, &#34;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#34; 

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and regulations that significantly affect the Company and its subsidiaries. A number of other statutes and regulations may affect the Company and the Bank but are not discussed in the following paragraphs. 

General 

The Bank is a national banking association, subject to federal regulation and oversight by the OCC. The activities of the Bank are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against the Bank for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting the Bank&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank. We are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the extent permitted by law and the requirements established by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to the supervision of the CFPB, which regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws. The OCC, FDIC and the CFPB may take regulatory enforcement actions if we do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against us, or any &#34;institution-affiliated party&#34;, such as a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, if after notice and hearing, we are found to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which to operate and is primarily intended for the protection of depositors and the FDIC's DIF rather than our shareholders. 

As a bank holding company, we are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. We are required to file certain reports, and we are subject to examination by, and the enforcement authority of, the Federal Reserve. Under the federal securities laws, we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Any change to laws and regulations, whether by the Regulatory Agencies or Congress, could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

Enacted in July 2010, the DFA significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will continue to affect, into the immediate future, the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. The DFA is complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, and represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. 

The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 

In 2019, the New York State Legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 impacting about one million rent-regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from material capital improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20 percent vacancy bonus. While it will take several years for its full impact to be known, the legislation generally limits a landlord&#8217;s ability to increase rents on rent-regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rent apartments. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

In 2013, the FRB and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and to address relevant provisions of the DFA. Basel III generally refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009. The Basel III rules generally refer to the rules adopted by U.S. banking regulators in December 2010 to align U.S. bank capital requirements with Basel III and with the related loss absorbency rules they issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. 

The Basel III rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for the purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital in accordance with the following ratios: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent; (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from 4 percent); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from the prior rules); and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent. 

In addition, the Basel III rules assign higher risk weights to certain assets, such as the 150 percent risk weighting assigned to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status, and to certain CRE facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property. Basel III also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from tier 1 capital. In addition, tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are required, subject to limitation, to be deducted from capital. Finally, tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. 

Basel III also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (consisting entirely of common equity tier 1 capital) that is 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. This resulted in an increase in the minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capital ratios to 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, and 10.5 percent, respectively. The capital conservation buffer is now at its fully phased-in level of 2.5 percent. An institution can be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital levels fall below these amounts. Basel III also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such capital distributions. 

On September 17, 2019, the FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a final rule designed to reduce regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies&#8217; regulatory capital rule. Most aspects of the rule apply only to banking organizations that are not subject to the &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; in the capital rule, which are generally firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure. The rule simplifies and clarifies a number of the more complex aspects of the existing capital rule. Specifically, the rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The five capital tiers are described in more detail below. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, an institution that fails to remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth, or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervision authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Basel III rules, new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 percent or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent or greater. 

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4 percent. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3 percent, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3 percent. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 percent. 

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution&#8217;s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the bank&#8217;s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. 

Beginning 60 days after becoming &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see the Capital section of the MD&#38;A and Note 21 - Capital. As of December 31, 2022, each of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulations. 

Stress Testing 

Stress Testing for Category IV U.S. Banking Organizations 

In 2019, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) finalized a framework that sorts large banking organizations into one of four categories of prudential standards based on their risk profiles (the &#8220;tailoring rule&#8221;). The most stringent prudential standards apply under Category I (defined as U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks and their depository institution subsidiaries), and the least stringent prudential standards apply under Category IV (defined as U.S. banking organizations with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total assets and have less than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposure). &#160; 

&#160; 

In January 2021, the Board finalized a rule to update capital planning requirements for large banks to be consistent with the tailoring rule. The Board's capital planning requirements for large banks help ensure they plan for and determine their capital needs under a range of different scenarios. The rule removes the company-run stress test requirement for banking organizations subject to Category IV standards. Therefore, banking organizations subject to Category IV standards are not required to calculate forward-looking projections of capital under scenarios provided by the Board. 

The rule also aligns the frequency of the calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement with the frequency of the supervisory stress test (that is, both would occur every other year for banking organizations subject to Category IV standards). The rule allows a banking organization subject to Category IV standards to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the banking organization would not otherwise be subject to the supervisory stress test, and to receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement in that year. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe, for the depository institutions under its jurisdiction, standards that relate to, among other things, internal controls; information and audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; the monitoring of interest rate risk; asset growth; compensation; fees and benefits; and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) to implement these safety and soundness standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, (the &#8220;FDI Act&#8221;). 

&#160; 

FDIC, OCC, and FRB Regulations 

The discussion that follows pertains to FDIC, OCC, and FRB regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages. 

Additional Regulations 

The following pertains to regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages. 

Real Estate Lending Standards 

The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that prescribe standards for extensions of credit that (i) are secured by real estate, or (ii) are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate. The FDIC regulations require each institution to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities. The standards also must be consistent with accompanying FDIC Guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for the different types of real estate loans. Institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan-to-value limitations as long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately. The FDIC Guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan-to-value standards are justified. 

The FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB (collectively, the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies&#8221;) also have issued joint guidance entitled &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices&#8221; (the &#8220;CRE Guidance&#8221;). The CRE Guidance, which addresses land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans, as well as CRE loans, does not establish specific lending limits but, rather, reinforces and enhances the Federal Banking Agencies&#8217; existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management. Specifically, the CRE Guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in CRE lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key 

&#160; 

elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of CRE lending. 

On December 13, 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, to modify the agencies&#8217; capital rules for high volatility CRE (&#8220;HVCRE&#8221;) exposures, as required by the EGRRCPA. The final rule revises the definition of HVCRE exposure to make it consistent with the statutory definition of the term included in Section 214 of the EGRRCPA, which excludes any loan made before January 1, 2015. The revised HVCRE exposure definition differs from the previous definition primarily in two ways. First, the previous definition applied to loans that financed ADC activities, whereas the new definition only applies to loans that &#8220;primarily&#8221; finance ADC activities and that are secured by land or improved real estate. This change excludes multipurpose credit facilities that primarily finance the purchase of equipment or other non-ADC activities. Second, the new definition permits the full appraised value of borrower-contributed land (less the total amount of any liens on the real property securing the HVCRE exposure) to count toward the 15 percent capital contribution of the real property&#8217;s appraised &#8220;as completed&#8221; value, which is one of the criteria for an exemption from the heightened risk weight. The final rule includes a grandfathering provision, which will provide banking organizations with the option to maintain their current capital treatment for ADC loans originated on or after January 1, 2015, and before April 1, 2020. Banking organizations also will have the option to reevaluate any or all of their ADC loans originated on or after January 1, 2015, using the revised HVCRE exposure definition. 

Dividend Limitations 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to the Company&#8217;s shareholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would require the approval of the OCC if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfer to paid-in capital. The term &#8220;net profits&#8221; is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024. In 2022, dividends of $335 million were paid by the Bank to the Parent Company. At December 31, 2022, the Bank could have paid additional dividends of $615 million to the Parent Company without regulatory approval. 

Investment Activities 

National bank investment activities are governed by the National Bank Act and OCC regulations which, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, prescribe standards under which national banks may purchase, sell, deal in, underwrite, and hold securities. The types of investment activities that are permissible for national banks, and the calculation of limits for investments in such covered securities, are set forth in regulations promulgated by the OCC (12 CFR Part 1), as further described in the OCC&#8217;s Investment Securities Policy Statement (OCC Bulletin 1998-20). A national bank must adhere to safe and sound banking practices and the specific requirements of the OCC's regulations in conducting such investment activities. A bank must consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit, liquidity, price, foreign exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic, and reputation risks presented by a proposed activity, and the particular activities undertaken by the bank must be appropriate for that bank. If the OCC determines for safety and soundness reasons that a bank should calculate its investment limits more frequently than required by the OCC's Investment Securities regulations, the OCC may provide written notice to the bank directing the bank to calculate its investment limitations at a more frequent interval, and the bank must thereafter calculate its investment limits at that interval until further notice from the OCC. 

The GLBA and FDIC regulations also impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a bank&#8217;s dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities. 

&#160; 

Enforcement 

The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders, and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF. The maximum deposit insurance provided by the FDIC per account owner is $250,000 for all types of accounts. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital level, and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments based on the assigned risk levels. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain other factors. Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of the institution&#8217;s assessment base, which is calculated as average total assets minus average tangible equity. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. Deposit insurance assessments are based on total average assets, excluding PPP loans, less average tangible common equity. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Management cannot predict what insurance assessments rates will be in the future. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that would lead to termination of the deposit insurance for the Bank. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulations 

Federal Regulation. The Company is currently subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the BHCA, as administered by the FRB. 

Acquisition, Activities and Change in Control . The Company may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in activities permissible for a bank holding company pursuant to the BHCA. Further, we generally are required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank, bank holding company, savings associations or savings and loan holding company if we would own or control more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of that entity. Additionally, we are prohibited from acquiring control of a depository institution that is not federally insured or retaining control for more than one year after the date that institution becomes uninsured. 

We may not be acquired unless the transaction is approved by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the GLBA generally restricts a company from acquiring us if that company is engaged directly or indirectly in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or financial holding company. 

Capital Requirements. The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the OCC and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization&#8217;s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see the Capital section of the MD&#38;A and Note 21 -Capital. 

Holding Company Limitations on Capital Distributions. Our ability to make any capital distributions to our stockholders, including dividends and share repurchases, is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve and contingent upon their non-objection to such planned distributions which typically considers our capital adequacy, comprehensiveness and effectiveness of capital planning and the prudence of the proposed capital action. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of the Holding Company 

Federal Restrictions 

Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CIBCA&#8221;), a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10 percent or more of the Company&#8217;s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Under the CIBCA, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Company, the Bank; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain &#8220;control&#8221; of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the Company, the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company&#8217;s directors, or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company. Under the BHCA, an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the FRB&#8217;s approval before acquiring more than 5 percent of the Company&#8217;s voting stock. See &#8220;Holding Company Regulation&#8221; earlier in this report. 

Banking Regulation 

Limitation on Capital Distributions . The OCC and FRB regulate all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. An application to the OCC by the Bank may be required based on a number of factors including whether the Bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution or if the total amount of all capital distributions (including each proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024, which could restrict our ability to pay the common stock dividend. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 percent of the institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 percent of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees or acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to, the institution or its subsidiaries as similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains a specific exemption for loans made by an institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with other federal banking laws. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and FRB Regulation O adopted thereunder, govern loans by a bank to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160; 

Federal Regulation 

Under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA generally does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Performance is tested in three areas: (1) lending, to 

&#160; 

evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of making loans in its assessment areas; (2) investment, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (3) service, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of the community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and bank holding company and savings and loan holding company acquisitions. The CRA also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. 

&#160; 

Community Pledge Agreement with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 

On January 24, 2022, the Company and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (&#34;NCRC&#34;) announced the Company's commitment to provide $28 billion in loans, investments, and other financial support to communities and people of color, low- and moderate-income (&#34;LMI&#34;) families and communities, and small businesses. The Company's Community Pledge Agreement was developed with NCRC and its members in conjunction with the Company's merger with Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. The agreement includes $22 billion in community lending and affordable housing commitments and $6 billion of residential mortgage originations to underserved and LMI borrowers, and in LMI and majority-minority neighborhoods over a five-year period. NYCB will also provide $542 million in loans to small businesses with less than $1 million in revenues and in LMI and majority-minority communities; $16.5 million in philanthropic support to nonprofit organizations that meet the needs of LMI and majority-minority communities and individuals; greater access to banking products and services; and the continuation of NYCB's responsible multi-family lending practices. 

Bank Secrecy and Anti-Money Laundering 

The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221; or the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;. The BSA requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The Bank is also required to comply with the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others. The USA PATRIOT Act contains prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to prevent the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires banks and other depository institutions, brokers, dealers and certain other businesses involved in the transfer of money to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements meeting minimum standards specified by the Patriot Act, to follow standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and to compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. 

We have developed and operate an enterprise-wide anti-money laundering program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations. Our anti-money laundering program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries or territories, or with certain individuals or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and other U.S. and non-U.S. sanctions authorities. Our anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage, and mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report potentially suspicious transactions, perform consumer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. Our programs are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. 

&#160; 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals, and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules, based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with, or investment in, a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from, and exports to, a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Data Privacy 

Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The GLBA requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy practices and policies relating to sharing such information and enable retail customers to opt out of the Company&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and imposes certain limitations on the ability to share consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with non-affiliated third-parties. Privacy requirements, including notice and opt out requirements, under the GLBA and the FCRA are enforced by the FTC and by the CFPB through UDAAP laws and regulations, and are a standard component of CFPB examinations. State entities also may initiate actions for alleged violations of privacy or security requirements under state law. 

Furthermore, an increasing number of state, federal, and international jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective on January 1, 2020, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which regulates the collection, control, sharing, disclosure and use and other processing of personal information of data subjects in the EU and the European Economic Area. The CCPA gives residents of California expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and also provides for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches. Meanwhile, the GDPR provides data subjects with greater control over the collection and use of their personal information (such as the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;) and has specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States, with fines for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or up to 4 percent of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company. In addition, California approved a new privacy law in 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers&#8217; rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. 

Cybersecurity 

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (the &#8220;CISA&#8221;) is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. through sharing of information about security threats between the U.S. government and private sector organizations, including financial institutions such as the Company. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems, notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from potential cyber-attacks. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC 

&#160; 

under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having those Officers certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; that they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB-NY capital stock. At December 31, 2022 the Bank held $762 million of FHLB-NY stock and, as a result of the Flagstar acquisition, $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis shares. 

Federal Securities Law 

The Company&#8217;s common stock and certain other securities listed on the cover page of this report are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company is subject to the information and proxy solicitation requirements, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

Consumer Protection Regulations 

The activities of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiary, including its lending and deposit gathering activities, is subject to a variety of consumer laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions, and reputational damage to the financial institution. 

Applicable consumer protection laws, and their implementing regulations, include, but may not be limited to, the DFA, Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), Truth in Savings Act (Regulation DD), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Regulation E), Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Regulation C), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Regulation F), Fair Credit Reporting Act (Regulation V), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, Expedited Funds Availability (Regulation CC), Reserve Requirements (Regulation D), Insider Transactions (Regulation O), Privacy of Consumer Information (Regulation P), Margin Stock Loans (Regulation U), Right To Financial Privacy Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Homeownership Counseling Act. Additionally, we are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) in connection with any consumer financial product or service 

In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. Many states have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, the federal laws listed above, such as usury laws, state debt collection practices laws, and requirements regarding loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, money transmission, recordkeeping, and unfair or deceptive business practices. 

Certain states have adopted laws regulating and requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for parties that engage in certain activity regarding consumer finance transactions. Furthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for consumer debt collection or servicing, and/or purchasing or selling consumer loans. The licensing statutes vary from state to state and prescribe different requirements, including but not limited to: restrictions on loan origination and servicing practices (including limits on the type, amount, and manner of our fees), interest rate limits, disclosure requirements, periodic examination requirements, surety bond and minimum specified net worth requirements, periodic financial reporting requirements, notification requirements for changes in principal officers, stock ownership or corporate control, restrictions on advertising, and requirements that loan forms be submitted for review. We may also be subject 

&#160; 

to supervision and examination by applicable state regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we may offer consumer financial products or services. 

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Bank is subject to oversight by the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was established under the DFA to implement and enforce rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit acts and practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s (a) lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service; (b) the inability of the consumer to protect his/her own interest in selecting or using a financial product or service; or (c) the reasonable reliance by the consumer on a financial institution to act in the interests of the consumer. 

The CFPB has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized, individually or jointly with the federal banking agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings, and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB also may institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as certain of their affiliates. 

The CFPB is also authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB is authorized to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties which, for 2022, range from $6,323 per day for minor violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB&#8217;s own rules) to $31,616 per day for reckless violations and $1,264,622 per day for knowing violations. The CFPB monetary penalty amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). 

In May 2022, the CFPB issued an Interpretive Rule to clarify the authority of states to enforce federal consumer financial protections laws under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;CFPA&#8221;). Specifically, the CFPB confirmed that (1) states can enforce the CFPA, including the provision making it unlawful for covered persons or service providers to violate any provision of federal consumer financial protection law; (2) the enforcement authority of states under section 1042 of the CFPA is generally not subject to certain limits applicable to the CFPB&#8217;s enforcement authority, such that States may be able to bring actions against a broader cross-section of companies than the CFPB; and (3) state attorneys general and regulators may bring (or continue to pursue) actions under their CFPA authority even if the CFPB is pursuing a concurrent action against the same entity. See CFPB Interpretive Rule regarding Section 1042 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (87 FR 31940, May 26, 2022). 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations 

Our mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans&#8217; Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;) and Fannie Mae with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts. Lenders are required annually to submit audited financial statements to Fannie Mae, FHA and VA. Each of these regulatory entities has its 

&#160; 

own financial requirements. We are also subject to examination by Fannie Mae, FHA and VA to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Report Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. Our mortgage banking operations are also affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s Boards of Directors are actively engaged in the process of overseeing the efforts made by the Enterprise Risk Management department to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, and report risk. The Company has established an ERM program that reinforces a strong risk culture to support sound risk management practices. The Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of the ERM program and framework. 

ERM is responsible for setting and aligning the Company&#8217;s Risk Appetite Policy with the goals and objectives set forth in the budget, and the strategic and capital plans. Internal controls and ongoing monitoring processes capture and address heightened risks that threaten the Company&#8217;s ability to achieve our goals and objectives, including the recognition of safety and soundness concerns and consumer protection. Additionally, ERM monitors key risk indicators against the established risk warning levels and limits, as well as elevated risks identified by the Chief Risk Officer. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On January 24, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend was payable on February 16, 2023 to common stockholders of record as of February 6, 2023. 

Mortgage Restructuring 

Legacy Flagstar proactively rightsized its mortgage operation throughout 2022 to adjust for market conditions. The mortgage business is cyclical by nature and challenging conditions are expected to continue throughout 2023. To better reflect demand and align to where our brand strength and familiarity lies, the distributed retail channel will reduce coverage by 69% and shift to a branch footprint only-model. 

We expect that these actions will optimize our mortgage business and improve profitability during the current mortgage down cycle, while still allowing us to participate in the upside once the interest rate cycle becomes favorable. This allows us to maintain a retail presence within our nine-state footprint, leverages our marketing and branding spend, and reduces risk. More importantly, it leaves our position within the mortgage industry intact. We remain one of the largest bank originators, the 6th largest sub-servicer in the country, and the 2nd largest warehouse lender. Moreover, it allows us to continue to lend in all six channels and maintain our commitment to the correspondent and broker business.
