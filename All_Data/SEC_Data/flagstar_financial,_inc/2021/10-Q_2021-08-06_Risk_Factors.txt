 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, readers should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the Company&#8217;s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2021,as such factors could materially affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, or future results of operations. 

The risk factors set forth in our 2020 Form 10-K and in our March 31, 2021 Form 10-Q are updated by the following risks: 

&#160; 

Combining NYCB and Flagstar may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and NYCB may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. 

&#160; 

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of NYCB and Flagstar. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger, NYCB and Flagstar must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If NYCB and Flagstar are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses. 

An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of NYCB following the completion of the merger, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of NYCB following the completion of the merger. 

NYCB and Flagstar have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company&#8217;s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies&#8217; ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of NYCB and Flagstar during this transition period and on NYCB for an undetermined period after completion of the merger. 

&#160; 

Litigation related to the merger has been filed against Flagstar, the Flagstar board of directors, NYCB and the NYCB board of directors, and additional litigation may be filed against Flagstar, the Flagstar board of directors, NYCB and the NYCB board of directors in the future, which could prevent or delay the completion of the merger, result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of NYCB and Flagstar. 

Litigation related to the merger has been filed against Flagstar, the Flagstar board of directors, NYCB and the NYCB board of directors, and additional litigation may be filed against Flagstar, the Flagstar board of directors, NYCB and the NYCB board of directors in the future. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting NYCB or Flagstar from completing the merger, the holdco merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to NYCB and/or Flagstar, including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Further, such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of NYCB and Flagstar. 

&#160; 

The COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on NYCB&#8217;s business and operations following the completion of the merger is uncertain. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of NYCB following the completion of the merger will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the 

&#160; 

COVID-19 pandemic on employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NYCB&#8217;s business, and there is no guarantee that efforts by NYCB to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. 

Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, NYCB may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s global economic impact, including reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any recession or depression that may occur. 

&#160; 

NYCB may be unable to retain NYCB and/or Flagstar personnel successfully after the merger is completed. 

The success of the merger will depend in part on NYCB&#8217;s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by NYCB and Flagstar. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with NYCB or Flagstar, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with NYCB after the merger is completed. If NYCB and Flagstar are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, NYCB and Flagstar could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the merger, if key employees terminate their employment, NYCB&#8217;s business activities may be adversely affected, and management&#8217;s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating NYCB and Flagstar to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause NYCB&#8217;s business to suffer. In addition, NYCB and Flagstar may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company. 

&#160; 

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on NYCB following the merger. 

Before the mergers may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the NYDFS, certain mortgage agencies, and, with respect to the Bank&#8217;s establishment and operation of Flagstar Bank&#8217;s branches and other offices following the effective time of the bank merger, any state bank regulatory authority, and other regulatory authorities. In determining whether to grant these approvals, such regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to: an adverse development in either party&#8217;s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals, including factors not known as of the date of this report and factors that may arise in the future; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity, it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns. 

The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of NYCB&#8217;s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of NYCB following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

In addition, despite the parties&#8217; commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the merger agreement, NYCB will not be required, and Flagstar will not be permitted without NYCB&#8217;s prior written consent, to take actions or agree to conditions in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on NYCB and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger. 

&#160; 

The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. 

The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: (1) approval by Flagstar shareholders of the Flagstar merger proposal and the approval by NYCB&#8217;s stockholders of the NYCB share issuance proposal; (2) authorization for listing on the NYSE of the shares of NYCB common stock; (3) the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the NYDFS, certain mortgage 

&#160; 

agencies, and, with respect to the Bank&#8217;s establishment and operation of Flagstar Bank&#8217;s branches and other offices following the effective time of the bank merger, any state bank regulatory authority, and other regulatory authorities, and no such requisite regulatory approval will have resulted in the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition (as defined in the merger agreement); (4) effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by NYCB and no proceedings for such purpose will have been initiated or threatened by the SEC and not withdrawn; and (5) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint prohibiting the consummation of the merger, the holdco merger or the bank merger issued by any governmental entity being in effect, and no law, statute, rule or regulation having been enacted, promulgated or enforced by any governmental entity which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger, the holdco merger or the bank merger. Each of Flagstar&#8217;s or NYCB&#8217;s obligation to complete the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (b) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement and (c) in the case of Flagstar&#8217;s obligation to complete the merger, receipt by Flagstar of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (d) in the case of NYCB&#8217;s obligation to complete the merger, either (i) the receipt of a similar opinion from its counsel, or (ii) the merger and holdco merger, taken together, reasonably being expected to result in a Material Adverse Tax Consequence (as defined in the merger agreement) to NYCB. 

These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval, as applicable, or NYCB or Flagstar may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances. 

&#160; 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact NYCB. 

If the merger is not completed for any reason there may be various adverse consequences and NYCB may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their respective customers and employees. For example, NYCB&#8217;s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of NYCB common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial and will be completed. NYCB and/or Flagstar also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against NYCB or Flagstar to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, either NYCB or Flagstar may be required to pay a termination fee of $90 million to the other party. 

Additionally, each of NYCB has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, NYCB would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. 

&#160; 

NYCB will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending. 

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on NYCB. These uncertainties may impair NYCB&#8217;s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with NYCB to seek to change existing business relationships with NYCB. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Flagstar has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its business without NYCB&#8217;s consent, and Flagstar and NYCB have agreed to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect their respective ability to consummate the merger on a timely basis without the other&#8217;s consent. These restrictions may prevent NYCB from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. 

&#160; 

The merger agreement limits Flagstar&#8217;s and NYCB&#8217;s respective abilities to pursue alternatives to the merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire NYCB. 

The merger agreement contains &#8220;no shop&#8221; covenants that restrict each of NYCB&#8217;s and Flagstar&#8217;s ability to, directly or indirectly, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by each respective board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $90 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Flagstar or NYCB from considering or proposing that acquisition even if, in the case of a potential acquisition of Flagstar, it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price to Flagstar shareholders than what is contemplated in the merger, or may result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire Flagstar or NYCB than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

NYCB is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration. 

NYCB has incurred and expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and closing the merger. In addition, NYCB will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as NYCB integrates the Flagstar business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Anticipated pre-tax one-time expenses related to the merger are currently estimated to be approximately $220 million. 

There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. NYCB and Flagstar may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. NYCB and Flagstar will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. 

&#160; 

Each current NYCB stockholder will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in NYCB following the consummation of the merger than the holder&#8217;s ownership and voting interest in NYCB individually, as applicable, prior to the consummation of the merger and will exercise less influence over management. 

NYCB stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting NYCB and Flagstar, respectively. When the merger is completed, each NYCB stockholder will become an NYCB stockholder, with a percentage ownership of NYCB that is smaller than the holder&#8217;s percentage ownership of either NYCB individually prior to the consummation of the merger. Based on the number of shares of NYCB common stock and Flagstar common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the respective record dates, and based on the number of shares of NYCB common stock expected to be issued in the merger, the former Flagstar shareholders, as a group, are estimated to own approximately 31% of the outstanding shares of NYCB common stock immediately after the merger and current NYCB stockholders as a group are estimated to own approximately 69% of the outstanding shares of NYCB common stock immediately after the merger. Because of this, Flagstar shareholders may have less influence on the management and policies of NYCB than they now have on the management and policies of Flagstar, and NYCB stockholders may have less influence on the management and policies of NYCB when the merger is completed than they now have on the management and policies of NYCB. 

&#160; 

Issuance of shares of NYCB common stock in connection with the merger may adversely affect the market price of NYCB common stock. 

In connection with the payment of the merger consideration, NYCB expects to issue approximately 212.0 million shares of NYCB common stock to Flagstar shareholders. The issuance of these new shares of NYCB common stock may result in fluctuations in the market price of NYCB common stock, including a stock price decrease
