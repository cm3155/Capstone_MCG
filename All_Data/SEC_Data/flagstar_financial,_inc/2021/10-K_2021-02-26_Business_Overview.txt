 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

General 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc., (on a stand-alone basis, the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was organized under Delaware law on July 20, 1993 and is the bank holding company for New York Community Bank (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). Formerly known as Queens County Savings Bank, the Bank converted from a state-chartered mutual savings bank to the capital stock form of ownership on November 23, 1993, at which date the Company completed its initial offering of common stock (par value: $0.01 per share) at a price of $25.00 per share ($0.93 per share on a split-adjusted basis, reflecting the impact of nine stock splits between 1994 and 2004). 

New York Community Bank 

Established in 1859, the Bank is a New York State-chartered savings bank with 237 branches that currently operates through eight local divisions, each with a history of strength and service: Queens County Savings Bank, Roslyn Savings Bank, Richmond County Savings Bank, Roosevelt Savings Bank, and Atlantic Bank in New York&#59; Garden State Community Bank in New Jersey&#59; Ohio Savings Bank in Ohio: and AmTrust Bank in Florida and Arizona. We compete for depositors in these diverse markets by emphasizing service and convenience, with a comprehensive menu of traditional and non-traditional products and services, and access to multiple service channels, including online banking, mobile banking, and banking by phone. 

We are a leading producer of multi-family loans in New York City, with an emphasis on non-luxury residential apartment buildings with rent-regulated units that feature below-market rents. In addition to multi-family loans, which are our principal asset, we originate CRE loans (primarily in New York City), specialty finance loans and leases, and, to a much lesser extent, ADC loans, and C&#38;I loans (typically made to small and mid-size business in Metro New York). 

Online Information about the Company and the Bank 

We serve our customers through our website: www.myNYCB.com. In addition to providing our customers with 24-hour access to their accounts, and information regarding our products and services, hours of service, and locations, the website provides extensive information about the Company for the investment community. Earnings releases, dividend announcements, and other press releases are posted upon issuance to the Investor Relations portion of the website. 

In addition, our filings with the SEC (including our annual report on Form 10-K&#59; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q&#59; and our current reports on Form 8-K), and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available without charge, and are posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. The website also provides information regarding our Board of Directors and management team, as well as certain Board Committee charters and our corporate governance policies. The content of our website shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 

Our Market 

Our current market for deposits consists of the 26 counties in the five states that are served by our branch network, including all five boroughs of New York City, Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, and Westchester County in New York&#59; Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union Counties in New Jersey&#59; Maricopa and Yavapai Counties in Arizona&#59; Cuyahoga, Lake, and Summit Counties in Ohio&#59; and Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and St. Lucie Counties in Florida. 

The market for the loans we produce varies, depending on the type of loan. For example, the vast majority of our multi-family loans are collateralized by rental apartment buildings in New York City, which is also home to the majority of the properties collateralizing our CRE and ADC loans. In contrast, our specialty finance loans and leases are generally made to large corporate obligors that participate in stable industries nationwide. 

&#160;

Competition for Deposits 

The combined population of the 26 counties where our branches are located is approximately 31.2 million, and the number of banks and thrifts we compete with currently exceeds 300. With total deposits of $32.4 billion at December 31, 2020, we ranked thirteenth among all bank and thrift depositories serving these 26 counties. We also ranked fourth among all banks and thrifts in Union County, New Jersey, third among all banks and thrifts in Richmond County in New York, fifth among all banks and thrifts in Queens County in New York, and second among all banks and thrifts in Nassau County in New York (market share information was provided by S&#38;P Global Market Intelligence). 

We compete for deposits and customers by placing an emphasis on convenience and service and, from time to time, by offering specific products at highly competitive rates. In addition to our 237 branches, we have 340 ATM locations, including 232 that operate 24 hours a day, and 68 that are off-site ATMs. Our customers also have 24-hour access to their accounts through our mobile banking app, online through our website, www.myNYCB.com, or through our bank-by-phone service. We also offer certain money market accounts, certificates of deposit (&#8220;CDs&#8221;), and checking accounts through a dedicated website: www.myBankingDirect.com. 

In addition to checking and savings accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts, and CDs for both businesses and consumers, we offer a suite of cash management products to address the needs of small and mid-size businesses and professional associations. We also compete by complementing our broad selection of traditional banking products with an extensive menu of alternative financial services, including annuities, life and long-term care insurance, and mutual funds of various third-party service providers. 

Our ability to attract and retain deposits is not only a function of short-term interest rates and industry consolidation, but also the competitiveness of the rates being offered by other financial institutions within our marketplace, including credit unions, on-line banks, and brokerage firms. Additionally, financial technology companies, also referred to as FinTechs, are providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong competition for deposits and customers. 

Competition for deposits is also influenced by several internal factors, including the opportunity to assume or acquire deposits through business combinations&#59; the cash flows produced through loan and securities repayments and sales&#59; and the availability of attractively priced wholesale funds. In addition, the degree to which we seek to compete for deposits is influenced by the liquidity needed to fund our loan production and other outstanding commitments. 

Another competitive advantage is our strong community presence, with April 14, 2020 having marked the 161st year of service of our forebear, Queens County Savings Bank. We have found that our longevity, as well as our strong capital position, are especially appealing to customers seeking a strong, stable, and service-oriented bank. 

Competition for Loans 

Our success as a lender is substantially tied to the economic health of the markets where we lend. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on loan demand, the value of the collateral securing our credits, and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. 

The competition we face for loans also varies with the type of loan we are originating. In New York City, where the majority of the buildings collateralizing our multi-family loans are located, we compete for such loans on the basis of timely service and the expertise that stems from being a specialist in this lending niche. In addition to the money center, regional, and local banks we compete with in this market, we compete with insurance companies and other types of lenders. Certain of the banks we compete with sell the loans they produce to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

&#160;

Our ability to compete for CRE loans depends on the same factors that impact our ability to compete for multi-family credits, and the degree to which other CRE lenders choose to offer loan products similar to ours. 

Competition for our specialty finance loans, which consist primarily of asset-based, equipment financing, and dealer floor plan loans, is driven by a variety of factors, including prevailing economic conditions and the level of interest rates. Moreover, since a majority of our customers in this category are mid-to-large size publicly traded companies, we also face competition for financing from the capital markets. In addition, the majority of specialty finance loans that we originate are sourced from larger financial institutions who have many customers for these loans. Some of these customers are larger and have more capital and liquidity than the Company. 

While we continue to originate ADC and C&#38;I loans for investment, such loans represent a small portion of our loan portfolio as compared to multi-family, CRE loans, and specialty finance loans. 

Environmental Issues 

We encounter certain environmental risks in our lending activities and other operations. The existence of hazardous materials may make it unattractive for a lender to foreclose on the properties securing its loans. In addition, under certain conditions, lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on such properties. We attempt to mitigate such environmental risks by requiring either that a borrower purchase environmental insurance or that an appropriate environmental site assessment be completed as part of our underwriting review on the initial granting of CRE and ADC loans, regardless of location, and of any out-of-state multi-family loans we may produce. Depending on the results of an assessment, appropriate measures are taken to address the identified risks. In addition, we order an updated environmental analysis prior to foreclosing on such properties, and typically hold foreclosed multi-family, CRE, and ADC properties in subsidiaries. 

Our attention to environmental risks also applies to the properties and facilities that house our bank operations. Prior to acquiring a large-scale property, a Phase 1 Environmental Property Assessment is typically performed by a licensed professional engineer to determine the integrity of, and/or the potential risk associated with, the facility and the property on which it is built. Properties and facilities of a smaller scale are evaluated by qualified in-house assessors, as well as by industry experts in environmental testing and remediation. This two-pronged approach identifies potential risks associated with asbestos-containing material, above and underground storage tanks, radon, electrical transformers (which may contain PCBs), ground water flow, storm and sanitary discharge, and mold, among other environmental risks. These processes assist us in mitigating environmental risk by enabling us to identify and address potential issues, including by avoiding taking ownership or control of contaminated properties.

&#160;

Human Capital 

At December 31, 2020, our workforce included 2,948 employees, including 1,635 retail employees and 1,313 back office employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations to be good.

&#160;

We believe our employees are among our most significant resources and that our employees are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of benefits, both of which we believe are competitive with our industry peers and with other firms in the locations in which we do business. Our employees receive salaries that are subject to annual review and periodic benchmarking. Our benefits program includes a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, an employee stock ownership plan, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts and paid time off. Many of our employees are also eligible to participate in the Company&#8217;s equity award program.

&#160;

We are proud to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects the demographics of the communities in which we do business. Our company recognizes that the talents of a diverse workforce are a key competitive advantage. We strive to create and foster a supportive environment for all of our employees and are proud to share our business success with individuals whose cultural and personal differences create a more innovative and productive workplace. Our workforce is 33% male and 67% female and women represent 51% of the Company&#8217;s leadership (defined to include employees at the level of vice president and above). In addition, for those employees identifying as such, approximately 48% of our workforce have diverse ethnic backgrounds. We engage in significant outreach to veterans, women and minorities in our recruiting efforts, and our policies and practices reflect our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 

&#160;

Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and all employees are required to complete annual training that focuses on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination.

&#160;

The health and safety of our employees is also of critical importance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a response plan that included the transitioning of a significant percentage of our back office workforce to a remote work model, while implementing additional safety protocols for employees who, due to the nature of their positions, continued on-site work. We took steps to ensure compliance with federal, state and local requirements that enhanced workplace safety, such as masking and social distancing, and we provided employees who either contracted or were exposed to COVID-19 with appropriate leave. 

Federal, State, and Local Taxation 

The Company is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. See the discussion of &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; in &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; later in this annual report. 

Regulation and Supervision 

General 

The Bank is a New York State-chartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured under the DIF of the FDIC up to applicable legal limits. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank was subject to regulation and supervision by the NYSDFS, as its chartering agency&#59; by the FDIC, as primary federal supervisor for all state-chartered banks and savings institutions that are not members of the Federal Reserve System and by the CFPB. 

The Bank is required to file reports with the NYSDFS, the FDIC, and the CFPB concerning its activities and financial condition, and is periodically examined by the NYSDFS, the FDIC, and the CFPB to assess compliance with various regulatory requirements, including with respect to safety and soundness and consumer 

&#160;

financial protection regulations. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for credit losses on loans and leases for regulatory purposes. Changes in such regulations or in banking legislation could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank, and their operations, as well as the Company&#8217;s shareholders. 

The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;) by the FRB. Furthermore, the Company would be required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. 

In addition, the Company is periodically examined by the FRB-NY, and is required to file certain reports under, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the SEC under federal securities laws. Certain of the regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company are referred to below or elsewhere herein. However, such discussion is not meant to be a complete explanation of all laws and regulations, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

Enacted in July 2010, the DFA significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will continue to affect, into the immediate future, the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. The DFA is complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, and represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. 

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act 

On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;) was signed into law. As enacted, EGRRCPA modified major provisions of the DFA and other laws governing regulation of the financial industry. Among other things, EGRRCPA re-defined the manner by which banks are designated as a SIFI, by increasing the asset threshold to $250 billion from $50 billion&#59; modified and provided exemptions to certain mortgage lending rules&#59; provided an exemption for certain banks with less than $10 billion in assets from leverage and risk-based capital requirements&#59; created an exemption from prohibitions on proprietary trading (the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;)&#59; and included various provisions to address consumer protection&#59; as well as several provisions regarding securities exchanges and capital formation. 

The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019

On June 14, 2019, the New York State Legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 impacting about one million rent-regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from material capital improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements&#59; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation&#59; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high income deregulation&#59; and (iv) repealed the 20% vacancy bonus. While it will take several years for its full impact to be known, the legislation generally limits a landlord&#8217;s ability to increase rents on rent-regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rent apartments.

Capital Requirements 

In early July 2013, the FRB and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and to address relevant provisions of the DFA. Basel III generally refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009. The Basel III rules generally refer to the rules adopted by U.S. banking regulators in December 2010 to align U.S. bank capital requirements with Basel III and with the related loss absorbency rules they issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. 

&#160;

The Basel III rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for the purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital in accordance with the following ratios: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%&#59; (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%)&#59; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the prior rules)&#59; and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. 

In addition, the Basel III rules assign higher risk weights to certain assets, such as the 150% risk weighting assigned to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status, and to certain CRE facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property. Basel III also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from tier 1 capital. In addition, tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are required, subject to limitation, to be deducted from capital. Finally, tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. 

Basel III also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (consisting entirely of common equity tier 1 capital) that is 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. This resulted in an increase in the minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capital ratios to 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. The phase-in of the new capital conservation buffer requirement was fully implemented in January 2019. The capital conservation buffer is now at its fully phased-in level of 2.5%. An institution can be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital levels fall below these amounts. Basel III also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such capital distributions. 

On September 17, 2019, the FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a final rule designed to reduce regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies&#8217; regulatory capital rule. Most aspects of the rule apply only to banking organizations that are not subject to the &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; in the capital rule, which are generally firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure. The rule simplifies and clarifies a number of the more complex aspects of the existing capital rule. Specifically, the rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The five capital tiers are described in more detail below. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, an institution that fails to remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth, or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervision authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. 

As a result of the Basel III rules, new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater. 

&#160;

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution&#8217;s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank&#8217;s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized&#59; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers&#59; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. 

Beginning 60 days after becoming &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status. 

As of December 31, 2020, each of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulations. 

Stress Testing 

Stress Testing for Systemically Important Financial Institutions 

Should the four-quarter average of our total consolidated assets exceed $250 billion, we would become subject to the FRB&#8217;s stress testing regulations administered under its CCAR capital planning and supervisory process. Under this regime, in addition to reporting the results of a SIFI&#8217;s own capital stress testing, the FRB uses its own models to evaluate whether each SIFI has the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to continue operating under the economic and financial market conditions of stressed macroeconomic scenarios identified by the FRB. The FRB&#8217;s analysis includes an assessment of the projected losses, net income, and pro forma capital levels, and the regulatory capital ratio, tier 1 common ratio, and other capital ratios, for the SIFI, and uses such analytical techniques that the FRB determines to be appropriate to identify, measure, and monitor any risks of the SIFI that may affect the financial stability of the United States. 

Boards of directors of SIFIs are required to review and approve capital plans before they are submitted to the FRB. 

In October 2019, the FDIC issued a final rule, which became effective on November 25, 2019, that revised the FDIC&#8217;s requirement for stress testing by FDIC-insured institutions, consistent with changes made by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The rule amended the FDIC&#8217;s existing stress testing regulations to change the minimum threshold for applicability from $10 billion to $250 billion, revised the frequency of required stress tests by FDIC-supervised institutions from annual to periodic, and reduced the number of required stress testing scenarios from three to two. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe, for the depository institutions under its jurisdiction, standards that relate to, among other things, internal controls&#59; information and audit systems&#59; loan 

&#160;

documentation&#59; credit underwriting&#59; the monitoring of interest rate risk&#59; asset growth&#59; compensation&#59; fees and benefits&#59; and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) to implement these safety and soundness standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, (the &#8220;FDI Act&#8221;). 

FDIC Regulations 

The discussion that follows pertains to FDIC regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages. 

Real Estate Lending Standards 

The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that prescribe standards for extensions of credit that (i) are secured by real estate, or (ii) are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate. The FDIC regulations require each institution to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities. The standards also must be consistent with accompanying FDIC Guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for the different types of real estate loans. Institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan-to-value limitations as long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately. The FDIC Guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan-to-value standards are justified. 

The FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB (collectively, the &#8220;Agencies&#8221;) also have issued joint guidance entitled &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices&#8221; (the &#8220;CRE Guidance&#8221;). The CRE Guidance, which addresses land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans, as well as CRE loans, does not establish specific lending limits but, rather, reinforces and enhances the Agencies&#8217; existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management. Specifically, the CRE Guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in CRE lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital&#59; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the bank&#8217;s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of CRE lending. 

On December 13, 2019, the Agencies issued a final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, to modify the agencies&#8217; capital rules for high volatility CRE (&#8220;HVCRE&#8221;) exposures, as required by the EGRRCPA. The final rule revises the definition of HVCRE exposure to make it consistent with the statutory definition of the term included in Section 214 of the EGRRCPA, which excludes any loan made before January 1, 2015. The revised HVCRE exposure definition differs from the previous definition primarily in two ways. First, the previous definition applied to loans that financed ADC activities, whereas the new definition only applies to loans that &#8220;primarily&#8221; finance ADC activities and that are secured by land or improved real estate. This change excludes multipurpose credit facilities that primarily finance the purchase of equipment or other non-ADC activities. Second, the new definition permits the full appraised value of borrower-contributed land (less the total amount of any liens on the real property securing the HVCRE exposure) to count toward the 15 percent capital contribution of the real property&#8217;s appraised &#8220;as completed&#8221; value, which is one of the criteria for an exemption from the heightened risk weight. The final rule includes a grandfathering provision, which will provide banking organizations with the option to maintain their current capital treatment for ADC loans originated on or after 

&#160;

January 1, 2015, and before April 1, 2020. Banking organizations also will have the option to reevaluate any or all of their ADC loans originated on or after January 1, 2015, using the revised HVCRE exposure definition. 

Dividend Limitations 

The FDIC has authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a savings bank or commercial bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law prohibits the payment of dividends that will result in the institution failing to meet applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. The Bank is also subject to dividend declaration restrictions imposed by, and as later discussed under, &#8220;New York State Law.&#8221; 

Investment Activities 

Since the enactment of the FDICIA, all state-chartered financial institutions, including savings banks, commercial banks, and their subsidiaries, have generally been limited to such activities as principal and equity investments of the type, and in the amount, authorized for national banks. The GLBA and FDIC regulations impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a bank&#8217;s dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities. 

In 1993, the Bank received grandfathering authority from the FDIC, which it continues to use, to invest in listed stocks and/or registered shares subject to the maximum permissible investments of 100% of tier 1 capital, as specified by the FDIC&#8217;s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by New York State Banking Law, whichever is less. Such grandfathering authority is subject to termination upon the FDIC&#8217;s determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk to the Bank, or in the event that the Bank converts its charter or undergoes a change in control. 

Enforcement 

The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders, and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF. The maximum deposit insurance provided by the FDIC per account owner is $250,000 for all types of accounts. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital level, and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments based on the assigned risk levels. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain other factors. Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of the institution&#8217;s assessment base, which is calculated as average total assets minus average tangible equity. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that would lead to termination of the deposit insurance for the Bank. 

Holding Company Regulations 

Federal Regulation 

The Company is currently subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the BHCA, as administered by the FRB. 

&#160;

The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In addition, before any bank acquisition can be completed, prior approval thereof may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired, including the NYSDFS. 

FRB regulations generally prohibit a bank holding company from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans&#59; (ii) performing certain data processing services&#59; (iii) providing discount brokerage services&#59; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment, or financial advisor&#59; (v) leasing personal or real property&#59; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare&#59; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association. 

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB&#8217;s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings, and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB&#8217;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to the bank during periods of financial stress or adversity, and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank where necessary. 

The DFA codified the source of financial strength policy and required regulations to facilitate its application. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the BHCA does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 

New York State Regulation 

The Company is subject to regulation as a &#8220;multi-bank holding company&#8221; under New York State law. Among other requirements, this means that the Company must receive the approval of the Superintendent prior to the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of another banking institution, or to otherwise acquire a banking institution by merger or purchase. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees or acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to, the institution or its subsidiaries as similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains a specific exemption for loans made by an institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with other federal banking laws. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and FRB Regulation O adopted thereunder, govern loans by a savings bank or commercial bank to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Federal Regulation 

Under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA generally does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In its most recent FDIC CRA performance evaluation, the Bank received overall state ratings of &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; for Ohio, Florida, Arizona, and New Jersey, as well as for the New York/New Jersey multi-state region. Furthermore, the most recent overall FDIC CRA ratings for the Bank was &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; 

New York State Regulation 

The Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a banking institution organized in New York State to serve the credit needs of its local community. Such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA. The latest New York State CRA rating received by the Bank was &#8220;Outstanding.&#8221;

Bank Secrecy and Anti-Money Laundering 

Federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker/dealer subsidiaries, to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to prevent, detect, and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and to verify the identity of their customers. In addition, these provisions require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules, based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with, or investment in, a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from, and exports to, a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country&#59; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Data Privacy 

Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The GLBA requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy practices and policies relating to sharing such information and enable retail customers to opt out of the Company&#8217;s ability to share certain information with 

&#160;

affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. 

Cybersecurity 

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (the &#8220;CISA&#8221;) is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. through sharing of information about security threats between the U.S. government and private sector organizations, including financial institutions such as the Company. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems, notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from potential cyber-attacks. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having those Officers certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting&#59; that they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting&#59; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB-NY capital stock. At December 31, 2020 the Bank held $714.0 million of FHLB-NY stock. 

New York State Law 

The Bank derives its lending, investment, and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the NYSDFS, as limited by FDIC regulations. Under these laws and regulations, banks, including the Bank, may invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities, and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies), certain types of corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. 

Under New York State Banking Law, New York State-chartered stock-form savings banks may declare and pay dividends out of their net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. Approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less prior dividends paid. 

New York State Banking Law gives the Superintendent authority to issue an order to a New York State-chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices, and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the NYSDFS that any director, trustee, or officer of any banking organization has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee, or officer may be removed from office after notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Superintendent also has authority to appoint a conservator or a receiver for a savings or commercial bank under certain circumstances. 

&#160;

Interstate Branching 

Federal law allows the FDIC, and New York State Banking Law allows the Superintendent, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches by merger, unless, in the case of the FDIC, the state of the target institution has opted out of interstate branching. New York State Banking Law authorizes savings banks and commercial banks to open and occupy de novo branches outside the state of New York. Pursuant to the DFA, the FDIC is authorized to approve a state bank&#8217;s establishment of a de novo interstate branch if the intended host state allows de novo branching by banks chartered by that state. The Bank currently maintains 40 branches in New Jersey, 26 branches in Florida, 28 branches in Ohio, and 14 branches in Arizona, in addition to its 129 branches in New York State. 

Acquisition of the Holding Company 

Federal Restrictions 

Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CIBCA&#8221;), a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Under the CIBCA, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer&#59; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Company, the Bank&#59; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain &#8220;control&#8221; of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company, the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company&#8217;s directors, or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company. Under the BHCA, an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the FRB&#8217;s approval before acquiring more than 5% of the Company&#8217;s voting stock. See &#8220;Holding Company Regulation&#8221; earlier in this report. 

New York State Change in Control Restrictions 

New York State Banking Law generally requires prior approval of the New York State Banking Board before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution which is organized in New York. 

Federal Securities Law 

The Company&#8217;s common stock and certain other securities listed on the cover page of this report are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company is subject to the information and proxy solicitation requirements, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

Consumer Protection Regulations 

The activities of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiary, including its lending and deposit gathering activities, is subject to a variety of consumer laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions, and reputational damage to the financial institution. 

Applicable consumer protection laws include, but may not be limited to, the DFA, Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Expedited Funds Availability (Regulation CC), Reserve Requirements (Regulation D), Insider Transactions (Regulation O), Privacy of Consumer Information (Regulation P), Margin Stock Loans (Regulation U), Right To Financial Privacy Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Service members Civil Relief Act, 

&#160;

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Homeownership Counseling Act. 

In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Bank is subject to oversight by the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was established under the DFA to implement and enforce rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit acts and practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#8217;s interests. 

The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings, and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB also may institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as certain of their affiliates. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s Boards of Directors are actively engaged in the process of overseeing the efforts made by the Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) department to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, and report risk. The Company has established an ERM program that reinforces a strong risk culture to support sound risk management practices. The Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of the ERM program and framework. 

ERM is responsible for setting and aligning the Company&#8217;s Risk Appetite Policy with the goals and objectives set forth in the budget, and the strategic and capital plans. Internal controls and ongoing monitoring processes capture and address heightened risks that threaten the Company&#8217;s ability to achieve our goals and objectives, including the recognition of safety and soundness concerns and consumer protection. Additionally, ERM monitors key risk indicators against the established risk warning levels and limits, as well as elevated risks identified by the Chief Risk Officer. 

&#160;

Current Operating Environment 

COVID-19 Pandemic

The most significant factor impacting the Company&#8217;s current operating environment has been the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning with the first occurrence of the virus in the United States in 2020, it spread quickly throughout the country during the first quarter. Due to its high rate of contagion and mortality, state and local governments enacted numerous safeguards to contain the spread of the virus. These included the shut-down of all businesses considered to be &#8220;non-essential,&#8221; restrictions on gatherings, social distancing requirements being put in place, and numerous other restrictions that have impacted daily behavior. In our market area, the governor of New York issued orders that, among other things, required residents to stay in their homes and permitted them to leave only to conduct certain essential business activities or to travel to work, and closed all non-essential businesses to the general public. These stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions have resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, and mass layoffs and furloughs. Capacity restrictions on movement and health and safety recommendations that encourage continued 

&#160;

physical distancing and working remotely have limited the ability of businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. 

In addition, due to the concentration and severity of COVID-19 infection in the New York City metro region, was initially considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the country. This region is the Company&#8217;s largest service area, having over 100 branches and 73% of the loan portfolio. 

The Company was proactive during the very early stages of the pandemic. As an essential business, the Company implemented business continuity plans and continued to provide its financial services to customers, while taking health and safety measures into account. 

By mid-March, close to 100% of our back office employees were working remotely. In addition, at that time, we temporarily closed all 18 of our in-store branches, along with several other locations, converted some branches to drive-up only, adjusted the hours at our remaining locations, and instituted a banking by appointment program. Currently, 15 of our 18 in-store branches and 37 of our 219 traditional branches remain closed, with no adverse impact on our customer base or deposit trends. 

On the consumer side, we enhanced our online banking and mobile app capabilities, temporarily waived certain retail banking fees for those customers experiencing financial difficulties, and offered 90 day payment forbearances to residential mortgage customers. We also put in place several risk mitigation strategies, including enhanced monitoring of certain credits. On the commercial side, we instituted a six-month deferral program for those borrowers experiencing hardships, in line with regulatory guidance. Additionally, under the CARES Act, we provided some of our borrowers with small business loans under the Payment Protection Program.

In addition, extensive precautions were taken to protect employees returning to their offices and in their branches. As of this writing, 25% of back-office employees are back in their offices and a majority of our branches have reopened. We also provide daily communications via email to all of our employees to ensure that they have ongoing access to critical information and have set up a 24-hour help line for employees and their family members to speak with qualified clinicians. 

In response to the pandemic and to ensure that the Company&#8217;s operations during the term of the pandemic, run smoothly, senior management formed two committees: the COVID-19 Resiliency Committee and the COVID-19 Lending Committee. The COVID-19 Resiliency Committee meets daily and is primarily focused on operational issues including employee safety and well-being, branch closings, PPE procurement, IT sustainability, and continuous monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 Lending Committee meets weekly and focuses on our credit quality trends and our loan deferral program.
