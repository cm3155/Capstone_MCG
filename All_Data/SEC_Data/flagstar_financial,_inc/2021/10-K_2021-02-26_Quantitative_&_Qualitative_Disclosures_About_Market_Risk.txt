 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The asset and liability management process has three primary objectives: to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts&#59; to determine the appropriate level of risk, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives&#59; and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Market Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility, which represents our primary market risk. Changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Board of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may, in turn, be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated&#59; seasonal factors&#59; demographic variables&#59; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

In 2020, we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: (1) We have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans&#59; (2) We have continued the origination of certain C&#38;I loans that feature floating interest rates&#59; (3) We replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings&#59; and (4) In 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $2.0 billion to hedge certain real estate loans. 

LIBOR Transition Process 

On July 27, 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 which was recently extended to June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the FRB has recommended an alternative index dubbed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or &#8220;SOFR&#8221;. The Bank has established a sub-committee of its ALCO to address issues related to the phase-out and ultimate transition away from LIBOR to an alternate rate. This sub-committee is led by our Chief Financial Officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the Bank including lending, loan administration, credit risk management, finance/treasury, information technology, and operations. The Company has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond 2021 included in loans and leases, securities, wholesale borrowings, derivative financial instruments, and long-term debt. The sub-committee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines. To mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company has ceased originating LIBOR-linked residential mortgage loans, implemented fallback language for LIBOR-linked commercial loans, adhered to the ISDA 2020 Fallbacks Protocol for interest rate swap agreements, and has updated or is in the process of updating its systems to accommodate SOFR-linked loans. In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company intends to stop entering into LIBOR transactions by the end of 2021.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are &#8220;interest rate sensitive&#8221; and by monitoring a bank&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity &#8220;gap.&#8221; An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time. 

&#160;

At December 31, 20 20 , our one-year gap was a negative 4.94 %, as compared to a negative 12 . 31 % at December 31, 201 9 . The change in our one-year gap from December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an increase in c ash and cash equivalents and the addition of more term funding. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. 

The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2020 which, based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience, are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of (1) the term to repricing, or (2) the contractual terms of the asset or liability. 

The table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. For residential mortgage-related securities, prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average CPR of 25.83% per annum&#59; for multi-family and CRE loans, prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average CPRs of 17.12% and 12.08% per annum, respectively. Borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay. 

Savings, interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience. Based on the results of this analysis, savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 75% for the first five years and 25% for years six through ten. Interest-bearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 83% for the first five years and 17% for years six through ten. The decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior. Including those accounts having specified repricing dates, money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 91% for the first five years and 9% for years six through ten.

Prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap. While we believe our assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates noted above will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity. 

To validate our prepayment assumptions for our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, we perform a monthly analysis, during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates. We continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible, since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on one-to-four family loans tend to be. In addition, we review the call provisions in our borrowings and investment portfolios and, on a monthly basis, compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable. 

As of December 31, 2020, the impact of a 100 bp decline in market interest rates for our loans would have had very little impact on prepayment speeds due to the current low interest rates and current coupons being floored at base rates. The impact of a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multi-family and CRE loans by a constant prepayment rate of 2.92% per annum 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Also, the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates. 

Interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates, and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at December 31, 2020, the following table sets forth our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

As with the Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires that certain assumptions be made which 

&#160;

may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Accordingly, while the EVE analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

We also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk. The simulation incorporates various market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates&#59; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories&#59; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. Based on the information and assumptions in effect at December 31, 2020, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged. 

##TABLE_END

The impact of a 100bp and a 200-bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

##TABLE_END

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap, NPV, and/or net interest income simulation. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

##TABLE_END

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities&#59; and/or 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At December 31, 2020 , our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 6.57 % decrease in net interest income&#59; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 1.74 % increase in net interest income. It should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated, given the changing market rate environment, which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity.
