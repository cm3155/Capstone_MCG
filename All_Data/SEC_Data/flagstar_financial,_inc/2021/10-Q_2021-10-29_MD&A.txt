&#160; 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING LANGUAGE 

This report, like many written and oral communications presented by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. 

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of the words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;strive,&#8221; &#8220;try,&#8221; or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; or similar expressions. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations as reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will be achieved or realized. 

Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans and strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

In addition, the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control. 

Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, we evaluate opportunities to expand through mergers and acquisitions and opportunities for strategic combinations with other banking organizations. Our evaluation of such opportunities involves discussions with other parties, 

&#160; 

due diligence, and negotiations. As a result, we may decide to enter into definitive arrangements regarding such opportunities at any time.

RECONCILIATIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, 

AND TANGIBLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY; 

TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

(unaudited) 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons: 

1. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. 

2. Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. 

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity; our total assets and tangible assets; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net income available to common shareholders was $421 million, up 42% compared to the $296 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 are $16 million in merger-related expenses and a $2 million valuation adjustment related to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the New York State corporate tax rate. 

The key trends in the third quarter of 2021 were: 

Continued Growth in Net Interest Income and NIM Expansion 

Net interest income and the NIM both continue to improve during the current quarter on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 increased $36 million or 13% to $318 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The improvement continues to be driven by lower interest expense. Interest expense fell $39 million or 29% to $97 million during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. 

Included in net interest income is prepayment income of $16 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $12 million for the third quarter of 2020. 

The Company's NIM also increased compared to the third quarter of last year. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the NIM increased 15 bp to 2.44% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020. The improvement was driven by a lower cost of funding. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the cost of funds declined 39 bp to 0.87% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020. This was due to a 50 bp decrease in the average cost of deposits to 0.35% compared to the year-ago. 

Prepayment income contributed 12 bps to this quarter's NIM compared to nine bp in the year-ago quarter. 

Strong Year-over-Year Deposit Growth 

At September 30, 2021, total deposits were $34.6 billion, up $2.9 billion or 9% compared to September 30, 2020. On a year-over-year basis, all core deposit (total deposits excluding CDs) categories increased, while the balance of CDs declined. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion or 60% to $4.9 billion on a year-over-year basis; savings accounts increased $2.0 billion or 

&#160; 

34% to $8.0 billion; and interest-bearing checking and money market accounts rose $1.3 billion or 11%. At the same time, CDs declined $2.3 billion or 21% to $8.7 billion, and now represent 25% of total deposits compared to 35% in the third quarter of last year. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On October 26, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on November 16, 2021 to common shareholders of record as of November 6, 2021. 

Pending Acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. 

On April 26, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) under which we would acquire Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (&#34;Flagstar&#34;) in a 100% stock transaction valued at the time at $2.6 billion (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Under terms of the Merger Agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Flagstar shareholders will receive 4.0151 shares of New York Community common stock for each Flagstar share they own. Following completion of the Merger, New York Community shareholders are expected to own 68% of the combined company, while Flagstar shareholders are expected to own 32% of the combined company. Currently, it does not appear that regulatory approval will be received in time to close the merger during the fourth quarter of 2021, as previously anticipated. We now estimate an anticipated closing as soon in 2022 as we can obtain regulatory approvals. 

The new company will have over $85 billion in total assets, operate nearly 400 traditional branches in nine states, and retail home lending offices across a 28-state footprint. It will have its headquarters on Long Island, N.Y. with regional headquarters in Troy, Michigan, including Flagstar's mortgage operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used therein, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies: the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases; and the determination of the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. 

The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The Company&#8217;s January 1, 2020, adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since December 31, 2019. ASU No. 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under ASC Topic 842. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the Company expects to collect. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, fair value hedge accounting adjustments, and deferred fees and costs. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Management estimates the allowance by projecting probability-of-default, loss-given-default and exposure-at-default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term. Economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and economic forecasts. The Company&#8217;s economic forecast period reverts to a historical norm based on inputs after 24 months. Historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, with adjustments made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels and terms, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in legislation, regulation, policies, administrative practices or other relevant factors. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals. The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit 

&#160; 

quality and forecasted economic conditions. Each quarter, we reassess the appropriateness of the economic period, the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level, considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and other relevant data shifts over time. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Management believes the products within each of the entity&#8217;s portfolio classes exhibit similar risk characteristics. Loans that are determined to have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis by management. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient, expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, less costs to sell as appropriate. The macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on an economic forecast period of 24 months. The Company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast. Beyond this forecast period, we revert to a historical average loss rate. This reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 

The portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses. Smaller pools of homogeneous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment to which factors in the qualitative scorecard include: concentration, modeling and forecast imprecision and limitations, policy and underwriting, prepayment uncertainty, external factors, nature and volume, management, and loan review. Each factor is subject to an evaluation of metrics, consistently applied, to measure adjustments needed for each reporting period. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as TDR or &#8220;reasonably expected TDR&#8221; (criticized, classified, or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months). In addition, all taxi medallion loans are individually evaluated. 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was $12 million. We estimate expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life. The Company examined historical credit conversion factor (&#8220;CCF&#8221;) trends to estimate utilization rates, and chose an appropriate mean CCF based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis involved examination of CCFs over a range of fund-up windows (between 12 and 36 months) and comparison of the mean CCF for each fund-up window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean CCF across fund-up windows made business sense. The Company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on loan and leases increased primarily as a result of growth across segments of the loan portfolio, and by macroeconomic factors surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the resultant estimated decreases in property values in the New York City area. The macroeconomic forecast includes Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) to rise at an annualized rate of 5.0% for 2021 as the economy begins to recover from the systemic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment continues to subside from the historic shock of 2020, but is not forecasted to return to pre-pandemic levels around 3.5% until 2023. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is expected to steadily increase over the next few years. Baa Corp-10 Year treasury spread widens slightly beginning in 2022 and levels off at 2.6% through 2023. In addition to these quantitative inputs, several qualitative factors were considered in increasing our allowance for loan and lease credit losses, including the risk that the economic decline proves to be more severe and/or prolonged than our baseline forecast. The impact of the unprecedented fiscal stimulus and changes to federal and local laws and regulations, including changes to various government sponsored loan programs, was also considered. 

Current Expected Credit Losses 

At December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $148 million. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the CECL methodology under ASU Topic 326. Upon adoption, we recognized an increase in the ACL of $2 million as a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment from changes in methodology, with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings. At September 30, 2021, the ACL totaled $200 million, up $6 million compared to December 31, 2020 driven by net recoveries of $7 million during the first nine months of 2021 and a $1 million recovery of credit losses. 

&#160; 

Separately, at December 31, 2019, the Company had an allowance for unfunded commitments of $461,000. With the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we recognized a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment of $13 million. At September 30, 2021, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $12 million.

Goodwill Impairment 

The Company adopted, on a prospective basis, ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment on January 1, 2020. We have significant intangible assets as of September 30, 2021, including goodwill of $2.4 billion. In connection with our acquisitions, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. We have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment and reportable segment. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to the recorded goodwill balance. 

We perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more often if events or circumstances warrant. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we would compare the fair value the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. The loss recognized, however, would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, we would consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. 

The Company assessed the environment in the third quarter of 2021, including the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic variables and economic forecasts and how those might impact the fair value of our reporting unit. After consideration of the items above and the first nine months of 2021 results, the Company determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below book value as of September 30, 2021. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and its impact on our market capitalization, overall economic conditions, and any triggering events that may indicate an impairment of goodwill in the future. 

Balance Sheet Summary 

At September 30, 2021, total assets were $57.9 billion, up $3.0 billion or 5% compared to September 30, 2020. The growth was led by increases in cash balances, securities, and to a lesser extent loans, along with growth in deposits. 

Cash balances increased $1.1 billion or 73% to $2.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Total securities increased $649 million or 12% over the same time frame due to excess liquidity. 

Total loans and leases held for investment rose $858 million or 2% to $43.7 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020 with most of this growth coming from the multi-family segment. On a year-over-year basis, multi-family loans increased $738 million or 2% to $32.9 billion. The specialty finance portfolio also increased, rising $115 million or 4% to $3.2 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. C&#38;I loans rose $166 million or 42% to $560 million, while the CRE portfolio declined $170 million or 2% to $6.7 billion. 

At September 30, 2021, our deposits totaled $34.6 billion, up $2.9 billion or 9% compared to September 30, 2020. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the launch of two initiatives earlier this year: our Banking as a Service business and our strategy to bring in more deposits from our borrowers. Banking as a Service deposits totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2021, the majority of which are in the non-interest bearing category, while loan-related deposits were $4.2 billion, up $652 million since the beginning of the year. Non-interest bearing deposits totaled $4.9 billion at September 30, 2021, up $1.8 billion or 60% on a year-over-year basis. Savings accounts also increased, growing by $2.0 billion or 34% to $8.0 billion year-over-year and interest-bearing checking and money market accounts rose $1.3 billion or 11% to $13.0 billion compared to the third quarter of last year. At the same 

&#160; 

time, CDs continue to decline. CDs totaled $8.7 billion at September 30, 2021, down $2.3 billion or 21% from September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2021, CDs represented 25% of total deposits compared to 35% at September 30, 2020. 

Total borrowed funds at September 30, 2021 were $15.4 billion, down $249 million or 2% compared to September 30, 2020. All of the decline was in the wholesale borrowings category, which consists entirely of FHLB-NY borrowings. 

Total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2021 was $7.0 billion, up $232 million or 3% compared to September 30, 2020. Excluding goodwill and preferred stock, tangible common stockholders' equity at September 30, 2021 totaled $4.0 billion, up $232 million or 6% compared to September 30, 2020. Book value per common share was $13.90 at September 30, 2021 compared to $13.43 at September 30, 2020, while tangible book value per share was $8.68 at September 30, 2021 compared to $8.20 at September 30, 2020. 

Common stockholders' equity to total assets was 11.17% at September 30, 2021 compared to 11.34% at September 30, 2020. On a tangible basis, tangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets was 7.28% at September 30, 2021 compared to 7.25% at September 30, 2020. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and Leases Originated for Investment 

The majority of the loans we originate are loans and leases held for investment and most of the held-for-investment loans we produce are multi-family loans. Our production of multi-family loans began over five decades ago in the five boroughs of New York City, where the majority of the rental units currently consist of non-luxury, rent-regulated apartments featuring below-market rents. In addition to multi-family loans, our portfolio of loans held for investment contains a number of CRE loans, most of which are secured by income-producing properties located in New York City and Long Island. 

In addition to multi-family and CRE loans, our specialty finance loans and leases have become an increasingly larger portion of our overall loan portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio includes smaller balances of C&#38;I loans, one-to-four family loans, ADC loans, and other loans held for investment. The majority of C&#38;I loans consist of loans to small- and mid-size businesses. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company originated $3.0 billion of loans and leases held for investment, relatively unchanged compared to the year-ago third quarter. Third-quarter 2021 originations exceeded the second quarter pipeline by $1.6 billion. Mortgage loans originated for investment declined 12% to $2.0 billion compared to the year-ago third quarter, partially offset by a 35% increase in other loans originated for investment to $925 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, total loans originated for investment declined 5% to $8.6 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Total mortgage loans originated for investment declined 4% to $6.2 billion, while other loans originated for investment declined 8% to $2.3 billion.

Loans and Leases Held for Investment 

The individual held-for-investment loan portfolios are discussed in detail below. 

Multi-Family Loans 

Multi-family loans are our principal asset. The loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury residential apartment buildings in New York City that are rent-regulated and feature below-market rents&#8212;a market we refer to as our &#8220;Primary Lending Niche.&#8221; The majority of our multi-family loans are made to long-term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to rent regulation and feature below-market rents. 

At September 30, 2021, total multi-family loans represented $32.9 billion or 75% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

At September 30, 2021, 77% of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings in the New York City metro area and 3.1% were secured by buildings elsewhere in New York State. The remaining multi-family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets, including in the four other states we operate in. 

In addition, 67% or $22.0 billion of the Company's overall multi-family portfolio is secured by properties in New York State, of which $19.2 billion are subject to rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the rent-regulated segment of the multi-family portfolio was 55.23%, as of September 30, 2021, 327 bps below the overall multi-family weighted average LTV of 58.50%. 

Our emphasis on multi-family loans is driven by several factors, including their structure, which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree. Another factor driving our focus on multi-family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce. Reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing status have actually resulted in losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn. 

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. The sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market, as well as general economic conditions, and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 125% on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75% of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, some of our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

At September 30, 2021, CRE loans represented $6.7 billion or 15% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

The CRE loans originated by the Company are also secured by income-producing properties, such as office buildings, mixed-use buildings (retail storefront on the ground floor and apartment units above the ground floor), retail centers, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At September 30, 2021, 84% of our CRE loans were secured by properties in the New York City metro area, while properties in other parts of New York State accounted for 2.4% of the properties securing our CRE loans and properties in all other states accounted for 14% combined. 

Specialty Finance Loans and Leases 

At September 30, 2021, specialty finance loans and leases totaled $3.2 billion or 7% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

&#160; 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable lease. Asset-based and dealer floor-plan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to LIBOR, while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over Treasuries. 

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

C&#38;I Loans 

At September 30, 2021, C&#38;I loans totaled $561 million or 1.3% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

The C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses in the five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 

A broad range of C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

The interest rates on our other C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on other C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

ADC loans at September 30, 2021 totaled $198 million and represented 0.45% of total loans and leases held for investment. Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the business cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At September 30, 2021, one-to-four family loans totaled $170 million or 0.39% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

Other Loans 

Other loans totaled $6 million at September 30, 2021 and consisted mainly of overdraft loans and loans to non-profit organizations. We currently do not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit. 

Lending Authority 

The loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies approved by the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $3 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $3 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and Specialty Finance loans regardless of amount are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, and C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and Specialty Finance in excess of $15 million are also required to be presented to the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee of the Board, as applicable so that the Committees can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks. The Commercial Credit and Mortgage and Real Estate Committees have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

&#160; 

All mortgage loans in excess of $50 million, specialty finance loans in excess of $15 million and all other C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million require approval by the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee or the Credit Committee of the Board, as applicable. 

The Board of Directors updated certain aspects of the Company's lending authority as detailed below. These changes were effective as of July 21, 2021. 

Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans less than or equal to $10 million and C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $5 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $10 million are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $50 million and C&#38;I loans in excess of $10 million are also required to be presented to the Board Credit Committee of the Board, so that the Committee can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks and approve the credit. The Board Credit Committee has authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

In addition, all loans of $50 million or more originated by the Bank continue to be reported to the Board of Directors. 

At September 30, 2021, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $329 million multi-family loan collateralized by six properties located in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination.

&#160; 

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recorded when received in cash. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all of our non-performing loans were non-accrual loans. 

&#160; 

We monitor non-accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area, which is defined as including: (a) the counties that comprise our CRA Assessment area, and (b) the entirety of the following states: Arizona; Florida; New York; New Jersey; Ohio; and Pennsylvania, in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising the collateral properties; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and/or retained legal counsel, as applicable; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance; monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed; and appointing a receiver, whenever possible, to collect rents, manage the operations, provide information, and maintain the collateral properties. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing loans, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, in the event that such a loan is 90 days or more past due, and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is generally not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. We do not analyze LTVs on a portfolio-wide basis. 

Non-performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank, as applicable. Collateral-dependent non-performing loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers. 

Properties and assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as either OREO or repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property/asset. Subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO or repossessed assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment (in accordance with our Environmental Risk Policy) of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise the properties/assets on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties/assets as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s or asset&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to closing, with a member of the Board Credit Committee participating in inspections on multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans to be originated in excess of $50 million. We continue to conduct inspections as per the aforementioned policy, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently full access to some properties and buildings may be limited. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. In many cases, a second independent appraisal review is performed. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain new rent regulation laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time. While our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

&#160; 

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 125% for multi-family loans and 130% for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75% of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65% on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at September 30, 2021. Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130% and a maximum LTV of 65%. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. Furthermore, in the case of multi-family loans, the cash flows generated by the properties are generally below-market and have significant value. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75% of the estimated as-completed market value of multi-family and residential tract projects; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80%. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65% of the estimated as-completed market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation. 

Other C&#38;I loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower&#8217;s business, and are generally collateralized by various business assets, including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable. As a result, the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful. Furthermore, the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, and may fluctuate in value, based upon the operating results of the business. Accordingly, personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other C&#38;I loans. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings.

(1) Does not include any past due taxi medallion-related loans at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

During the third quarter of 2021, total loans 30-89 days past due increased to $447 million compared to $16 million at December 31, 2020. Approximately $377 million of the third-quarter 2021 amount is related to multiple loans to one borrower and consists primarily of multi-family and mixed-use properties, all of which are in the 30 days past due category. All of the properties are located in Manhattan and approximately 72% of the units feature market rents. Certain of the buildings include units used for student housing. The $377 million is comprised of 55 separate loans with an average balance of less than $7 million per loan. The Company is working with the borrower, who has entered into a CARES Act-related deferral agreement for the loans in question. The loans have a 57% LTV based on original appraised values. The Bank is well-secured on these properties and does not expect to incur losses on this relationship. 

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing or as an accruing TDR, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can adversely impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. 

Based upon all relevant and available information as of the end of the current second quarter, management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date. 

At September 30, 2021, the Company's three largest NPLs were three CRE loans with balances of $8 million, $7 million and $3 million. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, we have selectively extended to certain borrowers such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates, as well as forbearance agreements, when such borrowers have exhibited financial difficulty. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. 

The eligibility of a borrower for work-out concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction, which may change from period to period, and involve management&#8217;s judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the Company. 

Loans modified as TDRs are placed on non-accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. This generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. At September 30, 2021, non-accrual TDRs included taxi medallion-related loans with a combined balance of $7 million. 

At September 30, 2021, loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extensions of maturity dates totaled $33 million. 

Based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms, our success rates for restructured CRE loans, was 100%. The success rates for restructured one-to-four family and other loans were 0% and 18%, respectively, at September 30, 2021.

On a limited basis, we may provide additional credit to a borrower after a loan has been placed on non-accrual status or classified as a TDR if, in management&#8217;s judgment, the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, no such additions were made. Furthermore, the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of non-payment of a restructured loan. 

Except for the non-accrual loans and TDRs disclosed in this filing, we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case. 

Loan Deferrals 

Under U.S. GAAP, banks are required to assess modifications to a loan&#8217;s terms for potential classification as a TDR. A loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider, such as a payment deferral or interest concession. In order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers, the CARES Act and bank regulators have provided relief from TDR accounting. The main benefits of TDR relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced risk-weighted assets, as TDRs are more heavily risk-weighted for capital purposes; aging of the loans is frozen, i.e., they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification; and the loans are generally not reported as non-accrual during the modification period. 

Under the CARES Act, the Company made the election to deem that loan modifications do not result in TDRs if they are (1) related to the novel coronavirus disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;); (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the COVID-19 national emergency declaration or (B) December 31, 2020. In December 2020, Congress amended the CARES Act through the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2021, which provided additional COVID-19 relief to American families and businesses, including extending TDR relief under the CARES Act until the earlier of December 31, 2021 or 60 days following the termination of the national emergency. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers, in accordance with the CARES Act and interagency regulatory guidance. These modifications were primarily full payment deferrals for an initial six month period, with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period, at the Bank&#8217;s discretion. Most of these deferrals were entered into during April and May, and were therefore, they were eligible to come off of their deferral period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the remaining were eligible to come off their deferral during the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, at September 30, 2021, 100% of the Company's full-payment deferrals had returned to payment status. 

In addition, to the full-payment deferrals, the Company entered into certain modifications whereby the borrowers are paying interest and escrow only. At September 30, 2021, these principal deferrals totaled $914 million, down 9% or $91 million compared to $1.0 billion in the previous quarter. 

The following tables reflect, as of September 30, 2021, the aggregate amount of principal deferrals by various category.

Securities 

At September 30, 2021, total securities decreased $179 million or 12% annualized on a linked-quarter basis to $5.9 billion, compared to $6.1 billion at June 30, 2021. At the end of the current third quarter, total securities represented 10.2% of total assets compared to 10.6% at the second quarter of 2021. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock, and to the extent FHLB borrowings are utilized, may further invest in FHLB stock. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bank held FHLB-NY stock in the amount of $684 million and $714 million, respectively. FHLB-NY stock continued to be valued at par, with no impairment required at that date. 

Dividends from the FHLB-NY to the Bank totaled $8 million and $9 million, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in Non-Interest Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, our investment in BOLI increased $14 million to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020. 

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our Consolidated Statements of Condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For more information about the Company&#8217;s goodwill, see the discussion of &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; earlier in this report. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company (i.e., the Company on an unconsolidated basis) has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Company by the Bank; capital raised through the issuance of stock; and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Loan repayments and sales totaled $7.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, down $824 million from the $8.1 billion recorded in the year-earlier nine months. Cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, in the corresponding periods, while purchases of securities totaled $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. 

&#160; 

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. From time to time, we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits, depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

At September 30, 2021, total deposits were $34.6 billion, up $2.2 billion compared to December 31, 2020. At the end of the current third quarter, total deposits represented 59.8% of total assets, while CDs represented 25.2% of total deposits. The majority, or $1.8 billion of this growth occurred in the non-interest-bearing checking category, as the Company is currently working with its technology partner to bring in additional low cost deposits. These deposits are short-term in nature and related to individual spending patterns. These deposits peaked during the second quarter of 2021 and are expected to run off over the next year. 

Included in the September 30, 2021 balance of deposits were business institutional deposits of $1.5 billion and municipal deposits of $801 million, as compared to $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Brokered deposits remained stable at $5.6 billion, including brokered interest bearing checking accounts of $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, brokered money market accounts of $2.8 billion at September 30, 2021 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and brokered CDs of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2021 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors, including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources, and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds. 

Borrowed Funds 

Borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings (i.e., FHLB-NY advances, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased) and, to a far lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. As of September 30, 2021, borrowed funds declined $650 million or 5% annualized to $15.4 billion compared to December 31, 2020, and represented 26.7% of total assets at that date. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wholesale borrowings, consisting primarily of FHLB-NY advances, which declined to $14.8 billion compared to $15.4 billion at year-end 2020. Also included in wholesale borrowings are repurchase agreements of $800 million, unchanged from the balance at December 31, 2020. 

Subordinated Notes 

On November 6, 2018, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2028. The Company has used $278 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program, and may use the balance of the offering towards the repurchase of its common stock or for other general corporate purposes. The Notes were offered to the public at 100% of their face amount. At September 30, 2021, the balance of subordinated notes was $296 million, which excludes certain costs related to their issuance. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $360 million at September 30, 2021, comparable to the balance at December 31, 2020. 

Risk Definitions 

The following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, and how the Company manages market and interest rate risk: 

Interest Rate Risk &#8211; Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting Company activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in a bank&#8217;s products (options risk). The evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex, illiquid hedging strategies or products, and also the potential impact on fee income (e.g. prepayment income) which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. In those situations where trading is separately managed, this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios. 

Market Risk &#8211; Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodities markets. Many banks use the term &#8220;price risk&#8221; interchangeably with market risk; this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, and volatilities) that affect the value of traded instruments. The 

&#160; 

primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation (e.g., trading accounts for securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange products). 

Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a bank&#8217;s inability to meet its obligations when they become due, without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk also arises from a bank&#8217;s failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. 

Management of Market and Interest Rate Risk 

We manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The asset and liability management process has three primary objectives: to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; to determine the appropriate level of risk, given our business strategy, risk appetite, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives; and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Market and Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Boards of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

We manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: continue to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans; continue to originate certain floating rate C&#38;I loans; depending on funding needs, replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings; and as needed, execute interest rate swaps. 

LIBOR Transition and Phase-Out 

On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer request banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration (&#8220;IBA&#8221;) announced they will extend the publication of most US Dollar LIBOR (&#8220;USD LIBOR&#8221;) through June 30, 2023. The FRB established the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;), comprised of a group of private market participants and other members, representing banks and financial sector regulators, to identify a set of alternative reference rates for potential use as benchmarks. The FRB-NY has established the Secured Oversight Finance Rate or &#34;SOFR&#34; as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out by the end of 2021. In addition to SOFR, the Company is evaluating alternatives other than SOFR as a potential alternative to LIBOR. 

The Bank has established a sub-committee of its ALCO to address issues related to the phase-out and transition away from LIBOR. This sub-committee is led by our Chief Financial Officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the Bank including lending, loan administration, credit risk management, finance/treasury, including interest rate risk and liquidity management, information technology, and operations. 

The Company has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023 included in loans and leases, securities, wholesale borrowings, derivative financial instruments and long-term debt. The sub-committee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines. In complying with industry requirements, the Bank will not offer new LIBOR based production after December 31, 2021. 

&#160; 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are &#8220;interest rate sensitive&#8221; and by monitoring a bank&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity &#8220;gap.&#8221; An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. 

At September 30, 2021, our one-year gap was a negative 6.14%, compared to a negative 4.94% at December 31, 2020. The change in our one-year gap from December 31, 2020, primarily reflects a decrease in mortgage and other loans expected to mature or reprice within one year. 

The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2021 which, based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience, are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of (1) the term to repricing, or (2) the contractual terms of the asset or liability. 

The table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2021 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. For residential mortgage-related securities, prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average CPR of 18.52% per annum; for multi-family and CRE loans, prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average CPRs of 16.14% and 12.98% per annum, respectively. Borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay. 

&#160; 

Savings, interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience. Based on the results of this analysis, savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 77% for the first five years and 23% for years six through ten. Interest-bearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 81% for the first five years and 19% for years six through ten. The decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior. Including those accounts having specified repricing dates, money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 91% for the first five years and 9% for years six through ten.

(4) The interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap. While we believe our assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity. 

To validate our prepayment assumptions for our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, we perform a quarterly analysis, during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates. We continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible, since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on one-to-four family loans tend to be. In addition, we review the call provisions, if any, in our borrowings and investment portfolios and, on a monthly basis, compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable. 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2021, the impact of a 100 bp decline in market interest rates for our loans would have had very little impact on prepayment speeds due to the current low interest rates and current coupons being floored at base rates. The impact of a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multi-family and CRE loans by a constant prepayment rate of 3.61% per annum. 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Also, the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates. 

Interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates, and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2021, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

&#160; 

(1) The impact of a 100 bp and a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

As with the Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE Analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Accordingly, while the EVE Analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

We also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk. The simulation incorporates various market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

&#160; 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2021, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged. 

(2) The impact of a 100 bp and a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap, NPV, and/or net interest income simulation. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

&#61623; Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

&#61623; In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#61623; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#61623; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#61623; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#61623; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At September 30, 2021, our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 7.37% decrease in net interest income; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 0.73% increase in net interest income. It should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated, given the changing market rate environment, which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity. 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As in the past, our portfolios of loans and securities provided liquidity in the first nine months of the year, with 

&#160; 

cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling $7.2 billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling $1.4 billion. 

Additional liquidity stems from the retail, institutional, and municipal deposits we gather and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings. We also have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY. The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the available amount of mortgage loan collateral under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the available amount of securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At September 30, 2021, our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY was $8.3 billion. In addition, the Company had $5.9 billion of available-for-sale securities, at that date, of which $4.7 billion was unencumbered. 

Furthermore, the Bank has an agreement with the FRB-NY that enables it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing liquidity if need be. In connection with the agreement, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds that may be borrowed. At September 30, 2021, the maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY was $1.1 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding at that date. 

Our primary investing activity is loan production. In the third quarter of 2021, the volume of loans originated for investment was $3.0 billion. During this time, the net cash used in investing activities totaled $757 million. Our operating activities provided net cash of $75 million, while the net cash provided by our financing activities totaled $1.3 billion. 

CDs due to mature in one year or less as of September 30, 2021 totaled $7.6 billion, representing 87% of total CDs at that date. Our ability to retain these CDs and to attract new deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay on our deposits, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. However, there are times when we may choose not to compete for such deposits, depending on the availability of lower-cost funding, the competitiveness of the market and its impact on pricing, and our need for such deposits to fund loan demand, as previously discussed. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying dividends declared to our shareholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

The Parent Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may also depend, in part, upon dividends it receives from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the Parent Company is generally limited by New York State Banking Law and regulations, and by certain regulations of the FDIC. In addition, the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;), the FDIC, and the FRB, for reasons of safety and soundness, may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations. 

Under New York State Banking Law, a New York State-chartered stock-form savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. However, the approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Bank paid dividends totaling $285 million to the Parent Company, leaving $405 million they could dividend to the Parent Company without regulatory approval at that date. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Parent Company at September 30, 2021 included $139 million in cash and cash equivalents. If the Bank was to apply to the Superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations, there can be no assurance that such application would be approved. 

Capital Position 

On March 17, 2017, we issued 515,000 shares of preferred stock. The offering generated capital of $503 million, net of underwriting and other issuance costs, for general corporate purposes, with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the Bank. 

On October 24, 2018, the Company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved a $300 million common share repurchase program. The repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes. As of September 30, 2021, the Company has repurchased a total of 28.9 million shares at an average price of $9.63 or an aggregate purchase price of $278 million, leaving $17 million remaining under the current authorization. 

&#160; 

Stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity include AOCL, which decreased $67 million from the balance at the end of last year and $67 million from the year-ago quarter to $92 million at September 30, 2021. The year-to-date decrease was primarily the result of an $89 million change in the net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and a $15 million change in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges, net of tax, to $18 million. 

Regulatory Capital 

The Bank is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the NYSDFS and the FDIC (the &#8220;Regulators&#8221;). The Bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Such classifications are used by the FDIC to determine various matters, including prompt corrective action and each institution&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the Regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings, among other factors. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At September 30, 2021, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following table sets forth our common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, at that date:

&#160; 

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50%; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5.00%. 

Earnings Summary for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 totaled $149 million, up 28% compared to the $116 million the Company reported for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2021 totaled $140 million, up 31% compared to the $107 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2021 were $0.30, up 30% compared to the $0.23 the Company reported for the three months ended September 30, 2020. 

&#160; 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

Net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multi-family and CRE loans, as well as securities. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. 

Year-Over-Year Comparison 

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 increased $36 million or 13% on a year-over-year basis to $318 million. This increase was the result of a 29% decrease or $39 million decrease in interest expense to $97 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020, partially offset by a 1% or $3 million decrease in interest income to $415 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020. 

Details of the change in net interest income are as follows: 

&#61623; Interest income on mortgage and other loans, net was $376 million, down $4 million or 1% on a year-over-year basis, while interest income on securities totaled $37 million, down $1 million or 3% on a year-over-year basis. 

&#61623; The year-over-year decrease in interest income on loans was due to a 12 bp decrease in the average loan yield to 3.48%, partially offset by an $857 million or 2% increase in the average loan balance to $43.2 billion. 

&#61623; Average securities balances rose $909 million to $6.7 billion on a year-over-year basis, while the average yield on securities declined 39 bp to 2.21%. 

&#61623; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased $35 million or 57% on a year-over-year basis to $26 million, driven by a 50 bp decline in the average cost of deposits to 0.35%, while average interest-bearing deposit balances increased $832 million or 3% to $29.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. 

&#61623; Average non-interest bearing deposit balances increased $1.5 billion or 49% to $4.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. 

&#61623; Interest expense on borrowed funds declined $4 million or 5% to $71 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 13 bp decline in the average cost of borrowings to 1.84%, while the average borrowings balance rose $390 million or 3% to $15.5 billion. 

&#160; 

Net Interest Margin 

During the third quarter, the Company's NIM improved on a year-over-year basis, in line with the year-over-year improvement in net interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the NIM increased 15 bp to 2.44%.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the three-month periods, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

(Recovery of) Provision for Credit Losses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of $1 million compared to a $13 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year change reflects the improvement in forecasted, future economic conditions based on the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, as well as the Company recording no net charge-offs during the current quarter. 

For additional information about our provisions for and recoveries of loan losses, see the discussion of the allowances for loan losses under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; that appear earlier in this report. 

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212; fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; gains on the sale of securities; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, non-interest income totaled $15 million, up $1 million or 7% compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher fee income and other income. 

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

Non-Interest Expense 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was $135 million, up $6 million or 5% on a year-over-year basis. Included in the current third quarter non-interest expense amount is $6 million in merger-related expenses related to the pending merger with Flagstar. 

Income Tax Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, income tax expense totaled $50 million, up $12 million or 32% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due to higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 25.19% compared to 24.89% for the third quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the New York State corporate tax rate and the non-deductibility of certain merger-related expenses. 

Earnings Summary for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net income totaled $446 million, up $125 million or 39% compared to $321 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $421 million, up 42% compared to the $296 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, totaled $967 million, up $175 million or 22% compared to the $792 million the Company reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year improvement was driven entirely by lower interest expense. 

Details of the change in net interest income are as follows: 

&#61623; Interest income on mortgage and other loans, net totaled $1.1 billion, unchanged compared to the first nine months of 2020, while interest income on securities declined $8 million or 6% to $118 million. 

&#61623; Interest income on loans was driven by a $1.0 billion increase in average loan balances to $42.9 billion and by an 11 bp decline in the average loan yield to 3.56%. 

&#61623; The average yield on securities declined 41 bps to 2.38%, while the average securities balance increased $651 million or 11% to $6.7 billion. 

&#61623; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased $175 million or 67% to $87 million, driven by an 81 bp decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, while the average balance increased $488 million or 2% to $29.4 billion. 

&#61623; Average non-interest bearing deposit balances rose $1.5 billion or 53% to $4.4 billion. 

&#61623; Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $13 million or 6% to $215 million due to a 25 bp decline in the average cost of borrowings to 1.83%, partially offset by a $1.1 billion or 7% increase in the average balance to $15.7 billion. 

&#160; 

Net Interest Margin 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the NIM increased 32 bp to 2.48% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the nine-month periods, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Provision for Credit Losses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of $1 million compared to a provision for credit losses of $51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year improvement reflects the improvement in forecasted, future economic conditions, as well as net recoveries of $7 million for the first nine months of 2021 compared to net charge-offs of $13 million for the first nine months of 2020. 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212; fee income (in the form of retail 

deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; gains on the sale of securities; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, non-interest income totaled $45 million compared to $46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The year-ago nine month period included $1 million in net gains on securities compared to no such gain during the first nine months of 2021.

Non-Interest Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, total non-interest expense was $406 million, up $28 million or 7% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The current nine month period includes $16 million of merger-related expenses related to the pending merger with Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. Excluding these expenses, operating expenses were $390 million for the first nine months of the year, up $12 million or 3% compared to the first nine months of last year. 

&#160; 

Income Tax Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, income tax expense totaled $161 million, up $73 million or 83% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was related to higher pre-tax income, the non-deductibility of certain merger-related expenses, and an increase in the New York State corporate tax rate. The current nine month period also includes the revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to the increase in our New York State corporate tax rate. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2021 increased to 26.48% compared to 21.50% for the first nine months of 2020.
