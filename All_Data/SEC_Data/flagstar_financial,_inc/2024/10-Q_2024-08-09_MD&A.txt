 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Background 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company (collectively with its subsidiaries the &#8220;Company&#8221;) whose principal operation is its subsidiary Flagstar Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company has experienced a number of events in the last 18 months that have significantly impacted its balance sheet, results of operations, credit losses, liquidity and funding, and regulatory capital. At the end of 2022, the Company acquired and merged with Flagstar Bancorp Inc. which increased assets by $26 billion and liabilities by $24 billion. In March 2023 the Company acquired $38 billion of assets and assumed $36 billion of liabilities from the FDIC related to the former Signature Bridge Bank. These transactions resulted in the Company exceeding $100 billion in total assets which results in being categorized as a Category IV institution for regulatory purposes, increasing requirements and expectations related to liquidity, risk management and governance. Beginning in late 2023, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio began to experience stress, related principally to vacancy-driven declines in the office sector, and inflation and high interest rates in the multi-family sector, particularly for the sub-set of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio comprised of majority rent-regulated collateral, a portion of which is impacted by a 2019 New York law change. Concerns about the impact of these portfolio stresses led to significant declines in the Company&#8217;s stock price and large customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter of 2024. In response to these declines, the Company raised $1.05 billion in equity capital in March 2024 through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock and preferred stock convertible to common stock, and raised liquidity through brokered deposits and wholesale funding. The result of these events and conditions has led to a significantly lower net interest margin and higher loan loss provisions in 2024. Subsequent to the March 2024 capital raise, the Company&#8217;s customer deposit base stabilized, grew substantially in the second quarter 2024 and has continued to increase subsequently. 

To further simplify the Company&#8217;s operations, reduce operational risk, and begin transitioning to a more diversified regional bank, as well as enhance its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity, subsequent to the second quarter of 2024 the (i) Company completed the sale of its warehouse lending portfolio (approximately $6 billion in assets) and (ii) entered into a definitive agreement to sell its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities. These transactions will increase the Company&#8217;s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 130 basis points in aggregate upon consummation, but will decrease interest income and fee income until the resulting capital has been redeployed by the Company in lending and investing activities. These decreases will be partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with the activities being sold. 

Results of Operations 

The Company reported a second quarter 2024 net loss of $323 million compared to a net loss of $327 million in the prior quarter. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter 2024 was $333 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $335 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in the prior quarter. As adjusted for merger-related expenses, the net loss for the second quarter 2024 was $298 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders was $308 million or $1.05 per diluted share. The prior quarter net loss and diluted earnings per share included a reduction to the bargain purchase gain of $121 million arising from the Signature Transaction. As adjusted for this item and for merger-related expenses, the net loss for the prior quarter was $174 million and the net loss attributable to common stockholders was $182 million, or $0.74 per diluted share. 

For the first six months of 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $650 million compared to net income of $2.4 billion for the first six months of 2023. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first six months of 2024 was $668 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.4 billion, or $10.10 per diluted share for the first six months of 2023. Net loss and diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2024 included a reduction to the bargain purchase gain of $121 million arising from the Signature Transaction. As adjusted for this item and for merger-related expenses, the net loss for the first six months of 2024 was $472 million and the net loss attributable to common stockholders was $490 million, or $1.82 per diluted share. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2023 included a bargain purchase gain of $2.1 billion arising from the Signature Transaction. As adjusted for this item and for merger-related expenses, net income for the first six months of 2023 was $407 million and net income available to common stockholders was $391 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. The amount of our net interest income is a function of the amount of interest-earning assets we hold, the manner in which we fund these assets, including interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the interest rates we earn on assets and the interest rates we pay on liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee, and market interest rates. 

Our interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of customer deposits and funds we borrow. The average term of our fixed rate deposits is less than twelve months, therefore the cost of our deposits and most of our borrowed funds is largely based on short-term rates of interest, the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee. The yields on our held-for-investment loans and investment securities are generally more sensitive to intermediate-term market interest rates. 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our net interest income and average balance sheet for the periods indicated: Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the periods are derived from average balances that are calculated daily.

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

The Company's net interest margin for the second quarter 2024 was 1.98 percent, down 30 basis points compared to the first quarter 2024. The 30 basis point reduction was mainly driven by an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities, as well as an increase in borrowings to support a higher level of on-balance sheet liquidity associated with regulatory requirements. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a full quarter of the change in funding mix following the deposit mix shift and increase in wholesale borrowings that occurred during the first quarter 2024. The first quarter 2024 decline in lower rate deposits and increase in certificates of deposits, along with the increase in borrowed funds, was primarily driven by customer withdrawals of uninsured deposits following the credit rating agency downgrades of our Company&#8217;s debt and deposit ratings by third-party credit rating agencies in February and March 2024. These elevated withdrawals resulted in the Company raising liquidity through brokered deposits and borrowings. Subsequent to the $1.05 billion capital investment in March 2024, our customer deposits stabilized and in the second quarter 2024, customer deposits grew approximately $3 billion. We expect to utilize liquidity from the second quarter 2024 deposit growth, continued deposit growth in the third quarter 2024, and asset sale transactions closing in the third quarter of 2024 to reduce short term and other borrowings. 

A substantial portion of our loan portfolio have fixed rates through repricing dates which extend several years. Because most of these loans were originated when market rates were lower than present rates, they have a negative impact to our net interest margin. However, upon reaching repricing option dates, the resulting rate resets will increase our interest income if higher interest rates persist. See table under Loan Maturity and Repricing. Other factors affecting the amount of our net interest income for the second quarter 2024 include a $1.1 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first six months of 2024, net interest margin was 2.13 percent, down 81 basis points compared to the first six months of 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter 2024 and the resulting shift in deposit mix to higher cost certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings. 

Other factors affecting net interest income for the first six months 2024 compared to the first six months 2023 include: 

&#8226; A $1.7 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 

&#8226; A $6.2 billion increase in average loan balances driven by the assets acquired in the Signature Transaction that closed on March 20, 2023. 

&#8226; An increase in the average loan yield primarily due to the impact of multi-family loans repricing to higher rates upon reaching the end of their initial fixed rate periods. 

&#8226; A 45 basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities driven by lower rate securities maturing and being replaced with higher rate securities, consistent with the increase in market interest rates. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the second quarter 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $390 million compared to a $315 million provision for the first quarter 2024. The provision reflects an increase in charge-offs, principally relating to larger-balance office loans, and the continuing impact of market conditions on the multi-family portfolio as higher rates and inflationary impacts persist. 

Net charge-offs totaled $349 million for the second quarter 2024 compared with $81 million for the first quarter 2024 primarily driven primarily by an increase in classified office loans and receipt of appraisals on those loans. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first six months of 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $705 million compared to a $219 million provision for the first six months of 2023. The provision reflects substantial increases in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and charge-offs during the current period, principally related to risk rating downgrades on commercial real estate and multi-family loans with upcoming maturities or repricing for which the estimated property net operating income would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms, as well as underlying collateral value declines principally in the office portfolio. 

Net charge-offs totaled $430 million for the first six months of 2024, compared with a net recovery of $1 million for the first six months of 2023 primarily driven by an increase in classified loans in the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolios and underlying collateral value declines. 

Non-Interest Income 

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

The bargain purchase gain reduction recorded in the first quarter represented the final measurement period adjustment related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Signature Transaction. 

Loss on loan administration activities was $5 million for the second quarter 2024 compared to income of $16 million for the first quarter 2024 driven by a $9 million increase in interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits and a $10 million decrease in servicing income that was driven by the conclusion of our servicing agreement with the FDIC related to the Signature Transaction in March 2024. As a result of the Company&#8217;s third quarter 2024 agreement to sell its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities, substantially all income associate with servicing rights, gain on loan sales, and loan administration income will cease upon consummation of the transaction, which is expected in early fourth quarter 2024. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

The decrease in loan administration fee income was a result of an $11 million increase in interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits, and the conclusion of the FDIC servicing agreement, lower net gain on loan sales and securitizations reflected the impact of higher rates driving substantially lower mortgage loan production volume. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The following table summarizes our non-interest expense for the respective periods: 

Three Months Ended, Six Months Ended, (in millions) June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits $ 312 $ 333 $ 645 $ 508 FDIC insurance 91 50 141 37 Occupancy and equipment 52 52 104 87 General and administrative 183 186 369 275 Total operating expense 638 621 1,259 907 Intangible asset amortization 33 35 68 54 Merger-related and restructuring expenses 34 43 77 176 Total non-interest expense $ 705 $ 699 $ 1,404 $ 1,137 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

Total operating expenses were $17 million higher in the second quarter 2024 than the first quarter 2024. Compensation and benefits expense decreased due to a reduction in employees and seasonal factors in the first quarter such as payroll taxes and, 401(k) matching. FDIC insurance expense increased during the period due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans and other factors affecting the assessment rate. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Total operating expenses for the first six months of 2024 were up $352 million compared to the first six months of 2023. This increase was largely due to the Signature Transaction, including an increase in the number of employees, higher occupancy costs related to an increase in number of Company locations, and the higher regulatory costs described previously. 

We expect our expenses will decrease approximately $100 million per quarter related to the sale of the mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities upon consummation of those transactions. 

Income Tax Expense 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the second quarter 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $101 million compared to a benefit of $54 million for the first quarter 2024. The benefit for the second quarter 2024 was driven by the higher book loss for the quarter, primarily attributable to the provision for credit losses. Certain non-deductible items impact the Company's effective tax rate, including FDIC insurance expense, and the bargain purchase gain adjustment. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first six months of 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $155 million compared to an income tax expense of $80 million for the first six months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2024 was 19.25 percent compared to 3.21 percent in the first six months of 2023. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Balance Sheet Summary 

Total assets increased $5.0 billion to $119.1 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $114.1 billion at December 31, 2023, principally related to increasing on-balance sheet liquidity in cash and cash equivalents. 

Total loans and leases held for investment decreased $10.1 billion to $74.6 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $84.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the transfer of the warehouse loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale and decreases in commercial real estate and multi-family loans as the Company decreases its concentration in these portfolios. 

The securities portfolio increased $1.4 billion to $10.5 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $9.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Our securities portfolio is classified as available-for-sale with low credit risk U.S. government agency bonds comprising over 90 percent of the total portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These instruments are recorded at fair value and interest rate driven unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Total deposits decreased $2.5 billion, to $79.0 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $81.5 billion at December 31, 2023. In February and March 2024, we experienced $9.7 billion customer deposit attrition following downgrades in our debt and deposit ratings by third-party credit rating agencies. On March 6, 2024 we announced a $1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized for the remainder of the first quarter 2024. In response to the customer deposit attrition, we replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through $4.1 billion in brokered certificates of deposit and $5.5 billion of wholesale borrowings. Subsequently in the second quarter 2024, targeted deposit gathering programs and customer engagement increased customer deposits $3 billion.

Multi-Family Loans 

The multi-family loan portfolio was $36.0 billion at June 30, 2024, down $1.3 billion compared to $37.3 billion at December 31, 2023, which is reflective of our continuing efforts to diversify our portfolio as borrowers without a deposit relationship seek more favorable loan terms with other lenders. 

Our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower, particularly the loan-to-value of the property. 

The majority of our multi-family loans are secured by rental apartment buildings. At June 30, 2024, $20.4 billion or 57 percent of the Company&#8217;s total multi-family loan portfolio was secured by properties in New York State, many of which are subject to rent regulation laws to varying degrees. The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the "Act") significantly limits the ability to increase rents on regulated apartments upon vacancy. These limitations may reduce a borrower&#8217;s ability to generate additional revenues on those units to offset higher operating expenses due to inflation and the current interest rate environment, which could result in lower net operating income and could impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to satisfy repayment obligations during the term of the loan. In addition, the level of income generated by the property may be insufficient to qualify for refinancing at maturity. The impact on current and future cash flows has adversely impacted the value of properties with a high concentration of rent regulated units which has increased charge-offs in 2024. 

To mitigate our exposure to rent regulated properties, we are curtailing future originations of loans secured by rent-regulated properties and focusing originations and renewal retention on borrowers with whom we will have broader customer relationships beyond lending. Property values in this loan sector have decreased substantially since origination due to unfavorable market conditions. The appraised value used in our loan-to-value ratio is determined using an income approach to estimate the stabilized value of the collateral by applying a market driven capitalization rate to the stabilized cash flow of the property. 

Our multi-family loan portfolio had $15.4 billion outstanding with an interest-only payment at June 30, 2024. The weighted average interest-only period remaining was 22 months as of June 30, 2024 , with approximately 60 percent of these loans entering their amortization period by the end of 2025. 

We continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses, particularly 

given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multi-family markets. Although occupancy levels have historically tended to be stable due to below market rents, rent-regulated loans that are repricing are incurring debt service levels that, when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, approach or exceed some properties&#8217; net operating income and may require the borrower to support the loan from sources unrelated to the collateral until elevated interest rates subside. 

The following table presents a geographical analysis of the multi-family loans in our held-for-investment loan portfolio:

Commercial Real Estate 

At June 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans represented $10.0 billion, or 13.4 percent, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a $509 million decrease compared to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2023 primarily due to payoffs. 

Certain of our commercial real estate loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower, particularly the loan-to-value of the property. 

The commercial real estate loans we originate are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. Occupancy levels for office space have declined substantially over the past three years which has had an impact on borrowers' net operating income and their ability to cover debt service. These unfavorable market conditions also lower the value of underlying collateral which has had a material impact on loan charge-offs in 2024.

Commercial and Industrial 

The commercial and industrial loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses and finance companies. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, and revolving lines of credit. 

A broad range of commercial and industrial loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of commercial and industrial loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At June 30, 2024, one-to-four family loans represented $5.8 billion, inclusive of $860 million of loans with government guarantees, or 7.8 percent of total loans held for investment, compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, the repurchase liability on loans with government guarantees was $374 million. The repurchase obligations and related assets will transfer to the buyer of our mortgage activities upon consummation of that sale. As of June 30, 2024, non-government guaranteed loans in this portfolio had an average current FICO score of 742 and an average LTV of 51 percent. 

Other Loans 

At June 30, 2024, other loans totaled $1.8 billion and consisted primarily of home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans, including overdraft loans. 

Our home equity portfolio includes home equity loans, second mortgage loans and home equity line of credits. As of June 30, 2024, loans in this portfolio had an average curre nt FICO score of 751. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale at June 30, 2024 totaled $7.8 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent with regard to loans originated as held for investment. Our mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. 

During the second quarter 2024 we transferred all of our warehouse loans to held for sale. This balance was $6.4 billion at June 30, 2024. We completed the sale of the warehouse loan portfolio in the third quarter 2024. 

Securities 

Total securities were $10.5 billion, or 9 percent of total assets, at June 30, 2024, compared to $9.2 billion, or 8 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2023 . At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our securities were designated as &#8220;Available-for-Sale&#8221;. At June 30, 2024, 20 percent of our portfolio are floating rate securities. 

As of June 30, 2024, the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of tax, was $674 million, compared to $581 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. 

At June 30, 2024, available-for-sale securities had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Included in the quarter-end amount were mortgage-related securities of $8.5 billion and other debt securities of $2.1 billion. 

At the prior year-end, available-for-sale securities were $9.2 billion and had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Mortgage-related securities accounted for $6.6 billion of the year-end balance, with other debt securities accounting for the remaining $2.6 billion.

Borrowed Funds 

The majority of our borrowed funds consist of wholesale borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, Discount Window advances and draws under the Bank Term Funding Program from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRB"), repurchase agreements, and, to a lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At June 30, 2024, total borrowed funds increased $7.6 billion to $28.9 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2023. 

Wholesale Borrowings 

Wholesale borrowings at June 30, 2024 were $27.9 billion compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 

FHLB advances increased to $22.8 billion at June 30, 2024 from $19.3 billion at December 31, 2023. FHLB advances are secured by eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities, under blanket collateral agreements with the FHLB. $750 million of our wholesale borrowings had callable features at June 30, 2024 and $2.0 billion had callable features at December 31, 2023. Additionally, $1.0 billion was drawn on the Bank Term Funding Program, secured by eligible securities. The increase in FHLB advances at June 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was driven by our actions to bolster on-balance sheet liquidity. 

In the second quarter 2024 the Company borrowed $4.0 billion from the FRB, secured by various loan and investment security collateral. This discount window advance matures in September 2024. Additionally the Company has $1.0 billion drawn under the Bank Term Funding Program which matures in December 2024. Available liquidity from customer deposit growth and the sale of warehouse lending portfolio will be used to repay these borrowings. 

Repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2024 were $121 million. We did not have any repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2023 . These agreements primarily use government-sponsored enterprise ("GSE") obligations as collateral and were entered into with either the FHLB or specific brokerage firms. 

See Note 11, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings, our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt. 

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

At June 30, 2024, the Company had $1.0 billion of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $861 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. The Company maintains an investment in FHLB stock partly in conjunction with its membership in the FHLB and partly related to its access to the FHLB funding it utilizes. The increase in FHLB-NY stock was primarily related to increased borrowings in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $218 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, at cost. 

Credit Risk 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent as described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Credit Quality 

It is our practice to continually review the risk in our loan portfolio. The Company receives financial information from borrowers annually, and most of the financial information is received in the second calendar quarter. At June 30, 2024, the Company had received updated financial information on approximately 80 percent of the multi-family loan portfolio. Upon receipt of updated borrower financial information, we perform an analysis to determine whether the cash flow from the underlying collateral is sufficient to meet the contractual loan payments, commonly referred to as the debt service coverage ratio. We consider the ability to cover debt service based upon the current contractual rate, or where a borrower&#8217;s initial fixed rate period expires within 18 months, the lowest contractual rate reset option available under the loan terms using the current level for referenced indices. Loans for which the collateral does not have a debt service coverage ratio of 1.0 or higher under this analysis are rated substandard. We order appraisals for all substandard loans. Where an appraisal does not support recovery of the loan carrying amount for collateral-dependent loans, we classify the loan as non-accrual, regardless of payment status, and charge the loan down to its recoverable amount. Once an appraisal is ordered it takes approximately two to three months to receive and appropriately review the results. Non-accrual loans are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if an adjustment to the amount of impairment is required. Loans that are on non-accrual and, separately, the largest individual non-accrual borrowers are reported and reviewed with the Credit Committee of the Board of Directors at least quarterly. 

The Company conducted a thorough review of its largest 350 real estate loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024. This review continued in the second quarter of 2024 to cover approximately 75 pe rcent of the unpaid principal balance of the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolio. 

Classified loans increased $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024 . These downgrades were principally related to loans with upcoming maturities or repricing where the estimated net operating income of the property would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms, or the underlying collateral values are estimated to have declined to at or below the loan carrying amount. Classified loans reflect the potential that a loss may occur if deficiencies in the primary source of repayment are unable to be corrected and borrowers are unwilling or unable to otherwise support the loans. Refer to Note 6 in Item 1, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional details. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

A loan generally is classified as a &#8220;non-accrual&#8221; loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is in non-accrual, we cease recording interest income on the loan, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income, and any subsequent interest collected is recorded as a reduction in the loan carrying amount. A loan is returned to accrual status only when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. At June 30, 2024, $1.1 billion of non-accrual loans were current based on their existing payment terms. 

In accordance with our charge-off policy, collateral-dependent loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to support these efforts. Charge-offs of $388 million were recorded on commercial real estate and multi-family loans during the six months ended June 30, 2024 , primarily driven by appraisals received on those loans. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for non-accrual loans that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, commercial real estate properties, or land, if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered at least annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans that are not showing signs of credit weakness. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan, or when we determine an updated appraisal is needed as a result of our ongoing credit analysis. We evaluate loans that were previously placed on non-accrual at least quarterly to determine if additional charge-offs may be needed. 

Properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as other real estate owned before foreclosure and to re-appraise the properties on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s condition.

$ 1,959 $ 442 $ 1,517 343 % 

(1) Includes home equity, consumer and other loans. 

During the second quarter 2024, the Company received updated financial information for a substantial portion of the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolio. Additionally a substantial number of appraisals on loans exhibiting credit weakness were received, which resulted in an increase in non-accrual loans during the quarter. Approximately 60 percent of our non-accrual loans are current on their contractual payment terms. In determining whether to place a loan on non-accrual we have considered whether a borrower will be able to service its debt under terms expected within the next 18 months based on current collateral and net operating income. Where net operating income is below the projected debt service and the collateral value is below the loan amount, we place loans on non-accrual. Updated financial information from borrowers and appraisals received have led to an increase in non-accruals loans in 2024. 

The following table sets forth the changes in non-accrual loans over the first six months of 2024:

At June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases was $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, up $276 million. Market interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next 18 months. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 

Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs various economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for multi-family loans. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to 1.70 percent at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2023. Excluding loans with government guarantees and warehouse loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.72 percent at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2023.

Liquidity Risk 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

We monitor our liquidity daily, and more frequently during times of stress. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. Additional liquidity stems from deposits, wholesale funding sources (including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits) and approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the FHLB. These funding sources depend on the amount of mortgage loan collateral and available securities pledged. The Bank also has agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank to access the discount window, pledging certain loans and securities as collateral. 

The following table summarizes our total liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:

At June 30, 2024, our total liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, high-quality liquid assets and borrowing capacity), was $33.9 billion. The $7.5 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by actions to further bolster our liquidity position. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its warehouse loan portfolio, further increasing available liquidity by approximately $6 billion. 

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms. The majority of our deposits are retail in nature (i.e., they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations); however, we also utilize brokered deposits depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources. From December 31, 2023 to March 7, 2024, we experienced $9.7 billion in core deposit attrition following the credit rating agency downgrades of our Company's credit and deposit ratings in February and March 2024. On March 6, 2024, we announced a $1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized. We replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through brokered certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings. 

The following table presents the composition of the Company's brokered deposits: 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Brokered money market accounts $ 233 $ 1,258 Brokered interest-bearing checking accounts represented 1,532 1,599

Uninsured Deposits 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. As a result, we have total liquidity of $33.9 billion, which exceeds the balance of our uninsured deposits by $18.9 billion. Our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000). These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts. 

At June 30, 2024, our deposit base includes $15.0 billion of uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits decreased following our earnings announcement in January 2024 and subsequent credit rating agency downgrades of our credit ratings in February and March 2024. Our customer deposits stabilized following the announcement of the $1.05 billion capital raise in March 2024, and subsequently increased $3 billion in the second quarter 2024. 

Credit Ratings 

We maintain credit ratings from three rating agencies: Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS. As of each of the dates indicated, our credit ratings were as follows:

The primary mortgage loan agencies maintain standards that define the criteria that must be met for an institution to qualify as an eligible custodial depository for the deposits related to loans owned by those entities, including have an investment grade short-term issuer/deposit rating from Moody&#8217;s or S&#38;P. We are currently not in compliance with that criteria. We have received a waiver of these criteria for all of our custodial deposits which could be revoked at any of the agencies' discretion. We have no other direct contractual relationships tied to further downgrades in our credit ratings, but may suffer reputational risk that could have an adverse effect on our business should that occur. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer certificates of deposit with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At June 30, 2024, we had certificates of deposit of $28.8 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of $16.5 billion. 

We also are obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our back-office responsibilities. These obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition in other liabilities and totaled $436 million at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $10 million compared to $446 million at December 31, 2023. 

At June 30, 2024, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by and financial stand-by letters of credit. These commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 

Based upon our current cash and cash equivalent balance of $19.0 billion and our total liquidity position of $33.9 billion, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 

For the second quarter 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At June 30, 2024, the Parent Company held cash and cash equivalents of $651 million. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our common and preferred stockholders. 

Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would require the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfer to paid-in capital. The term &#8220;net profits&#8221; is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024. In connection with receiving regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the Signature Transaction, the Bank has committed that (i) for a period of two years from the date of the Signature Transaction, it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and (ii) it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In the first six months of 2024, dividends of $67 million were paid by the Bank to the Parent Company. We have reduced our quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders to $0.01 per common share and we do not anticipate material dividends from the Bank to the Parent Company in the near future until the Company is able to achieve a return to repeatable operating income. 

At June 30, 2024, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations through 2028. 

Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility, which represents our primary market risk. Changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Board of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may, in turn, be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayment rates, current market value spreads, and deposit decay rates and betas. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2024, the following table sets forth our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) Estimated Percentage Change in Economic Value of Equity -200 shock 4.9% -100 shock 3.2% +100 shock (3.2)% +200 shock (7.0)% &#160; 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

During the second quarter of 2024, we terminated all of our derivatives that were designated in a cash flow or fair value hedge relationship. This action reduced our asset sensitivity resulting in a relatively neutral position. 

While the EVE analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

Interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income ("NII") simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios. Modeling changes in NII requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NII analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2024, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) (1) 

Estimated Percentage Change in Future Net Interest Income -200 shock (3.1)% -100 shock (1.1)% +100 shock 0.3% +200 shock 0.4% 

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged. 

The net changes in NII presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our EVE, and/or NII simulations. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would inform the Board of Directors and undertake actions to remediate, generally through capital market transactions. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#8226; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#8226; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#8226; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#8226; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At June 30, 2024, our analysis indicated that a further inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 0.5 percent increase in net interest income; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 1.2 percent decrease in net interest income. 

Regulatory Capital 

The Company is a bank holding company subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is national bank subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank is subject to the Prompt Corrective Action regulatory capital framework that establishes five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; An institution&#8217;s capital category affects various matters, including legal requirements for regulators to take prompt corrective action and the level of a bank&#8217;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weighting assets, among other factors, and the regulators have discretion to require that institutions maintain capital in excess of minimum levels. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At June 30, 2024, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following tables set forth the common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios for the Company on a 

consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, as of the dates shown: 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company: 

Risk-Based Capital June 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital $ 8,187 9.54 % $ 8,948 10.43 % $ 10,965 12.78 % $ 8,948 7.53 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,862 4.50 5,149 6.00 6,866 8.00 4,751 4.00 Excess $ 4,325 5.04 % $ 3,799 4.43 % $ 4,099 4.78 % $ 4,197 3.53 % December 31, 2023 Total capital $ 8,009 9.05 % $ 8,512 9.62 % $ 10,415 11.77 % $ 8,512 7.75 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,983 4.50 5,310 6.00 7,081 8.00 4,392 4.00 Excess $ 4,026 4.55 % $ 3,202 3.62 % $ 3,334 3.77 % $ 4,120 3.75 % 

The increase in our capital ratios from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a $1.05 billion capital investment in the first quarter 2024. At the date of the investment, $413 million of the capital investment was recorded in common equity, with the remainder in mezzanine equity until the associated preferred stock is converted or exchanged into common stock. In the second quarter 2024, a portion of the preferred stock converted to common stock. At June 30, 2024, $258 million of the capital investment remains in mezzanine equity. The conversion or exchange of the remaining convertible preferred stock will increase our common equity tier 1 approximately 30 basis points. Refer to Note 17 - Mezzanine and Stockholders' Equity for additional details. 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank: 

Risk-Based Capital June 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital $ 9,286 10.84 % $ 9,286 10.84 % $ 10,360 12.09 % $ 9,286 7.82 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,855 4.50 5,140 6.00 6,854 8.00 4,749 4.00 Excess $ 5,431 6.34 % $ 4,146 4.84 % $ 3,506 4.09 % $ 4,537 3.82 % December 31, 2023 Total capital $ 9,305 10.52 % $ 9,305 10.52 % $ 10,271 11.61 % $ 9,305 8.48 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,980 4.50 5,307 6.00 7,076 8.00 4,389 4.00 Excess $ 5,325 6.02 % $ 3,998 4.52 % $ 3,195 3.61 % $ 4,916 4.48 % 

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50 percent; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5 percent. 

On July 22, 2024 the Company announced that it had closed on the sale of approximately $6 billion of mortgage warehouse loans to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Company expects to close on an additional $200 million of mortgage warehouse loans in the near future. In total, these transactions will increase the common equity tier 1 ratio approximately 70 basis points. 

On July 25, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential mortgage servicing business, including mortgage servicing rights and third-party origination platform to Mr. Cooper, a leading mortgage originator and servicer for approximately $1.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon closing, the Company expects that the transaction will increase the common equity tier 1 ratios approximately 60 basis points. 

Other Recent Developments 

On November 16, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC continues to provide an updated estimate of each institution&#8217;s quarterly and total special assessment expense and while we expect this may result in an increase, we do not expect the increase to be material. The final rule calls for the FDIC to collect special assessments over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 which was paid in June 2024. 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to both the Company and the Bank. In general, the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for Category III and IV banking organizations with the methodology applicable to Category I and II banking organizations. In addition to calculating risk-weighted assets under the current U.S. standardized approach, the proposal introduces a new &#8220;Expanded Risk-Based Approach,&#8221; including standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models. If adopted as proposed, the Company and the Bank would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the current U.S. standardized approach and the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and lower thresholds for deductions from CET1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets, among other things. The proposal, if enacted, would have an effective date of July 1, 2025, with certain elements, such as the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital and changes in risk-weighted assets calculated under the Expanded Risk-Based Approach, having a three-year phase-in period. We are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the Company and the Bank if adopted as proposed. 

On August 29, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require large banks, or those with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) that can be used, in the instance of a bank&#8217;s failure, to absorb losses and increase options to resolve the failed bank. Under the proposal, the required minimum amount of LTD would be the greater of 6 percent of an entity&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets, 3.5 percent of an entity&#8217;s average total consolidated assets, or 2.5 percent of an entity&#8217;s total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. Debt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum LTD requirement would need to be unsecured, have maturities greater than one year and have plain vanilla features (e.g., no structured notes or credit sensitive instruments). The proposal would further subject banks to certain &#8220;clean holding-company&#8221; requirements, such as a prohibition on entering into derivatives with external counterparties. The proposal would provide a three-year transition period with the incremental phase-in of the requirements during this period. 

We identified certain material weaknesses in management's report on internal control over financial reporting included within Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our progress toward remediation as of June 30, 2024 is discussed within Item 4 of this Form 10-Q. We do not expect the cost to remediate these material weaknesses to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

While diluted earnings per common share, net income, net income available to common stockholders, and total non-interest income are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with GAAP, financial measures that adjust these GAAP measures to exclude expenses and the bargain purchase gains related to our merger with Flagstar and the Signature transaction, and initial provision for credit losses are non-GAAP measures. Nevertheless, it is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in our earnings release and other investor communications because they are not considered part of recurring operations and are included because the Company believes they may provide useful supplemental information for evaluating the underlying performance trends of the Company.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain accounting policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, are described in Item 1. These policies relate to: (a) the determination of our allowance for credit losses, (b) valuation of mortgage servicing rights and (c) the acquisition method of accounting. We believe the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations and/or financial condition. 

For further information on our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on our website, under the Investor Relations section, or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at sec.gov. 

Signature Transaction - Certain Financial Information 

In accordance with the guidance provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1:K, &#8220;Financial Statements of Acquired Troubled Financial Institutions&#8221; (&#8220;SAB 1:K&#8221;) the Company has omitted certain financial information on the Signature Transaction required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and Article 11 of Regulation S-X. SAB 1:K provides relief from the requirements of Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of Regulation S-X under certain circumstances, including a transaction such as the Signature Transaction, in which the registrant engages in an acquisition of a troubled financial institution for which historical financial statements are not reasonably available or relevant and in which federal assistance is an essential and significant part of the transaction. 

Reportable Segment and Reporting Units 

We operate in a single reportable segment and have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment. We are currently in the process of reassessing our reportable segments and reporting units, which may result in a change to either or both in future reporting periods.

Liquidity 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand, and to meet our financial obligations. 

Basis of Presentation 

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information on the Company's accounting policies. 

The accompanying financial statements of the Company and other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements. The accompanying financial statements of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses, mortgage servicing rights and the acquisition method of accounting. 

All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company currently has certain unconsolidated subsidiaries in the form of wholly-owned statutory business trusts, which were formed to issue guaranteed capital securities. See Note 11 &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; for additional information regarding these trusts. 

When necessary, certain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

Standard Description Effect on Financial Statements 

ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions 

This Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. 

Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2023-08, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other&#8212;Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets 

The amendments in this update require entities that hold certain crypto assets to measure such assets at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income in each reporting period, along with other presentation and disclosure matters. 

Adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Company does not hold and has no plans to hold crypto assets. 

ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements&#8212;Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements 

This Update contains amendments to the Codification that remove references to various Concepts Statements. In most instances, the references are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance.

Note 2 - Computation of Earnings per Common Share 

Earnings per Common Share (Basic and Diluted) 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the same method as basic earnings per share, however, the computation reflects the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding in-the-money stock options were exercised and converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include warrants, convertible preferred stock, stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. As the average common share price was above the $ 7.50 per share exercise price (on an as-converted common stock basis) of the warrants, the corresponding 105 million common shares underlying the shares of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Series D NVCE Stock"), underlying such warrants would have been included in the dilutive share count if the Company had positive earnings for the period (reflective of the reverse stock split discussed in Note 19 - Subsequent Events). 

Unvested stock-based compensation awards containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends paid on the Company&#8217;s common stock are considered participating securities, and therefore are included in the two-class method for calculating earnings per share. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends on the common stock. The Company grants restricted stock to certain employees under its stock-based compensation plan. Recipients receive cash dividends during the vesting periods of these awards, including on the unvested portion of such awards. Since these dividends are non-forfeitable, the unvested awards are considered participating securities and therefore have earnings allocated to them. 

The following table reflects basic and diluted weighted average shares and net income (loss) per share giving effect to the reverse stock split as if it had been effective for all periods presented (See Note 19 - Subsequent Events):

Note 3 - Business Combinations 

Signature Bridge Bank 

On March 20, 2023, the Company&#8217;s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), as receiver (the "FDIC Receiver") of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. (&#8220;Signature&#8221;) to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Signature (the &#8220;Signature Transaction&#8221;). Headquartered in New York, New York, Signature was a full-service commercial bank that operated 29 branches in New York, seven branches in California, two branches in North Carolina, one branch in Connecticut, and one branch in Nevada. In connection with the Signature Transaction the Bank assumed all of Signature&#8217;s branches. The Bank acquired only certain parts of Signature it believes to be financially and strategically complementary that are intended to enhance the Company&#8217;s future growth. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company was not required to make a cash payment to the FDIC on March 20, 2023 as consideration for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The final settlement process between the Company and the FDIC concluded upon the one-year anniversary of the Signature Transaction. In addition, as part of the consideration for the Signature Transaction, the Company granted the FDIC equity appreciation rights in the common stock of the Company under an equity appreciation instrument (the "Equity Appreciation Instrument"). On March 31, 2023, the Company issued 13,010,668 shares of Company common stock to the FDIC pursuant to the Equity Appreciation Instrument. On May 19, 2023, the FDIC completed the secondary offering of those shares. 

The Company has determined that the Signature Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Accordingly, the Company recorded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 20, 2023, which was subject to adjustment for up to one year after March 20, 2023 (the &#8220;Measurement Period&#8221;). The Measurement Period concluded on March 20, 2024, and the Company has finalized its review of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Under the Agreement, the Company provided certain services to the FDIC to assist the FDIC in its administration of certain assets and liabilities which were not assumed by the Company and which remain under the control of the FDIC (the &#8220;Interim Servicing&#8221;). The FDIC reimbursed the Company for costs associated with the Interim Servicing based upon an agreed upon fee which approximates the cost to provide such services. The Interim Servicing was completed in March 2024. 

The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash &#64258;ows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. 

A summary of the net assets acquired and the estimated fair value adjustments resulting in the bargain purchase gain is as follows: 

(in millions) March 20, 2023 Net assets acquired before fair value adjustments $ 2,973 &#160; Fair value adjustments: Loans ( 727 ) Core deposit and other intangibles 464 &#160; Certificates of deposit 27 &#160; Other net assets and liabilities 39 &#160; FDIC Equity Appreciation Instrument ( 85 ) Deferred tax liability ( 690 ) Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as initially reported $ 2,001 &#160; 

Adjustments related to items identified subsequent to the initial reporting period as of March 20, 2023: 

Measurement period adjustments, excluding taxes ( 134 ) Change in deferred tax liability 143 &#160; Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as adjusted $ 2,010 &#160; 

In connection with the Signature Transaction, the Company recorded a bargain purchase gain, as adjusted, of approximately $ 2.0 billion. This includes a $ 121 million reduction in the bargain purchase gain during the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to final adjustments to the fair value of assets received and liabilities assumed, including the in-transit and other shared accounts. This adjustment is included in non-interest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income for the six months ended June 30, 2024. No adjustments have been made subsequent to the conclusion of the Measurement Period on March 20, 2024. 

The bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including cash payments received from the FDIC) over the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed and was influenced significantly by the FDIC-assisted transaction process. 

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and consideration paid in the Signature Transaction were recorded at their estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s best estimates using information available at the date of the Signature Transaction. The following table provides the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the Signature Transaction: 

(in millions) As Initially Reported Measurement Period Adjustments As Adjusted Purchase Price consideration $ 85 &#160; $ 85 &#160; Fair value of assets acquired: Cash &#38; cash equivalents 25,043 &#160; ( 142 ) 24,901 &#160; Loans held for sale 232 &#160; 232 &#160; Loans held for investment: Commercial and industrial 10,102 &#160; ( 214 ) 9,888 &#160; Commercial real estate 1,942 &#160; ( 262 ) 1,680 &#160; Consumer and other 174 &#160; ( 1 ) 173 &#160; Total loans held for investment 12,218 &#160; ( 477 ) 11,741 &#160; CDI and other intangible assets 464 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 464 &#160; Other assets 679 &#160; ( 266 ) 413 &#160; Total assets acquired 38,636 &#160; ( 885 ) 37,751 &#160; Fair value of liabilities assumed: Deposits 33,568 &#160; ( 61 ) 33,507 &#160; Other liabilities 2,982 &#160; ( 833 ) 2,149 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 36,550 &#160; ( 894 ) 35,656 &#160; Fair value of net identifiable assets 2,086 &#160; 9 &#160; 2,095 &#160; Bargain purchase gain $ 2,001 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 2,010 &#160; 

During the Measurement Period, the Company recorded adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans and leases acquired based on information received after the transaction date, and to adjust other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities for balances ultimately retained by the FDIC. The Company also recognized a net change in the deferred tax liability due to the measurement period adjustments and the secondary offering of shares completed by the FDIC. 

The Company has incurred approximately $ 259 million in costs related to the Signature Transaction primarily for legal, advisory, system conversion and other professional services. These costs are recorded within Merger-related and restructuring expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, reflecting assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability. In some cases, the estimation of fair values requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. 

See Note 3 - Business Combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information regarding the Signature Transaction, including methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Unaudited Pro Forma Information &#8211; Signature Transaction 

The Company&#8217;s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Signature subsequent to the acquisition on 

March 20, 2023. Due to the use of multiple systems and integration of the operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former Signature operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition. 

Signature was only in operation from March 12, 2023 to March 20, 2023 and does not have historical financial information on which we could base pro forma information. Additionally, we did not acquire all assets or assume all liabilities of Signature and the historical operations are not consistent with the transaction. Therefore, it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the Signature Transaction in accordance with ASC 805-10-50-2.

The investment securities having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at June 30, 2024 consisted of two hundred thirty-seven agency collateralized mortgage obligations, six capital trusts notes, six asset-backed securities, twelve corporate bonds, thirty-six US government agency bonds, three hundred thirty-four mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, one municipal bond, two private collateralized mortgage obligations and one foreign note. The investment securities designated as having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at December 31, 2023 consisted of eighty-four agency collateralized mortgage obligations, six capital trusts notes, eight asset-backed securities, twelve corporate bonds, thirty-seven US government agency bonds, three hundred two mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, one foreign debt and one municipal bond. 

The Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions at least quarterly to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required. We also assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither of these criteria are met, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount 

that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024 the Company recorded a $ 3 million allowance for credit losses related to a corporate debt security compared to $ 1 million recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

None of the remaining unrealized losses identified as of June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuers&#8217; ability to honor redemption obligations. Rather, the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 

Note 6 - Loans and Leases 

The Company classifies loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity as loans held for investment. We report loans held for investment loans at their amortized cost, which includes the outstanding principal balance adjusted for any unamortized premiums, discounts, deferred fees and unamortized fair value adjustments for acquired loans:

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale at June 30, 2024 totaled $ 7.8 billion, up from $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. During the second quarter, we transferred all warehouse loans from the commercial and industrial portfolio within loans held for investment to loans held for sale. This balance was $ 6.4 billion at June 30, 2024. 

We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent about holding for investment. Loans held for sale are carried at fair value. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, approximately $ 6 billion of the warehouse loans were sold at their carrying amounts. Refer to Note 19 - Subsequent Events. 

Asset Quality 

All asset quality information excludes loans with government guarantees that are insured by U.S. government agencies. A s of June 30, 2024, these loans totaled $ 486 million. 

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases recording interest income, and previously accrued interest is reversed against interest income. A loan is only returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest received on non-accrual loans is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had no loans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing.

The classifications in the preceding tables are the most currently available and generally have been updated within the last twelve months. In addition, they follow regulatory guidelines and can generally be described as follows: pass loans are of satisfactory quality; special mention loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention; substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged (these loans have a well-defined weakness and there is a possibility that the Company will sustain some loss); and non-accrual loans, which based on existing circumstances, have weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. One-to-four family loans are classified based on the duration of the delinquency. 

When management determines that foreclosure is probable for loans that are individually evaluated, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral adjusted for selling costs. When the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the collateral-dependent practical expedient has been elected and expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. For commercial real estate loans, collateral properties include office buildings, warehouse/distribution buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings, residential and commercial tract development. The primary source of repayment on these loans is expected to come from the sale, permanent financing or lease of the real property collateral. Commercial real estate loans are impacted by fluctuations in collateral values, as well as the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing. 

The following table summarizes the recorded investment of the Company&#8217;s collateral-dependent loans held for investment by collateral type as of June 30, 2024:

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 59 million and $ 81 million of residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure, respectively. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

When borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty, the Company may make certain loan modifications as part of loss mitigation strategies to maximize expected payment. Modifications in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension that have occurred in the current reporting period to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are disclosed along with the financial impact of the modifications.

At June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases was $ 1.3 billion compared to $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, up $ 276 million. Market interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next 18 months. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 

Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for multi-family loans. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $ 58 million and $ 52 million, respectively. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to 1.70 percent at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2023. Excluding loans with government guarantees and warehouse loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.72 percent at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2023.

Note 8 - Leases 

Lessor Arrangements 

The Company is a lessor in the equipment finance business where it has executed direct financing leases (&#8220;lease finance receivables&#8221;). The Company produces lease finance receivables through a specialty finance subsidiary that participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. Lease finance receivables are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased assets and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases, less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease term using the interest method. 

The standard leases are typically repayable on a level monthly basis with terms ranging from 24 to 120 months. At the end of the lease term, the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment, to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) price. For leases with a FMV renewal/purchase option, the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, including evaluation of key factors, such as, the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset, its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the FMV option, overall credit evaluation and return provisions. The Company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost, less any volume or trade discounts, as applicable. Therefore, there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease. 

The residual value component of a lease financing receivable represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. In establishing residual value estimates, the Company may rely on industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals and, where appropriate, information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades and competing products. Upon expiration of a lease, residual assets are remarketed, resulting in either an extension of the lease by the lessee, a lease to a new customer or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party. Impairment of residual values arises if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount. The Company assesses its net investment in lease financing receivables (including residual values) for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment losses recognized in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investment in lease financing receivables may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses with changes recognized as provision expense. On certain lease financings, the Company obtains residual value insurance from third parties to manage and reduce the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $ 26 million and $ 280 million, respectively. 

The Company uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of its lease financing receivables. 

The components of lease income were as follows:

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of net investment in leases, excluding purchase accounting adjustments was $ 3.0 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively. The components of net investment in direct financing leases, including the carrying amount of the lease receivables, as well as the unguaranteed residual asset were as follows:

Lessee Arrangements 

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and certain equipment. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. For the vast majority of the Company&#8217;s leases, we are not reasonably certain we will exercise our options to renew to the end of all renewal option periods. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Right of use asset assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the vast majority of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate (FHLB borrowing rate) is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. The operating lease right of use asset is measured at cost, which includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, prepaid rent and initial direct costs incurred by the Company, less incentives received. 

Variable costs such as the proportionate share of actual costs for utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred. 

The components of lease expense were as follows:

Note 9 - Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The Company has investments in mortgage servicing rights that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing. The Company accounts for mortgage servicing rights at fair value. A primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted, in part, by declining interest rates or government intervention. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. The Company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments. There is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates, which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives. For further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our mortgage servicing rights risk, see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell all of its mortgage servicing rights for an amount equal to their carrying amount at the date of the agreement. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events. 

Changes in the fair value of residential first mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") were as follows:

(1) Changes in fair value are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

(2) Represents estimated MSR value change resulting primarily from market-driven changes which we manage through the use of derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the hypothetical effect on fair value of servicing rights using adverse changes of 10 percent and 20 percent to the weighted average of certain significant assumptions used in valuing these assets: 

June 30, 2024 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.2 &#160; % $ ( 20 ) $ ( 39 ) Constant prepayment rate 7.9 &#160; % ( 40 ) ( 77 ) Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 68 &#160; $ ( 11 ) $ ( 22 ) 

December 31, 2023 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.4 &#160; % $ ( 20 ) $ ( 39 ) Constant prepayment rate 7.9 &#160; % ( 37 ) ( 71 ) Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 69 &#160; $ ( 10 ) $ ( 21 ) 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. To isolate the effect of the specified change, the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change, while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. For further information on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, see Note 16 - Fair Value Measures . 

Contractual servicing and subservicing fees, including late fees and other ancillary income are presented below. Contractual servicing fees are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Contractual subservicing fees including late fees and other ancillary income are included within loan administration income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subservicing fee income is recorded for fees earned on subserviced loans, net of third-party subservicing costs.

Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities 

We have no consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In connection with our non-qualified mortgage securitization activities, we have retained a five percent interest in the investment securities of certain trusts and are contracted as the subservicer of the underlying loans, compensated based on market rates, which constitutes a continuing involvement in these trusts. Although we have a variable interest in these securitization trusts, we are not their primary beneficiary due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the total amount of securities issued by the VIE and our inability to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance. As a result, we have not consolidated the assets and liabilities of the VIE in our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Bank&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is limited to our five percent retained interest in the investment securities that had a fair value of $ 168 million as of June 30, 2024 as well as the standard representations and warranties made in conjunction with the loan transfers.

(1) Does not included the effect of interest rate swap agreements. Represents current coupon rate; most advances are floating rate. 

FHLB advances include straight fixed-rate advances, floating rate advances and advances under the FHLB convertible advance program, which gives the FHLB the option of either calling the advance after an initial lock-out period of up to five years and quarterly thereafter until maturity, or a one-time call at the initial call date. 

Federal Reserve Advances 

The discount window borrowing with the Federal Reserve matures in September 2024, and the term funding matures in December 2024.

Note 13 - Stock-Related Benefits Plans 

Stock Based Compensation 

At June 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 14,992,035 shares (reflective of the 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected July 11, 2024) available for grants as restricted stock, options, or other forms of related rights under the 2020 Incentive Plan, which includes the remaining shares available, converted at the merger conversion factor from the legacy Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Stock Plan. The Company granted 728,711 shares of restricted stock, with an average fair value of $ 8.70 per share on the date of grant, during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Compensation and benefits expense related to the restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and totaled $ 22 million and $ 18 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost relating to unvested restricted stock totaled $ 85 million. This amount will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 2.1 years. 

Forfeitures of Restricted Stock Awards are accounted for as they occur. 

Stock Options 

On March 6, 2024 the Company granted 6,333,333 stock options ( 1,333,333 vest on March 6, 2025 and 5,000,000 vest in 12 equal quarterly installments on the final day of each quarter beginning June 30, 2024) to senior executives of the Company. These options expire on March 6, 2034. On April 25, 2024 the Company granted 3,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company; these options vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date and expire on April 25, 2031. On June 21, 2024 the Company granted 1,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company which vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. These options expire on June 21, 2031. All relevant share information related to stock options is reflective of the 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected July 11, 2024. The Company generally utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock option grants, although measurements for long-dated options are difficult due to lack of market data appropriate for the instrument lives. No stock options were forfeited during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company estimates the options granted in the six months ended June 30, 2024 to have a grant date fair-value of $ 58 million, which will be recognized in compensation expense over the vesting period.

Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposure to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and liquidity risks, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company's policy is to present our derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for set-off are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties, variation margin payments are recognized as settlements. We are exposed to non-performance risk by the counterparties to our various derivative financial instruments. A majority of our derivatives are centrally cleared through a Central Counterparty Clearing House or consist of residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments further limiting our exposure to non-performance risk. We believe that the non-performance risk inherent in our remaining derivative contracts is minimal based on credit standards and the collateral provisions of the derivative agreements. 

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company maintains a derivative portfolio of interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, futures, swaptions and forward commitments used to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and mortgage servicing right asset values and to meet the needs of customers. The Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale is managed using corresponding forward sale commitments and U.S. Treasury futures. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024 we de-designated and terminated all of our derivatives that were designated in a cash flow or fair value hedge relationship. This action was taken to reduce our asset sensitivity and bring the balance sheet to an interest rate neutral position and did not have any immediate impact to earnings. The remaining impact from the cash flow hedge relationships will be reclassified from other comprehensive income into income over the life of the hedged items. 

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments . The Company has previously designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rates-based variable interest payments on federal home loan bank advances. Changes in the fair value of derivatives previously designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $ 88 million (net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company had $ 10 million (net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2023. 

Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and qualitatively thereafter, unless regression analysis is deemed necessary. 

Fair Value of Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in interest rates. The Company previously used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involved the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives were used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed rate assets. For derivatives previously designated and that qualified as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk were recognized in interest income. The fair value basis adjustments remaining from discontinued hedges are recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the hedged items. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest income from loans and leases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income was increased by $ 8 million due to the floating rate payments received on the swaps being greater than the fixed rate payments, as well as the accretion of the fair value basis adjustment subsequent to discontinuance of the hedges. 

The fair value basis adjustment on our previously hedged real estate loans is included in loans and leases held for investment on our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The carrying amount of our hedged loans was $ 5.9 billion at June 30, 2024, of which unrealized gains of $ 31 million were due to the discontinued fair value hedge relationship.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts subject to variability caused by changes in interest rates from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $ 5.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 were designated as cash flow hedges of certain FHLB borrowings. There were no designated hedging relationships as of June 30, 2024. 

The following table presents the effect of the Company&#8217;s cash flow derivative instruments on accumulated other comprehensive loss:

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company&#8217;s variable-rate borrowings. We will recognize $ 22 million lower interest expense over the next rolling twelve month period related to the reclassification.

As of June 30, 2024 the weighted average amortization period for core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets is 8.7 years and 3.6 years, respectively. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over the estimated useful life using the sum of years digits amortization method. 

The estimated amortization expense of core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 

(in millions) Amortization Expense 2024 $ 65 &#160; 2025 107 &#160; 2026 94 &#160; 2027 81 &#160; 2028 68 &#160; Total $ 415 &#160; 

Note 16 - Fair Value Measures 

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles sets forth a definition of fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles also clarifies that fair value is an &#8220;exit&#8221; price, representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset, or paid when transferring a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is thus a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability. 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications for its assets on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another. 

A description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows: 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange-traded securities. 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would 

generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, and primarily include such instruments as mortgage-related and corporate debt securities. 

Periodically, the Company uses fair values supplied by independent pricing services to corroborate the fair values derived from the pricing models. In addition, the Company reviews the fair values supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness. The Company challenges pricing service valuations that appear to be unusual or unexpected. 

While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate, and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair values of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair values at a reporting date.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such instruments are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). The following tables present assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

(2) Represents the fair value of impaired loans, based on the value of the collateral. 

The fair values of collateral-dependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques, including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate and other market data. 

Other Fair Value Disclosures 

For the disclosure of fair value information about the Company&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, when available, quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on present-value estimates or other valuation techniques. Such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used, the timing of future cash flows, and the discount rate. 

Because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature, estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes. Furthermore, in many cases, the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of such instruments. 

The following tables summarize the carrying values, estimated fair values, and fair value measurement levels of financial instruments that were not carried at fair value on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair values for the Company&#8217;s financial instruments follow: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Securities 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

Ownership in equity securities of the FHLB is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale. The carrying amount approximates the fair value. 

Loans and leases 

The Company discloses the fair value of loans measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion. The Company determined the fair value on substantially all of its loans for disclosure purposes, on an individual loan basis. The discount rates reflect current market rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers having similar credit quality on an exit price basis. For those loans where a discounted cash flow technique was not considered reliable, the Company used a quoted market price for each individual loan. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the mortgage servicing rights are option adjusted spreads, prepayment rates and cost to service. Significant increases (decreases) in all three assumptions in isolation result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Weighted average life (in years) is used to determine the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights. For June 30, 2024, the weighted average life (in years) for the entire portfolio was 7.09 . 

Rate lock commitments 

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e. the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

Deposits 

The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., interest-bearing checking and money market accounts, savings accounts, and non-interest-bearing accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. These estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships, which comprise a portion of the Company&#8217;s deposit base. 

Borrowed Funds 

The estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 

The fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions, considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers. The estimated fair values of such off-balance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Fair Value Option 

We elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to more closely align the accounting method with the underlying economic exposure. Interest income on loans held for sale is accrued on the principal outstanding primarily using the "simple-interest" method. 

The following table reflects the change in fair value included in earnings of financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected:

Series A Preferred stock 

Each Series A preferred depositary share represents 1/40th interest in a share of the Company&#8217;s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $ 1000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depositary share). Dividends accrue on the shares at a fixed rate equal to 6.375 percent per annum until March 17, 2027, and a floating rate equal to three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 408.26 basis points per annum beginning on March 17, 2027. Dividends will be payable in arrears on March 17, June 17, September 17, and December 17 of each year, which commenced on June 17, 2017. In the second quarter of 2024, we paid dividends on our Series A preferred stock of $ 15.94 per share. 

Series B Preferred Stock 

As of June 30, 2024, each share of Series B Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;) was automatically convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock (or one share of Series C Preferred Stock in limited circumstances) in the event of a transfer consistent with the rules and limitations of Regulation Y (a "Reg Y Transfer"). As of June 30, 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented the right (on an as converted basis) to receive approximately 64 million shares of our common stock. Series B Preferred Stock shareholders do not have voting rights, except in limited circumstances. 

On June 5, 2024, shareholders approved (a) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 300,000,000 to 666,666,666 ; and (b) the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the March 2024 capital raise pursuant to New York Stock Exchange listing rules (the &#8220;Stockholder Approvals&#8221;). In accordance with the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations, upon obtaining the Stockholder Approvals, the quarterly non-cumulative cash dividend (annual rate of 13 percent) and liquidation preference rights ceased to apply. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock (a) are now entitled to receive dividends at the same time and on the same terms as the holders of common stock, including for the dividend declared and paid by the Company on June 17, 2024, and (b) rank as equal to the Common Stock in any liquidation of the Company. 

The Series B Preferred Stock is classified in mezzanine equity as it is contingently convertible into shares of preferred stock that are redeemable for cash, contingent on events that are not solely in the control of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock is not remeasured because it is currently not probable that it will become redeemable. 

Series C Preferred Stock 

All of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Series C Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series C Preferred Stock&#8221;) have converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series C Certificate of Designation as of June 30, 2024. 

Warrants 

Warrants to purchase shares of a new class of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Series D NVCE Stock") for an initial exercise price of $ 2,500 per share were issued in conjunction with the March 2024 capital raise. The warrants are not exercisable until September 10, 2024 and expire 7 years after issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, as a result of the dividend paid on shares of our common stock on June 17, 2024, the exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $ 2,492 . The terms of the Warrants prescribe net settlement in shares. All the Warrants issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 entitled the holders thereof to receive 315,000 shares of Series D NVCE Stock (subject to net settlement of shares). As of June 30, 2024, no shares of Series D Non-Voting Common Equivalent Stock of the Company (&#8220;Series D NVCE Stock&#8221;) have been issued. Shares of Series D NVCE Stock are issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant. 

Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies 

Pledged Assets 

The Company pledges securities to serve as collateral for its repurchase agreements and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings, among other purposes. We had pledged investment securities of $ 9.4 billion and $ 2.8 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had $ 55.9 billion and $ 43.1 billion of loans pledged between the FHLB-NY and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window to serve as collateral for its wholesale borrowings at the respective period-ends. 

Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit 

In the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding which are not included on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The majority of the outstanding loan commitments were expected to close within 90 days. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet commitments to originate loans and letters of credit: 

(in millions) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Multi-family and commercial real estate $ 33 &#160; $ 52 &#160; One-to-four family including interest rate locks 3,133 &#160; 1,694 &#160; Acquisition, development, and construction 3,227 &#160; 3,926 &#160; Warehouse loan commitments 4,770 &#160; 7,074 &#160; Other loan commitments 10,736 &#160; 11,315 &#160; Total loan commitments $ 21,899 &#160; $ 24,061 &#160; Commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit 814 &#160; 915 &#160; Total commitments $ 22,713 &#160; $ 24,976 &#160; 

Financial Guarantees 

The Company provides guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enable them to complete a variety of business transactions and to enhance their credit standings. These guarantees are recorded at their respective fair values in &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company considers the fair value of the guarantees to equal the consideration received. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s guarantees and indemnifications at June 30, 2024: 

(in millions) Maximum Potential Amount of Future Payments Financial stand-by letters of credit $ 631 &#160; Performance stand-by letters of credit 26 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 157 &#160; Total letters of credit $ 814 &#160; 

The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could be funded under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties or if indemnification provisions were triggered, as applicable, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. 

The Company collects fees upon the issuance of commercial and stand-by letters of credit. Stand-by letters of credit fees are initially recorded by the Company as a liability and are recognized as income periodically through the respective expiration dates. Fees for commercial letters of credit are collected and recognized as income at the time that they are issued and upon payment of each set of documents presented. In addition, the Company requires adequate collateral, typically in the form of cash, real property, and/or personal guarantees upon its issuance of irrevocable stand-by letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit are primarily secured by the goods being purchased in the underlying transaction and are also personally guaranteed by the owner(s) of the applicant company. 

At June 30, 2024, the Company had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Legal Proceedings 

The Company is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business, including stockholder class and derivative actions. The outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of investigations or any other matters before regulatory agencies is uncertain, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, including with respect to any litigation, investigation or other regulatory actions related to (i) the business practices of acquired companies, including our recent acquisition of Flagstar and the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of Signature, (ii) the capital raise transaction we completed in March of 2024, (iii) the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed 

in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, (iv) past cyber security breaches, and (v) recent events and circumstances involving the Company, including our full year 2023 earnings announcement, disclosures regarding credit losses, provisioning and goodwill impairment, and negative news and expectations about the prospects of the Company (and associated stock price volatility and changes). 

There can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, penalties, costs and/or expenses as a result of such litigation, (ii) that the reserves we have established will be sufficient to cover such losses, or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed such reserves and have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company may incur significant legal expenses in defending the litigation described above during the pendency of these matters, and in connection with any other potential cases, including expenses for the potential reimbursement of legal fees of officers and directors under indemnification obligations. 

Note 19 - Subsequent Events 

On July 11, 2024, a previously announced reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-3 took effect. On the effective date, every three shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held by the Company in treasury were combined into one issued share of common stock. In addition, the aggregate number of equity-based awards that remain available to be granted under the Company&#8217;s equity compensation plans was decreased proportionately and proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price, share-based vesting criteria and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares that would be owned upon vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and other equity-based awards, as applicable. The impact of the reverse stock split on the Company's preferred stock and warrants is discussed within Note 17 - Mezzanine and Stockholders' Equity. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. In accordance with ASC 260-10-55-12, the Company has adjusted the number of shares, per-share computations and the computations of basic and diluted EPS retroactively for all periods presented in the financial statements and related notes. 

On July 22, 2024 the Company announced that it had closed on the sale of approximately $ 6 billion of mortgage warehouse loans to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Company expects to close on an additional $ 200 million of mortgage warehouse loans in the near future, once necessary customer approvals are received. We expect to recognize certain expenses associated with the mortgage warehouse sale in the third quarter. 

On July 25, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential mortgage servicing business, including mortgage servicing rights and third-party origination platform, to Mr. Cooper, a leading mortgage originator and servicer, for approximately $ 1.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024.
