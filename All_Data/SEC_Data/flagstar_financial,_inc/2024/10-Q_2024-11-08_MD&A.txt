 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Background 

Flagstar Financial, Inc. is a bank holding company (collectively with its subsidiaries the &#8220;Company&#8221;) whose principal operation is its subsidiary Flagstar Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company has experienced a number of events in the last 22 months that have significantly impacted its balance sheet, results of operations, credit losses, liquidity and funding, and regulatory capital. At the end of 2022, the Company acquired and merged with Flagstar Bancorp Inc. ("Flagstar Bancorp") which increased assets by $26 billion and liabilities by $24 billion. In March 2023 the Company acquired $38 billion of assets and assumed $36 billion of liabilities from the FDIC related to the former Signature Bridge Bank. These transactions resulted in the Company exceeding $100 billion in total assets which results in being categorized as a Category IV institution for regulatory purposes, increasing requirements and expectations related to liquidity, risk management and governance. Refer to Regulatory Capital and Requirements of Category IV Standards for additional information. Effective October 25, 2024 the Company&#8217;s name changed to Flagstar Financial, Inc. from New York Community Bancorp, Inc. 

Beginning in late 2023, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio began to experience stress, related principally to vacancy-driven declines in the office sector, and inflation and high interest rates in the multi-family sector, particularly for the sub-set of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio comprised of majority rent-regulated collateral, a portion of which is impacted by a 2019 New York State law change. Concerns about the impact of these portfolio stresses led to significant declines in the Company&#8217;s stock price and customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter 2024. In response to these declines, the Company raised $1.05 billion in equity capital in March 2024 through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock and preferred stock convertible to common stock, and raised liquidity through brokered deposits and wholesale funding. The result of these events and conditions has led to a significantly lower net interest margin and higher loan loss provisions in 2024. Subsequent to the March 2024 capital raise, the Company&#8217;s customer deposit base stabilized, and grew substantially in the second and third quarters of 2024 as a result of private banking customers returning deposits to the Bank and through promotional programs for retail customers. 

To further simplify the Company&#8217;s operations, reduce operational risk, and begin transitioning to a more diversified regional bank, as well as enhance its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity, in the third quarter 2024 the (i) Company completed the sale of its warehouse lending portfolio (approximately $6 billion in assets) and (ii) entered into a definitive agreement to sell its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities, which sale was completed on October 31, 2024. The warehouse lending sale provided significant increased liquidity, which allowed us to repay wholesale borrowings late in the third quarter of 2024. It also increased the Company's capital ratios approximately 70 basis points. We estimate the mortgage sale transaction will further increase the Company&#8217;s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 60 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company expects to incur impairment and severance charges during the fourth quarter 2024 related to the sale. These transactions will decrease interest income and fee income until the resulting capital has been redeployed by the Company in lending and investing activities. These decreases will be partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with the activities being sold. 

Results of Operations 

The Company reported a third quarter 2024 net loss of $280 million compared to a net loss of $323 million for the second quarter 2024. The net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter 2024 was $289 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $333 million, or $1.14 per diluted share for the second quarter 2024. Included in the third quarter 2024 results are $37 million of merger-related expenses and certain items related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse business in July 2024, which aggregates to $0.10 per diluted share. Included in the second quarter 2024 results are $25 million of merger-related expenses or $0.09 per diluted share. 

During the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $930 million compared to net income of $2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 was $957 million or $3.16 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023 or $10.84 per diluted share. Included in the results for the first nine months of 2024 are a $121 million reduction in the bargain purchase gain arising from the Signature transaction, $94 million of merger-related expenses, and certain items related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse business in July 2024, which aggregate to $0.71 per diluted share. Included in the results for the first nine months of 2023 are a bargain purchase gain of $2.1 billion arising from the Signature transaction and $198 million of merger-related expenses, which aggregate to $8.10 per diluted share. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. The amount of our net interest income is a function of the amount of interest-earning assets we hold, the manner in which we fund these assets, including interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the interest rates we earn on assets and the interest rates we pay on liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee, and market interest rates. 

Our interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of customer deposits and funds we borrow. The average term of our fixed rate deposits is less than twelve months, therefore the cost of our deposits and most of our borrowed funds is largely based on short-term rates of interest, the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee. The yields on our held-for-investment loans, and the majority of our cash balances, reset based on short-term market rates. However, a sizable portion of our held-for-investment loans have fixed rates and generally reset to intermediate-term market rates when they reach repricing dates. 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our net interest income and average balance sheet for the periods indicated. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the periods are derived from average balances that are calculated daily.

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

The net interest margin for the third quarter 2024 was 1.79 percent, down 19 basis points compared to the second quarter 2024 and down 148 basis points compared to the third quarter 2023. The 19 basis points reduction compared to the second quarter 2024 was the result of a 22 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 4.37 percent. This is coupled with continued deposit growth of $4.0 billion, or a 7 percent increase, in average interest-bearing deposits to $63.6 billion. Additionally, we carried higher cash balances from the sale of the warehouse portfolio prior to paying down debt at the end of the quarter. The average cost of borrowed funds remained unchanged at 5.28 percent. 

A substantial portion of our commercial real estate loan portfolio has a fixed rate through the repricing date, which can extend several years. Because most of these loans were originated when market rates were lower than present rates, they have a negative impact to our net interest margin. However, upon reaching repricing option dates, the resulting rate resets will increase our interest income if higher interest rates persist. See "Loan Maturity and Repricing" below. Other factors affecting the amount of our net interest income for the third quarter 2024 include a $0.6 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

During the first nine months of 2024, the net interest margin was 2.01 percent, down 104 basis points compared to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily from the impact of customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter 2024 and the resulting shift in deposit mix to the promotional high-yield savings product, short-term certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings. 

Other factors affecting net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 include: 

&#8226; A $2.3 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 

&#8226; A $9.4 billion increase in cash and investment securities driven by our actions to increase on-balance sheet liquidity and the sale of our warehouse portfolio in July 2024. 

&#8226; An increase in the average loan yield primarily due to the impact of multi-family loans repricing to higher rates upon reaching the end of their initial fixed rate periods. 

&#8226; A 48 basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities driven by lower rate securities maturing and being replaced with higher rate securities, consistent with the increase in market interest rates. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the third quarter 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $242 million compared to a $390 million provision for the second quarter 2024. The provision reflects lower charge-offs for the third quarter 2024, principally as a result of fewer larger-balance office property downgrades and charge-offs as a large portion of that portfolio was reviewed in the first and second quarters of 2024. The Company&#8217;s multi-family portfolio continues to be impacted by market conditions as higher interest rates and inflationary impacts of the previous two years persist. The Company expects continued elevated charge-offs as additional loans near their re-pricing dates and appraisals are received on those properties. 

Net charge-offs totaled $240 million for third quarter 2024, compared to $349 million for second quarter 2024. Net charge-offs on a non-annualized basis represented 0.31 percent of average loans outstanding during the third quarter 2024 compared to 0.42 percent of average loans outstanding during the second quarter 2024. Included in the third quarter net charge-offs was approximately $45 million of charge-offs taken on non-accrual loans that were moved to held for sale at the agreed-upon selling price. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first nine months of 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $947 million compared to a $281 million provision for the first nine months of 2023. The provision reflects substantial increases in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and charge-offs during the current period, principally related to risk rating downgrades on commercial real estate and multi-family loans with upcoming maturities or repricing for which the estimated property net operating income would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms, as well as underlying collateral value declines principally in the office portfolio. 

Net charge-offs totaled $670 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $23 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by an increase in nonaccrual loans in the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolios and underlying collateral value declines. 

Non-Interest Income 

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods: 

Three Months Ended, Nine Months Ended, (in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Fee income $ 42 $ 41 $ 117 $ 133 Net return on mortgage servicing rights 34 19 74 70 Bank-owned life insurance 10 12 32 32 Net gain on loan sales and securitizations 5 18 43 73 Net (loss) gain on securities &#8212; $ &#8212; &#8212; (1)

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

In the third quarter 2024, non-interest income totaled $113 million compared to $114 million in the second quarter 2024. Net gain on loan sales and securitizations declined $13 million, driven by $23 million in selling costs related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio. This was offset by a $15 million increase in the net return on mortgage servicing rights. The slightly higher loss on net loan administration was due to higher interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits. 

As a result of the Company&#8217;s October 31, 2024 sale of its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities, substantially all income associated with servicing rights, gain on loan sales, and loan administration income ceased upon the transaction close. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first nine months of 2024, non-interest income totaled $236 million compared to $2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the impact due to the bargain purchase gain related to the Signature transaction, noninterest income decreased $61 million. Net loan administration income totaled $3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $65 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in subservicing income from short-term services provided as a result of the Signature transaction. Net gain on loan sales and securitizations declined $30 million driven by $23 million of selling costs related to the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio in 2024. Other noninterest income increased $42 million driven by higher commercial loan and investment product fee income, which was partially offset by a $16 million reduction in fee income driven by lower retail deposit transaction fees. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The following table summarizes our non-interest expense for the respective periods: 

Three Months Ended, Nine Months Ended, (in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits $ 316 $ 312 $ 961 $ 854 FDIC insurance 98 91 239 56 Occupancy and equipment 59 52 163 142 General and administrative 188 183 557 440 Total operating expense 661 638 1,920 1,492 Intangible asset amortization 37 33 105 90 Merger-related and restructuring expenses 18 34 95 267 Total non-interest expense $ 716 $ 705 $ 2,120 $ 1,849 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

Total non-interest expenses were $716 million, up $11 million or 2 percent compared to the second quarter 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a $7 million or 8 percent increase in FDIC insurance expense due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans and other factors affecting the assessment rate. 

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we have taken actions to reduce operating expenses through headcount and other cost reductions. While we expect our costs related to improvements in our risk infrastructure and expansion of commercial banking business will increase, we currently expect our overall level of non-interest expense to decrease in 2025. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Total non-interest expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $2.1 billion, up $271 million or 15 percent compared to the first nine months of 2023. This increase was driven primarily by a $183 million increase in FDIC insurance expense due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans, sequential four-quarter loss position and other factors affecting the assessment rate. The nine month period ended September 30, 2024 also includes the full impact of the Signature transaction that closed in March 2023, including an increase in the number of employees, higher occupancy costs related to an increase in the number of Company locations, and the higher regulatory costs described previously. 

Income Tax Expense 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the third quarter 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $55 million compared to a benefit of $101 million for the second quarter 2024. The effective tax rate for the third quarter 2024 was 16.34 percent compared to 23.69 percent for the second quarter 2024. The income tax benefit for the third quarter 2024 was lower than the second quarter 2024, primarily due to a lower book loss, primarily attributable to the lower provision for credit losses. Certain non-deductible items impacted the Company's effective tax rate, including the FDIC insurance expense and the bargain purchase gain adjustment. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $210 million compared to an income tax expense of $141 million for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 18.40 percent compared to 5.09 percent in the first nine months of 2023. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 is largely due to the tax impact of the Signature transaction being recorded as a reduction to the bargain gain and not included in income tax provision, consistent with purchase accounting requirements. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Balance Sheet Summary 

Total assets increased $0.3 billion to $114.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $114.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The Company increased on-balance sheet liquidity in cash and cash equivalents by $11.6 billion, which was offset by reductions in balances of loans held for investment, as discussed further below. 

Total loans and leases held for investment decreased $13.5 billion to $71.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $84.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio in the third quarter, along with reductions in commercial and industrial loans where we made strategic decisions to decrease the size of some of our lending positions and exit certain non-relationship-based customers. In addition, our commercial real estate and multi-family portfolios continue to decline as borrowers pay off their loans and we work to strategically reduce the concentration of these portfolios. 

The securities portfolio increased $1.4 billion to $10.5 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Our securities portfolio is classified as available-for-sale with low credit risk U.S. government agency bonds comprising over 90 percent of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These instruments are recorded at fair value and interest rate driven unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Total deposits increased $1.5 billion, to $83.0 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $81.5 billion at December 31, 2023. In February and March 2024, we experienced $9.7 billion in deposit attrition following downgrades in our debt and deposit ratings by third-party credit rating agencies. On March 6, 2024 we announced a $1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized for the remainder of the first quarter 2024. In response to the customer deposit attrition, we replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through $4.1 billion in brokered certificates of deposit and $5.5 billion of wholesale borrowings. Subsequently in the second and third quarter 2024 our customer deposits increased substantially through targeted deposit gathering programs and private banking customer engagement which, along with the liquidity from the warehouse lending portfolio sale, allowed us to repay the wholesale borrowings from earlier in the year. 

Certain assets and liabilities have been classified as held-for sale related to the sale of our mortgage servicing, subservicing, third-party mortgage origination activities and our mortgage servicing rights asset as of September 30, 2024.

Multi-Family Loans 

The multi-family loan portfolio was $35.1 billion at September 30, 2024, down $2.1 billion compared to $37.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This is reflective of our continuing efforts to strategically diversify our portfolio as borrowers without a deposit relationship seek more favorable loan terms with other lenders. 

Our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period ; however, they are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including the calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower, particularly the loan-to-value of the property. At September 30, 2024, we had $14.0 billion of multi-family loans in their interest-only period. These loans were originated with an average interest-only period of approximately 36 months. A s of September 30, 2024, there is a weighted average interest-only period of approximately 20 months rem aining . Approximately 56 percent of these loans enter their amortization period by the end of 2025. 

The majority of our multi-family loans are non-recourse and are secured by rental apartment buildings. At September 30, 2024, $19.8 billion or 56 percent of the Company&#8217;s total multi-family loan portfolio was secured by properties in New York State, many of which are subject to rent regulation laws to varying degrees. The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the "Act") significantly limits the ability to increase rents on regulated apartments upon vacancy. These limitations may reduce a borrower&#8217;s ability to generate additional revenues on those units to offset higher operating expenses due to inflation and the current interest rate environment. This could result in lower net operating income and could impact a 

borrower&#8217;s ability to satisfy repayment obligations during the term of the loan. In addition, the level of income generated by the property may be insufficient to qualify for refinancing at maturity. The impact on current and future cash flows has adversely impacted the value of properties with a high concentration of rent regulated units which has increased charge-offs in 2024. 

To mitigate our exposure to rent regulated properties, we are curtailing future originations of such loans secured by rent-regulated properties. We are no longer utilizing mortgage brokers to refer loan origination opportunities to us. We are focusing originations and renewal retention on borrowers with whom we will have broader customer relationships beyond lending. Additionally, we are strategically diversifying our loan portfolio to shift from multi-family loans to other loan sectors. We have begun to add experienced commercial banking lenders and credit personnel which will impact our noninterest expense. 

We continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses, particularly 

given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multi-family markets. Although occupancy levels have historically tended to be stable due to below market rents, rent-regulated loans that are repricing are incurring debt service levels that, when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, approach or exceed some properties&#8217; net operating income and may require the borrower to support the loan from sources unrelated to the collateral until elevated interest rates subside.

Commercial Real Estate 

At September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans represented $9.2 billion, or 13.0 percent, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a $1.3 billion decrease compared to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to payoffs, as well as charge-offs and loan sales. 

Certain of our commercial real estate loans may contain an interest-only period; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower and the loan-to-value of the property. 

Substantially all commercial real estate loans we originate are non-recourse and are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. Occupancy levels for office space have declined substantially over the past three years which has had an impact on borrowers' 

net operating income and their ability to cover debt service. These unfavorable market conditions also lower the value of underlying collateral which has had a material impact on loan charge-offs in 2024.

Commercial and Industrial 

The commercial and industrial loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses and finance companies. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, and revolving lines of credit. 

A broad range of commercial and industrial loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of commercial and industrial loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At September 30, 2024, one-to-four family loans represented $5.2 billion, inclusive of $386 million of loans with government guarantees, or 7.4 percent of total loans held for investment, compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, non-government guaranteed loans in this portfolio had an average current FICO score of 743 and an average LTV of 51 percent. 

Other Loans 

At September 30, 2024, other loans totaled $1.8 billion and consisted primarily of home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans, including home equity loans, second mortgage loans and overdraft loans. As of September 30, 2024, loans in this portfolio had an average curre nt FICO score of 751. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent for loans originated as held for investment. Our mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. 

During the third quarter 2024, we completed the sale of our warehouse lending portfolio for approximately $6 billion. We sold the loans at par and incurred transaction costs of approximately $23 million related to the sale. 

Assets Held for Sale 

On October 31, 2024, we closed the previously announced sale of the residential mortgage servicing and sub-servicing business, the mortgage servicing rights asset and the third-party origination platform for approximately $1.3 billion in total cash consideration. This includes the sale of nearly all of the mortgage servicing rights, loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale at September 30, 2024. This transaction is expected to increase our capital ratios by approximately 60 basis points. We expect to recognize a net gain on sale in the fourth quarter 2024 of approximately $175 million. We also expect to incur costs of approximately $75 million, primarily the impairment of capitalized assets and severance costs associated with the transaction. Additionally, we expect approximately $4 billion of custodial deposits associated with our mortgage servicing activities to transfer out of the Bank over the course of the five months following the October 31, 2024 close. 

Securities 

Total securities were $10.5 billion, or 9 percent of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to $9.2 billion, or 8 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our securities were designated as &#8220;Available-for-Sale&#8221;. At September 30, 2024, 20 percent of our portfolio is comprised of floating rate securities. 

As of September 30, 2024, the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of tax, was $468 million, compared to $581 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting changes in market interest rates. 

At September 30, 2024, available-for-sale securities had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Included in the quarter-end amount were mortgage-related securities of $8.5 billion and other debt securities of $2.0 billion . 

At the prior year-end, available-for-sale securities were $9.2 billion and had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Mortgage-related securities accounted for $6.6 billion of the year-end balance, with other debt securities accounting for the remaining $2.6 billion.

Borrowed Funds 

The majority of our borrowed funds consist of secured wholesale borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, Discount Window loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRB"), and repurchase agreements. We also have outstanding unsecured borrowings consisting of junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At September 30, 2024, total borrowed funds decreased $8.6 billion to $20.3 billion from $28.9 billion at June 30, 2024, and $0.9 billion from December 31, 2023. The linked quarter decrease was a result of deploying liquidity from the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio and increased customer deposits to pay down debt. We expect to further decrease wholesale borrowings in the fourth quarter 2024 by approximately $2 billion. 

Wholesale Borrowings 

Wholesale borrowings at September 30, 2024 were $19.3 billion compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 

FHLB advances decreased to $18.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from $19.3 billion at December 31, 2023. FHLB advances are secured by eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities, under blanket collateral agreements with the FHLB. $250 million of our wholesale borrowings had callable features at September 30, 2024 and $2.0 billion had callable features at December 31, 2023. In the first quarter 2024, we increased our borrowing from the FHLB. In the third quarter 2024, the Company repaid over $4.5 billion of FHLB advances. We reclassified $5 million to interest expense from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter 2024 related to previously terminated hedges of forecasted cash flows associated with the repaid advances. 

In the third quarter 2024, the Company also repaid $4 billion it had drawn from the FRB discount window early in the second quarter 2024, with available liquidity from customer deposit growth and the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio. The Company had $1.0 billion drawn under the Bank Term Funding Program in 2023 that remained outstanding at September 30, 2024, scheduled to mature in December 2024. The Company repaid this advance in October 2024. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 

Repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 were $60 million. We did not have any repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2023 . These agreements primarily U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprise ("GSE") obligations as collateral and were entered into with either the FHLB or specific brokerage firms, in large part to ensure operational readiness of securities collateralized borrowing as a source of readily available funding. 

See Note 11, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings, our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt. 

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had $816 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $861 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. The Company maintains an investment in FHLB stock partly in conjunction with its membership in the FHLB and partly related to its access to the FHLB funding it utilizes. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $219 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, at cost. 

Credit Risk 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent as described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Credit Quality 

It is our practice to continually review the risk in our loan portfolio. The Company receives financial information from borrowers annually, and most of the financial information is received in the second calendar quarter. Upon receipt of updated borrower financial information, we perform an analysis to determine whether the cash flow from the underlying collateral is sufficient to meet the contractual loan payments, commonly referred to as the debt service coverage ratio. We consider the ability to cover debt service based upon the current contractual rate, or where a borrower&#8217;s initial fixed rate period expires within 18 months, the lowest contractual rate reset option available under the loan terms using the current level for referenced indices. Loans for which the collateral does not have a debt service coverage ratio of 1.0 or higher under this analysis are rated substandard. We order appraisals for all substandard loans. Where an appraisal, net of estimated selling costs, does not support recovery of the loan carrying amount for collateral-dependent loans, we classify the loan as non-accrual, regardless of payment status, and charge the loan down to its recoverable amount. Once an appraisal is ordered it takes approximately two to three months to receive and appropriately review the results. All substandard loans, including non-accrual loans, are reappraised annually and evaluated to determine if an adjustment to the carrying amount is required. Loans that are on non-accrual and, separately, the largest substandard loans are reported and reviewed with the Risk Assessment Committee at least quarterly. 

In the first nine months of 2024, $2.1 billion of multi-family loans reached their repricing date. Approximately one-third of these loans paid off, and over 80 percent of the remaining loans are current on their contractual payments at September 30, 2024. 

Classified loans increased $1.2 billion to $11.4 billion in t he third quarter 2024, from $10.2 billion in the second quarter 2024 . These downgrades were principally related to loans with upcoming maturities or repricing where the estimated net operating income of the property would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms. Classified loans reflect the potential that a loss may occur if deficiencies in the primary source of repayment are unable to be corrected and borrowers are unwilling or unable to otherwise support the loans. Refer to Note 6 - Loans and Leases in Item 1, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional details. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

A loan generally is classified as a &#8220;non-accrual&#8221; loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because there is significant uncertainty about whether we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement (principal and interest). When a loan is in non-accrual, we cease recording interest income on the loan, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income, and any subsequent interest collected is recorded as a reduction in the loan carrying amount. A loan is returned to accrual status only when the loan is current (minimum of six months of payment performance) and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible as to all contractual principal and interest. At September 30, 2024, $1.7 billion, or approximately 68 percent, of non-accrual loans were current based on their existing payment terms. 

In accordance with our charge-off policy, collateral-dependent loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in 

repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to support these efforts. Charge-offs o f $599 million w ere recorded on commercial real estate and multi-family loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily driven by appraisals received on those loans. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all substandard and non-accrual loans that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, commercial real estate properties, or land, if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered at least annually until such time as the loan becomes pass rated. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans that are not showing signs of credit weakness. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan, or when we determine an updated appraisal is needed as a result of our ongoing credit analysis. We evaluate loans that were previously placed on non-accrual at least quarterly to determine if additional charge-offs may be needed. 

Properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as other real estate owned before foreclosure and to re-appraise the properties on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s condition.

(1) Includes home equity, consumer and other loans. 

(2) Excludes $189 million of non-accrual held for sale loans. 

During the first nine months of 2024, the Company received updated financial information for a substantial portion of the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolio. Additionally a substantial number of appraisals on loans exhibiting credit weakness were received, which resulted in an increase in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2023. Approximately 68 percent of our non-accrual loans are current on their contractual payment terms. In determining whether to place a loan on non-accrual we have considered whether a borrower will be able to service its debt under terms expected within the next 18 months based on current collateral and net operating income. Where net operating income is below the projected debt service and the collateral value is below the loan amount, we place loans on non-accrual. Updated financial information from borrowers and appraisals received have led to an increase in non-accruals loans in 2024.

At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases was $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, up $272 million. Market interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next 18 months. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 

Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates various economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for rent-regulated multi-family loans. We have also considered our recent appraisal experience and the valuation risk present in loans with outstanding appraisals in estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to 1.78 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2023. Excluding loans with government guarantees and warehouse loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.80 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2023.

Liquidity Risk 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

We monitor our liquidity daily, and reporting to management and the Board occurs more frequently during times of stress. Our most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid investment securities classified as available-for-s. Additional liquidity stems from deposits, wholesale funding sources (including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits) and approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the FHLB. These funding sources depend on the amount of mortgage loan collateral and available securities pledged. The Bank also has agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank to access the discount window, pledging certain loans and securities as collateral. 

The following table summarizes our total liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources: 

(in billions)

Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity 

30.2 17.8 FHLB Available Capacity 2.9 8.4 Discount Window Available Capacity 8.3 1.7 Total Liquidity $ 41.4 $ 27.9 

At September 30, 2024, our total liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, high-quality liquid assets and borrowing capacity), was $41.4 billion. The $11.6 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by actions to further bolster our on-balance sheet liquidity levels required of Category IV banks. Our FHLB available capacity is currently limited to overnight funding requests. 

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms. The majority of our deposits are retail in nature (i.e., they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or retail deposits acquired through business combinations); however, we also utilize brokered deposits depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources. From December 31, 2023 to March 7, 2024, we experienced $9.7 billion in core deposit attrition following the credit rating agency downgrades of our Company's credit and deposit ratings in February and March 2024. On March 6, 2024, we announced a $1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized. We replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through brokered certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings in the first quarter of 2024. Subsequently, in the second and third quarters of 2024, targeted deposit gathering programs and customer engagement increased customer deposits over $7 billion. 

The following table presents the composition of the Company's brokered deposits: 

(in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Brokered money market accounts $ 112 $ 1,258 Brokered interest-bearing checking accounts represented 966 1,599

(1) Includes brokered certificate of deposit accounts of $11,559 million and $6,201 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, each of which includes all funds gathered from a single issuance. While each brokered certificate of deposit account has balances in excess of $250,000, the funds are fully insured by the FDIC as each of the ultimate owners of the funds maintain balances below FDIC insurance limits. 

The following table indicates the amount of custodial deposits by source:

Non-servicing custodial deposits 

5.1 3.7 $ 9.2 $ 6.6 

Uninsured Deposits 

We manage our liquidity to ensure our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. As a result, we have total liquidity of $41.4 billion, which exceeds the balance of our uninsured deposits by $24.8 billion. Our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000). These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts. 

At September 30, 2024, our deposit base includes $16.6 billion of uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits decreased following our earnings announcement in January 2024 and subsequent credit rating agency downgrades of our credit ratings in February and March 2024. 

Credit Ratings 

We maintain credit ratings from three rating agencies: Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS. As of each of the dates indicated, our credit ratings were as follows: 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 

Long-Term Issuer Rating: 

Moody's 

B2 Baa3 Baa3 Fitch 

BB BBB BBB Morningstar DBRS 

BBB (low) BBB (high) BBB (high) 

Short-Term Deposits Rating: 

Moody's 

NP P-2 P-2 

The primary mortgage loan agencies maintain standards that define the criteria that must be met for an institution to qualify as an eligible custodial depository for the deposits related to loans owned by those entities, including have an investment grade short-term issuer/deposit rating from Moody&#8217;s or S&#38;P. We are currently not in compliance with that criteria. We have received a waiver of these criteria for all of our custodial deposits which could be revoked at any of the agencies' discretion. We have no other direct contractual relationships tied to further downgrades in our credit ratings, but may suffer reputational risk that could have an adverse effect on our business should that occur. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer certificates of deposit with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had certificates of deposit of $29.3 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of $14.3 billion. 

We also are obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our back-office responsibilities. These obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition in other liabilities and totaled $484 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $38 million compared to $446 million at December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by and financial stand-by letters of credit. These commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 

Based upon our current cash and cash equivalent balance of $23.1 billion and our total liquidity position of $41.4 billion, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 

For the third quarter 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At September 30, 2024, the Parent Company held cash and cash equivalents of $613 million. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our common and preferred stockholders. 

Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would currently require the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to declare dividends. We have reduced our quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders to $0.01 per common share and we do not anticipate material dividends from the Bank to the Parent Company until the Bank is able to achieve a return to repeatable operating income. 

At September 30, 2024, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations through 2028. 

Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility, which represents our primary market risk. Changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Board of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may, in turn, be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic 

variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The estimated percentage change in EVE, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayment rates, current market value spreads, and deposit decay rates and betas. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2024, the following table sets forth our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) Estimated Percentage Change in Economic Value of Equity -200 shock 3.1% -100 shock 2.0% +100 shock (3.4)% +200 shock (6.1)% &#160; 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

While the EVE analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

Interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income ("NII") simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios. Modeling changes in NII requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NII analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2024, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted , and the current balance sheet mix : 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) (1) 

Estimated Percentage Change in Future Net Interest Income -200 shock (3.1)% -100 shock (1.4)% +100 shock 0.6% +200 shock 0.7% 

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged. 

The net changes in NII presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our EVE, and/or NII simulations. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would inform the Board of Directors and undertake actions to remediate, generally through capital market transactions. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#8226; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#8226; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#8226; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#8226; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

A t September 30, 2024, the estimated change in net interest income over the next twelve months for a 100 basis point reduction in short term interest rates with no change in long term interest rates is -0.20 percent and the estimated change for a 100 basis point increase in short term rates is -0.6 percent. 

Regulatory Capital and Requirements of Category IV Standards 

The Company is a bank holding company subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve while the Bank is a national bank subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Effective October 1, 2023 we became subject to Category IV prudential standards which included heightened requirements related to capital, liquidity and risk management, as follows: 

&#8226; As a Category IV firm we maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors which includes analysis under various company-derived stress scenarios. The Company submitted its 2024 capital plan to the Federal Reserve as required by regulation and received written feedback on the plan and associated governance which it has begun to address as part of the capital planning activities for 2025 and subsequent periods. Category IV institutions are subject to a supervisory stress test every other year. The supervisory stress test will first be applicable to the Company in 2026. 

&#8226; Category IV institutions are required to perform liquidity stress tests that consider the potential impact of market and idiosyncratic stresses over various time horizons, and to maintain an on-balance sheet liquidity buffer at least equal to the 30-day stress horizon. The Company has developed and continues to enhance its liquidity stress capabilities. As a result of the requirement to maintain a liquidity buffer, the Company significantly increased its on balance sheet liquidity during 2024. 

&#8226; Category IV firms are required to prepare and maintain formal resolution plans for actions to be undertaken in the event of firm failure. The FDIC issued a final rule revising the resolution plan requirements effective October 1, 2024. The Company will submit its first resolution plan under the final rule in mid-2025. The Company has a program underway to develop the resolution plan and does not expect any material impact to the Company in developing the plan. 

&#8226; Under regulatory heightened standards, a risk governance framework is required to be developed and maintained to manage and control the risk-taking activities of the firm. Management has developed a written framework and is implementing the various components in an integrated fashion as underlying business processes mature. Heightened standards also require risk limits, metrics, and analytics which monitor the size and direction of key risks in the organization. The Company has established risk limits which are monitored by the Board of Directors and continues to enhance related metrics and analytics. 

The Bank is subject to the Prompt Corrective Action regulatory capital framework that establishes five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; An institution&#8217;s capital category affects various matters, including legal requirements for regulators to take prompt corrective action and the level of a bank&#8217;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weighting assets, among other factors, and the regulators have discretion to require that institutions maintain capital in excess of minimum levels. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At September 30, 2024, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following tables set forth the common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios for the Company on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, as of the dates shown: 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company: 

Risk-Based Capital September 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital $ 8,182 10.76 % $ 8,686 11.42 % $ 10,585 13.92 % $ 8,686 7.32 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,422 4.50 4,562 6.00 6,083 8.00 4,746 4.00 Excess $ 4,760 6.26 % $ 4,124 5.42 % $ 4,502 5.92 % $ 3,940 3.32 % December 31, 2023 Total capital $ 8,009 9.05 % $ 8,512 9.62 % $ 10,415 11.77 % $ 8,512 7.75 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,983 4.50 5,310 6.00 7,081 8.00 4,392 4.00 Excess $ 4,026 4.55 % $ 3,202 3.62 % $ 3,334 3.77 % $ 4,120 3.75 % 

The increase in our capital ratios from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a $1.05 billion capital investment in the first quarter 2024 and a $12.5 billion reduction in risk weighted assets as a result of our strategic decisions to exit certain non-relationship-based businesses, including the sale of our warehouse lending portfolio which closed in the third quarter 2024. At the date of the capital investment, $413 million of the capital investment was recorded in common equity, with the remainder in mezzanine equity until the associated preferred stock was converted or exchanged into common stock. In the second and third quarters 2024, substantially all of the preferred stock converted to common stock. Refer to Note 17 - Mezzanine and Stockholders' Equity for additional details. 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank: 

Risk-Based Capital September 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital $ 9,061 11.94 % $ 9,061 11.94 % $ 10,014 13.19 % $ 9,061 7.64 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,415 4.50 4,554 6.00 6,072 8.00 4,743 4.00 Excess $ 5,646 7.44 % $ 4,507 5.94 % $ 3,942 5.19 % $ 4,318 3.64 % December 31, 2023 Total capital $ 9,305 10.52 % $ 9,305 10.52 % $ 10,271 11.61 % $ 9,305 8.48 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,980 4.50 5,307 6.00 7,076 8.00 4,389 4.00 Excess $ 5,325 6.02 % $ 3,998 4.52 % $ 3,195 3.61 % $ 4,916 4.48 % 

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50 percent; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5 percent. 

On July 25, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential mortgage servicing business, including mortgage servicing rights and third-party origination platform to an operating subsidiary of Mr. Cooper, Inc., a leading mortgage originator and servicer for approximately $1.3 billion. The transaction closed on October 31, 2024 and is expected to increase the common equity tier 1 ratios by approximately 60 basis points. 

Other Recent Developments 

On November 16, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC continues to provide an updated estimate of each institution&#8217;s quarterly and total special assessment expense and while we expect this may result in an increase, we do not expect the increase to be material. The final rule calls for the FDIC to collect special assessments over eight quarterly assessment periods, We have made two payments to date, the first of which was paid in June 2024. 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to both the Company and the Bank. In general, the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for Category III and IV banking organizations with the methodology applicable to Category I and II banking organizations. In addition to calculating risk-weighted assets under the current U.S. standardized approach, the proposal introduces a new &#8220;Expanded Risk-Based Approach,&#8221; including standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models. If adopted as proposed, the Company and the Bank would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the current U.S. standardized approach and the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and lower thresholds for deductions from CET1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets, among other things. The proposal, if enacted, would have an effective date of July 1, 2025, with certain elements, such as the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital and changes in risk-weighted assets calculated under the Expanded Risk-Based Approach, having a three-year phase-in period. The proposal has not been finalized. Recent public statements suggest changes to the proposal will ultimately be made before it is finalized and the only significant provisions likely to affect the Company are those related to AOCI. We are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the Company and the Bank if adopted as proposed. 

On August 29, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require banks with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) that can be used, in the instance of a bank&#8217;s failure, to absorb losses and increase options to resolve the failed bank. Under the proposal, the required minimum amount of LTD would be the greater of 6 percent of an entity&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets, 3.5 percent of an entity&#8217;s average total consolidated assets, or 2.5 percent of an entity&#8217;s total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. Debt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum LTD requirement would need to be unsecured, have maturities greater than one year and have plain vanilla features (e.g., no structured notes or credit sensitive instruments). The proposal would further subject banks to certain &#8220;clean holding-company&#8221; requirements, such as a prohibition on entering into derivatives with external counterparties. The proposal would provide a three-year transition period with the incremental phase-in of the requirements during this period. The proposal has not been finalized. 

We identified certain material weaknesses in management's report on internal control over financial reporting included within Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our progress toward remediation as of September 30, 2024 is discussed within Item 4 of this Form 10-Q. We do not expect the operational costs to remediate these material weaknesses to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain accounting policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, are described in Item 1. These policies relate to: (a) the determination of our allowance for credit losses, (b) valuation of mortgage servicing rights and (c) the acquisition method of accounting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Organization 

Flagstar Financial, Inc. (on a stand-alone basis, the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or "we") was organized under Delaware law on July 20, 1993 and is the holding company for Flagstar Bank N.A. (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company is headquartered in Hicksville, New York with regional headquarters in Troy, Michigan. 

The Company is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is a National Association, subject to federal regulation and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 

On November 23, 1993, the Company issued its initial offering of common stock (par value: $ 0.01 per share) at a price of $ 25.00 per share ($ 2.79 per share on a split-adjusted basis, reflecting the impact of ten stock splits between 1994 and 2024). The Company has grown organically and through a series of mergers and acquisitions, culminating in its acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. ("Flagstar Bancorp"), which closed on December 1, 2022 and the Signature Transaction (as defined within Note 3 - Business Combinations) which closed on March 20, 2023. 

Flagstar Bank, N.A. currently operates 419 branches across twelve states, including strong footholds in the Northeast and Midwest and exposure to markets in the Southeast and West Coast. Flagstar Mortgage operates nationally. 

Liquidity 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand, and to meet our financial obligations. 

Basis of Presentation 

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information on the Company's accounting policies. 

The accompanying financial statements of the Company and other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements. The accompanying financial statements of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses, mortgage servicing rights and the acquisition method of accounting. 

All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company currently has certain unconsolidated subsidiaries in the form of wholly-owned statutory business trusts, which were formed to issue guaranteed capital securities. See Note 11 &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; for additional information regarding these trusts. 

When necessary, certain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation. On July 11, 2024, a previously announced reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-3 took effect. In accordance with ASC 260-10-55-12, the Company has adjusted the number of shares, per-share computations and the computations of basic and diluted EPS retroactively for all periods presented in the financial statements and related notes. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

Standard Description Effect on Financial Statements 

ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions 

This Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. 

Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2023-08, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other&#8212;Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets 

The amendments in this update require entities that hold certain crypto assets to measure such assets at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income in each reporting period, along with other presentation and disclosure matters. 

Adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Company does not hold and has no plans to hold crypto assets. 

ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements&#8212;Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements 

This Update contains amendments to the Codification that remove references to various Concepts Statements. In most instances, the references are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. 

We early adopted this ASU which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 - Computation of Earnings per Common Share 

Earnings per Common Share (Basic and Diluted) 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the same method as basic earnings per share, however, the computation reflects the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding in-the-money stock options were exercised and converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include warrants, convertible preferred stock, stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. As the average common share price was above the $ 7.50 per share exercise price (on an as-converted common stock basis) of the warrants, the corresponding 105 million common shares underlying the shares of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Series D NVCE Stock"), underlying such warrants would have been included in the dilutive share count if the Company had positive earnings for the period. Additional information regarding the conversion of preferred shares and warrants is included in Note 17 - Mezzanine and Stockholders' Equity. 

Unvested stock-based compensation awards containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends paid on the Company&#8217;s common stock are considered participating securities, and therefore are included in the two-class method for calculating earnings per share. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends on the common stock. The Company grants restricted stock to certain employees under its stock-based compensation plan. Recipients receive cash dividends during the vesting periods of these awards, including on the unvested portion of such awards. Since these dividends are non-forfeitable, the unvested awards are considered participating securities and therefore have earnings allocated to them. 

The following table reflects basic and diluted weighted average shares and net income (loss) per share giving effect to the reverse stock split as if it had been effective for all periods presented giving effect to the July 11, 2024 reverse stock split:

Note 3 - Business Combinations 

Signature Bridge Bank 

On March 20, 2023, the Company&#8217;s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), as receiver (the "FDIC Receiver") of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. (&#8220;Signature&#8221;) to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Signature (the &#8220;Signature Transaction&#8221;). Headquartered in New York, New York, Signature was a full-service commercial bank that operated 29 branches in New York, seven branches in California, two branches in North Carolina, one branch in Connecticut, and one branch in Nevada. In connection with the Signature Transaction the Bank assumed all of Signature&#8217;s branches. The Bank acquired only certain parts of Signature it believes to be financially and strategically complementary that are intended to enhance the Company&#8217;s future growth. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company was not required to make a cash payment to the FDIC on March 20, 2023 as consideration for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The final settlement process between the Company and the FDIC concluded upon the one-year anniversary of the Signature Transaction. In addition, as part of the consideration for the Signature Transaction, the Company granted the FDIC equity appreciation rights in the common stock of the Company under an equity appreciation instrument (the "Equity Appreciation Instrument"). On March 31, 2023, the Company issued 13,010,668 shares of Company common stock to the FDIC pursuant to the Equity Appreciation Instrument. On May 19, 2023, the FDIC completed the secondary offering of those shares. 

The Company has determined that the Signature Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Accordingly, the Company recorded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 20, 2023, which was subject to adjustment for up to one year after March 20, 2023 (the &#8220;Measurement Period&#8221;). The Measurement Period concluded on March 20, 2024, and the Company has finalized its review of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Under the Agreement, the Company provided certain services to the FDIC to assist the FDIC in its administration of certain assets and liabilities which were not assumed by the Company and which remain under the control of the FDIC (the &#8220;Interim Servicing&#8221;). The FDIC reimbursed the Company for costs associated with the Interim Servicing based upon an agreed upon fee which approximates the cost to provide such services. The Interim Servicing was completed in March 2024. 

The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash &#64258;ows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. 

A summary of the net assets acquired and the estimated fair value adjustments resulting in the bargain purchase gain is as follows: 

(in millions) March 20, 2023 Net assets acquired before fair value adjustments $ 2,973 &#160; Fair value adjustments: Loans ( 727 ) Core deposit and other intangibles 464 &#160; Certificates of deposit 27 &#160; Other net assets and liabilities 39 &#160; FDIC Equity Appreciation Instrument ( 85 ) Deferred tax liability ( 690 ) Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as initially reported $ 2,001 &#160; 

Adjustments related to items identified subsequent to the initial reporting period as of March 20, 2023: 

Measurement period adjustments, excluding taxes ( 134 ) Change in deferred tax liability 143 &#160; Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as adjusted $ 2,010 &#160; 

In connection with the Signature Transaction, the Company recorded a bargain purchase gain, as adjusted, of approximately $ 2.0 billion. This includes a $ 121 million reduction in the bargain purchase gain during the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to final adjustments to the fair value of assets received and liabilities assumed, including the in-transit and other shared accounts. This adjustment is included in non-interest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No adjustments have been made subsequent to the conclusion of the Measurement Period on March 20, 2024. 

The bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including cash payments received from the FDIC) over the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed and was influenced significantly by the FDIC-assisted transaction process. 

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and consideration paid in the Signature Transaction were recorded at their estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s best estimates using information available at the date of the Signature Transaction. The following table provides the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the Signature Transaction: 

(in millions) As Initially Reported Measurement Period Adjustments As Adjusted Purchase Price consideration $ 85 &#160; $ 85 &#160; Fair value of assets acquired: Cash &#38; cash equivalents 25,043 &#160; ( 142 ) 24,901 &#160; Loans held for sale 232 &#160; 232 &#160; Loans held for investment: Commercial and industrial 10,102 &#160; ( 214 ) 9,888 &#160; Commercial real estate 1,942 &#160; ( 262 ) 1,680 &#160; Consumer and other 174 &#160; ( 1 ) 173 &#160; Total loans held for investment 12,218 &#160; ( 477 ) 11,741 &#160; CDI and other intangible assets 464 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 464 &#160; Other assets 679 &#160; ( 266 ) 413 &#160; Total assets acquired 38,636 &#160; ( 885 ) 37,751 &#160; Fair value of liabilities assumed: Deposits 33,568 &#160; ( 61 ) 33,507 &#160; Other liabilities 2,982 &#160; ( 833 ) 2,149 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 36,550 &#160; ( 894 ) 35,656 &#160; Fair value of net identifiable assets 2,086 &#160; 9 &#160; 2,095 &#160; Bargain purchase gain $ 2,001 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 2,010 &#160; 

During the Measurement Period, the Company recorded adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans and leases acquired based on information received after the transaction date, and to adjust other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities for balances ultimately retained by the FDIC. The Company also recognized a net change in the deferred tax liability due to the measurement period adjustments and the secondary offering of shares completed by the FDIC. 

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, reflecting assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability. In some cases, the estimation of fair values requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. 

See Note 3 - Business Combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information regarding the Signature Transaction, including methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Unaudited Pro Forma Information &#8211; Signature Transaction 

The Company&#8217;s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Signature subsequent to the acquisition on March 20, 2023. Due to the use of multiple systems and integration of the operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former Signature operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition. 

Signature was only in operation from March 12, 2023 to March 20, 2023 and does not have historical financial information on which we could base pro forma information. Additionally, we did not acquire all assets or assume all liabilities 

of Signature and the historical operations are not consistent with the transaction. Therefore, it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the Signature Transaction in accordance with ASC 805-10-50-2.

The investment securities having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at September 30, 2024 consisted of two hundred twenty-two agency collateralized mortgage obligations, five capital trusts notes, five asset-backed securities, twelve corporate bonds, thirty-three US government agency bonds, three hundred twenty-eight mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, one municipal bond, two private collateralized mortgage obligations and one foreign note. The investment securities designated as having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at December 31, 2023 consisted of eighty-four agency collateralized mortgage obligations, six capital trusts notes, eight asset-backed securities, twelve corporate bonds, thirty-seven US government agency bonds, three hundred two mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, one foreign debt and one municipal bond. 

The Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions at least quarterly to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required. We also assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither of these criteria are met, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount 

that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

None of the remaining unrealized losses identified as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuers&#8217; ability to honor redemption obligations. Rather, the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 

Note 6 - Loans and Leases 

The Company classifies loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity as loans held for investment. We report loans held for investment loans at their amortized cost, which includes the outstanding principal balance adjusted for any unamortized premiums, discounts, deferred fees and unamortized fair value adjustments for acquired loans:

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 totaled $ 1.9 billion, up from $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. 

We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent about holding for investment. Mortgage loans held for sale for which, we have elected the fair value option are carried at fair value. Loans originally held for investment that we have changed our intent and plan to sell are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral.

Asset Quality 

All asset quality information excludes loans with government guarantees that are insured by U.S. government agencies. A s of September 30, 2024, these loans totaled $ 386 million. 

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases recording interest income, and previously accrued interest is reversed against interest income. A loan is only returned to accrual status when the loan is current (typically a minimum of six months of payment performance) and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest received on non-accrual loans is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had no loans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing.

The classifications in the preceding tables are the most currently available and generally have been updated within the last twelve months. In addition, they follow regulatory guidelines and can generally be described as follows: pass loans are of satisfactory quality; special mention loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention; substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged (these loans have a well-defined weakness and there is a possibility that the Company will sustain some loss); and non-accrual loans, which based on existing circumstances, have weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. One-to-four family loans are classified based on the duration of the delinquency. 

When management determines that foreclosure is probable for loans that are individually evaluated, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral adjusted for selling costs. When the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the collateral-dependent practical expedient has been elected and expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. For commercial real estate loans, collateral properties include office buildings, warehouse/distribution buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings, residential and commercial tract development. The primary source of repayment on these loans is expected to come from the sale, permanent financing or lease of the real property collateral. Commercial real estate loans are impacted by fluctuations in collateral values, as well as the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing. 

The following table summarizes the recorded investment of the Company&#8217;s collateral-dependent loans held for investment by collateral type as of September 30, 2024:

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 57 million and $ 81 million of residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure, respectively. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

When borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty, the Company may make certain loan modifications as part of loss mitigation strategies to maximize expected payment. Modifications in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension that have occurred in the current reporting period to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are disclosed along with the financial impact of the modifications.

At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases was $ 1.3 billion compared to $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, up $ 272 million. Interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next 18 months. Although the short-term interest rate reduction announced by the Federal Reserve during the third quarter 2024 does alleviate some pressure on our borrowers, rates remain high and uncertainty remains for future potential rate reductions. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 

Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for multi-family loans and, most notably, rent-regulated multi-family loans. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $ 64 million and $ 52 million, respectively. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to 1.78 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2023.

Note 8 - Leases 

Lessor Arrangements 

The Company is a lessor in the equipment finance business where it has executed direct financing leases (&#8220;lease finance receivables&#8221;). The Company produces lease finance receivables through a specialty finance subsidiary that participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. Lease finance receivables are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased assets and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases, less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease term using the interest method. 

The standard leases are typically repayable on a level monthly basis with terms ranging from 24 to 120 months. At the end of the lease term, the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment, to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) price. For leases with a FMV renewal/purchase option, the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, including evaluation of key factors, such as, the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset, its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the FMV option, overall credit evaluation and return provisions. The Company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost, less any volume or trade discounts, as applicable. Therefore, there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease. 

The residual value component of a lease financing receivable represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. In establishing residual value estimates, the Company may rely on industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals and, where appropriate, information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades and competing products. Upon expiration of a lease, residual assets are remarketed, resulting in either an extension of the lease by the lessee, a lease to a new customer or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party. Impairment of residual values arises if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount. The Company assesses its net investment in lease financing receivables (including residual values) for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment losses recognized in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investment in lease financing receivables may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses with changes recognized as provision expense. On certain lease financings, the Company obtains residual value insurance from third parties to manage and reduce the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $ 17 million and $ 280 million, respectively. 

The Company uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of its lease financing receivables. 

The components of lease income were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 

Interest income on lease financing (1)

(1) Included in Interest Income &#8211; Loans and leases in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of net investment in leases, excluding purchase accounting adjustments was $ 2.7 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively. The components of net investment in direct financing leases, including the carrying amount of the lease receivables, as well as the unguaranteed residual asset were as follows: 

(in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Net investment in the lease - lease payments receivable $ 2,345 &#160; $ 3,187 &#160; Net investment in the lease - unguaranteed residual assets 306 &#160; 321 &#160; Total lease payments $ 2,651 &#160; $ 3,508 &#160;

Lessee Arrangements 

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and certain equipment. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. For the vast majority of the Company&#8217;s leases, we are not reasonably certain we will exercise our options to renew to the end of all renewal option periods. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Right of use asset assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the vast majority of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate (FHLB borrowing rate) is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. The operating lease right of use asset is measured at cost, which includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, prepaid rent and initial direct costs incurred by the Company, less incentives received. 

Variable costs such as the proportionate share of actual costs for utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred. 

The components of lease expense were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating lease cost $ 20 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 60 &#160; Total lease cost $ 20 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 60 &#160;

Note 9 - Mortgage Servicing Rights 

At September 30, 2024, we have classified all mortgage servicing rights as assets held for sale within the Statement of Condition. See Note 19 - Assets Held for Sale and Associated Liabilities. Disclosures related to the mortgage servicing rights balance at December 31, 2023 have been included within Note 19 - Assets Held for Sale and Associated Liabilities for comparability purposes. 

Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities 

We have no consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In connection with our non-qualified mortgage securitization activities, we have retained a five percent interest in the investment securities of certain trusts and are contracted as the subservicer of the underlying loans, compensated based on market rates, which constitutes a continuing involvement in these trusts. Although we have a variable interest in these securitization trusts, we are not their primary beneficiary due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the total amount of securities issued by the VIE and our inability to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance. As a result, we have not consolidated the assets and liabilities of the VIE in our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Bank&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is limited to our five percent retained interest in the investment securities that had a fair value of $ 172 million as of September 30, 2024 as well as the standard representations and warranties made in conjunction with the loan transfers. 

Note 11 - Borrowed Funds 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s borrowed funds:

(1) Does not included the effect of interest rate swap agreements. Represents current coupon rate; most advances are floating rate. 

FHLB advances include straight fixed-rate advances, floating rate advances and advances under the FHLB convertible advance program, which gives the FHLB the option of either calling the advance after an initial lock-out period of up to five years and quarterly thereafter until maturity, or a one-time call at the initial call date. 

Federal Reserve Advances 

No discount window borrowings are outstanding as of September 30, 2024 as all such borrowings were repaid in September 2024. The Company had $ 1.0 billion drawn under the Bank Term Funding Program at September 30, 2024, which was scheduled to mature in December 2024 and was repaid in October 2024. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events.

Note 13 - Stock-Related Benefits Plans 

Stock Based Compensation 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 12,949,972 shares (reflective of the 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected July 11, 2024) available for grants as restricted stock, options, or other forms of related rights under the 2020 Incentive Plan, which includes the remaining shares available, converted at the merger conversion factor from the legacy Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Stock Plan. The Company granted 2,068,462 shares of restricted stock, with an average fair value of $ 8.86 per share on the date of grant, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Compensation and benefits expense related to the restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and totaled $ 39 million and $ 31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost relating to unvested restricted stock totaled $ 79 million. This amount will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 2.1 years. 

Forfeitures of Restricted Stock Awards are accounted for as they occur. 

Stock Options 

On March 6, 2024, the Company granted 6,333,333 stock options ( 1,333,333 vest on March 6, 2025 and 5,000,000 vest in 12 equal quarterly installments on the final day of each quarter beginning June 30, 2024) to senior executives of the Company. These options expire on March 6, 2034. On April 25, 2024 the Company granted 3,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company; these options vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date and expire on April 25, 2031. On June 21, 2024 the Company granted 1,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company which vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. These options expire on June 21, 2031. On July 24, 2024 the Company granted 1,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company, which vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. These options expire on July 24, 2031. On July 29, 2024 the Company granted 2,000,000 stock options to senior executives of the Company, which vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. These options will expire on July 29, 2031. All relevant share information related to stock options is reflective of the 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected July 11, 2024. The Company generally utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock option grants, although measurements for long-dated options are difficult due to lack of market data appropriate for the instrument lives. No stock options were forfeited during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company estimates the options granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to have a grant date fair-value of $ 72 million, which will be recognized in compensation expense over the vesting period.

Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposure to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and liquidity risks, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company's policy is to present our derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for set-off are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties, variation margin payments are recognized as settlements. We are exposed to non-performance risk by the counterparties to our various derivative financial instruments. A majority of our derivatives are centrally cleared through a Central Counterparty Clearing House or consist of residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments further limiting our exposure to non-performance risk. We believe that the non-performance risk inherent in our remaining derivative contracts is minimal based on credit standards and the collateral provisions of the derivative agreements. 

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company maintains a derivative portfolio of interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, futures, swaptions and forward commitments used to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and mortgage servicing right asset values and to meet the needs of customers. The Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale is managed using corresponding forward sale commitments and U.S. Treasury futures. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments . The Company has previously designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rates-based variable interest payments on federal home loan bank advances. Changes in the fair value of derivatives previously designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $ 74 million (net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company had $ 10 million (net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2023. There were no designated hedging relationships as of September 30, 2024. 

Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and qualitatively thereafter, unless regression analysis is deemed necessary. 

Fair Value of Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in interest rates. The Company previously used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involved the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives were used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed rate assets. For derivatives previously designated and that qualified as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk were recognized in interest income. The fair value basis adjustments remaining from discontinued hedges are recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the hedged items. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income from loans and leases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income increased by $ 7 million due to the floating rate payments received on the swaps being greater than the fixed rate payments, as well as the accretion of the fair value basis adjustment subsequent to discontinuance of the hedges. 

The fair value basis adjustment on our previously hedged real estate loans is included in loans and leases held for investment on our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The carrying amount of our hedged loans was $ 5.9 billion at September 30, 2024, of which unrealized loss of $ 24 million was due to the discontinued fair value hedge relationship.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts subject to variability caused by changes in interest rates from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $ 5.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 were designated as cash flow hedges of certain FHLB borrowings. There were no designated hedging relationships as of September 30, 2024. 

The following table presents the effect of the Company&#8217;s cash flow derivative instruments on accumulated other comprehensive loss: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 

Amount of gain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss

Amount of reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense 

$ ( 18 ) $ ( 7 ) $ ( 57 ) $ ( 19 ) 

In the third quarter 2024, the Company repaid $ 2 billion of FHLB advances that were associated with previously de-designated cash flow hedging relationships. As no future cash flows will occur as a result of the repayments, the Company reclassified the gain of approximately $ 5 million out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense during the quarter. 

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company&#8217;s variable-rate borrowings. We will recognize $ 80 million of lower interest expense over the next rolling twelve month period related to the reclassification.

Note 16 - Fair Value Measures 

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles sets forth a definition of fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles also clarifies that fair value is an &#8220;exit&#8221; price, representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset, or paid when transferring a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is thus a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability. 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

At September 30, 2024, we have classified all mortgage servicing rights as assets held for sale within the Statement of Condition. See Note 19 - Assets Held for Sale and Associated Liabilities. Fair value disclosures related to the mortgage servicing rights balance presented within assets held for sale at September 30, 2024 have been included under the caption "mortgage servicing rights" within this Note for comparability purposes. 

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications for its assets on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another. 

A description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows: 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange-traded securities. 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would 

generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, and primarily include such instruments as mortgage-related and corporate debt securities. 

Periodically, the Company uses fair values supplied by independent pricing services to corroborate the fair values derived from the pricing models. In addition, the Company reviews the fair values supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness. The Company challenges pricing service valuations that appear to be unusual or unexpected. 

While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate, and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair values of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair values at a reporting date.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such instruments are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). The following tables present assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

(2) Represents the fair value of impaired loans, based on the value of the collateral. 

The fair values of collateral-dependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques, including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate and other market data. 

Other Fair Value Disclosures 

For the disclosure of fair value information about the Company&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, when available, quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on present-value estimates or other valuation techniques. Such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used, the timing of future cash flows, and the discount rate. 

Because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature, estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes. Furthermore, in many cases, the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of such instruments. 

The following tables summarize the carrying values, estimated fair values, and fair value measurement levels of financial instruments that were not carried at fair value on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair values for the Company&#8217;s financial instruments follow: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Securities 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

Ownership in equity securities of the FHLB is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale. The carrying amount approximates the fair value. 

Loans and leases 

The Company discloses the fair value of loans measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion. The Company determined the fair value on substantially all of its loans for disclosure purposes, on an individual loan basis. The discount rates reflect current market rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers having similar credit quality on an exit price basis. For those loans where a discounted cash flow technique was not considered reliable, the Company used a quoted market price for each individual loan. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the mortgage servicing rights are option adjusted spreads, prepayment rates and cost to service. Significant increases (decreases) in all three assumptions in isolation result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Weighted average life (in years) is used to determine the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights. For September 30, 2024, the weighted average life (in years) for the entire portfolio was 6.7 . 

Rate lock commitments 

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e. the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

Deposits 

The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., interest-bearing checking and money market accounts, savings accounts, and non-interest-bearing accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. These estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships, which comprise a portion of the Company&#8217;s deposit base. 

Borrowed Funds 

The estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 

The fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions, considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers. The estimated fair values of such off-balance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Fair Value Option 

We elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to more closely align the accounting method with the underlying economic exposure. Interest income on loans held for sale is accrued on the principal outstanding primarily using the "simple-interest" method. 

The following table reflects the change in fair value included in earnings of financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected:

On July 11, 2024, a previously announced reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-3 took effect. On the effective date, every three shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held by the Company in treasury were combined into one issued share of common stock. In addition, the aggregate number of equity-based awards that remain available to be granted under the Company&#8217;s equity compensation plans was decreased proportionately and proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price, share-based vesting criteria and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares that would be owned upon vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and other equity-based awards, as applicable. The impact of the reverse stock split on the Company's preferred stock and warrants is reflected in the table above. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. 

Series A Preferred stock 

Each Series A preferred depositary share represents 1/40th interest in a share of the Company&#8217;s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $ 1,000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depositary share). Dividends accrue on the shares at a fixed rate equal to 6.375 percent per annum until March 17, 2027, and a floating rate equal to three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 408.26 basis points per annum beginning on March 17, 2027. Dividends are payable in arrears on March 17, June 17, September 17, and December 17 of each year, which commenced on June 17, 2017. In the third quarter 2024, we paid dividends on our Series A preferred stock of $ 15.94 per share. 

Series B Preferred Stock 

As of September 30, 2024, following the partial exchanges of shares of Series B Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;) described in further detail below, the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented the right (on an as converted basis) to receive approximately 250,000 shares of our common stock. Series B Preferred Stock shareholders do not have voting rights, except in limited circumstances. 

On June 5, 2024, shareholders approved (a) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 300,000,000 to 666,666,666 ; and (b) the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the March 2024 capital raise pursuant to New York Stock Exchange listing rules (the &#8220;Stockholder Approvals&#8221;). In accordance with the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations, upon obtaining the Stockholder Approvals, the quarterly non-cumulative cash dividend (annual rate of 13 percent) and liquidation preference rights ceased to apply. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock (a) are now entitled to receive dividends at the same time and on the same terms as the holders of common stock, including for the dividend declared and paid by the Company on June 17, 2024 and September 17, 2024, and (b) rank as equal to the Common Stock in any liquidation of the Company. 

August 2024 Series B Preferred Stock Exchanges

On September 23, 2024, the Company entered into separate share exchange agreements with each of Liberty and Hudson Bay (each of the share exchange agreements entered into with Liberty and Hudson Bay on September 23, 2024, a &#8220;September 2024 Exchange Agreement,&#8221; and, collectively, the &#8220;September 2024 Exchange Agreements&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the terms of each respective September 2024 Exchange Agreement, on September 23, 2024, (a) Liberty exchanged 114,355 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for the issuance by the Company of 38,118,329 shares of common stock to Liberty; and (b) Hudson Bay exchanged 13,600 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for the issuance by the Company of 4,533,331 shares of common stock to Hudson Bay (each a &#8220;September 2024 Exchange,&#8221; and, collectively, the &#8220;September 2024 Exchanges&#8221;). The number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Hudson Bay so exchanged was an amount such that Hudson Bay (together with its affiliates) would not beneficially own in excess of 9.99 % of the shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock outstanding immediately following the September 2024 Exchanges. All of the September 2024 Exchanges were consummated simultaneously. 

Immediately following the September 2024 Exchanges, (a) Liberty held no shares of Series B Preferred Stock; and (b) Hudson Bay held 750 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which are (in the aggregate) convertible into approximately 250,000 shares of common stock. 

March 2024 Investment Agreements 

Each of the Investors acquired the shares of Series B Preferred Stock that were exchanged for shares of common stock in the applicable August 2024 Exchange and September 2024 Exchange on March 11, 2024 as part of the Company&#8217;s approximately $ 1.05 billion capital raise transaction pursuant to separate investment agreements entered into with each of the Investors on March 7, 2024, each of which was amended on March 11, 2024 (collectively, the &#8220;Investment Agreements&#8221;). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is automatically convertible into shares of common stock (or, in limited circumstances, a share of Series C Noncumulative Preferred Stock of the Company) in a transfer by the holder thereof consistent with the rules and limitations of Regulation Y of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Investment Agreements contemplate that the Company, on the one hand, and each individual Investor, on the other hand, would cooperate in good faith to effect exchanges of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for shares of common stock, subject to receipt of certain approvals. The Investment Agreements, along with (i) a Registration Rights Agreement, dated March 11, 2024, entered into by the Company with the Investors and the other investors in such capital raise and (ii) warrants issued by the Company to the Investors and the other investors in such capital raise pursuant to which the holder may acquire capital stock of the Company, were disclosed and described in the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 14, 2024 and in the Company&#8217;s definitive proxy statement filed on April 26, 2024. 

The Series B Preferred Stock is classified in mezzanine equity as it is contingently convertible into shares of preferred stock that are redeemable for cash, contingent on events that are not solely in the control of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock is not remeasured because it is currently not probable that it will become redeemable. 

Series C Preferred Stock 

As of September 30, 2024, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Series C Noncumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred Stock") have converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations for the Series C Preferred Stock. 

Warrants 

Warrants to purchase shares of a new class of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Series D NVCE Stock") for an initial exercise price of $ 2,500 per share (collectively, the "Warrants"), were issued in conjunction with the March 2024 capital raise. The warrants were not exercisable until September 10, 2024 and expire 7 years after issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, as a result of the dividend paid on shares of our common stock, the exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $ 2,489 as of September 30, 2024. At the time of issuance, the Warrants entitled the holders thereof to receive an aggregate of 315,000 shares of Series D NVCE Stock (subject to net settlement of shares) upon exercise of the Warrants. 

On September 30, 2024, the holder of a Warrant notified the Company of its intent to exercise its Warrant to purchase 45 shares of Series D NVCE Stock, resulting in the issuance by the Company of 15 shares of Series D NVCE Stock after giving effect to provisions of the Warrant regarding the net settlement of shares. Accordingly, effective as of September 30, 2024, 15 shares of Series D NVCE Stock have been issued. 

Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies 

Pledged Assets 

The Company pledges securities to serve as collateral for its repurchase agreements and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings, among other purposes. We had pledged investment securities of $ 10.2 billion and $ 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had $ 50.8 billion and $ 43.1 billion of loans pledged between the FHLB-NY and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window to serve as collateral for its wholesale borrowings at the respective period-ends. 

Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit 

In the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding which are not included on our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The majority of the outstanding loan commitments were expected to close within 90 days. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet commitments to originate loans and letters of credit: 

(in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Multi-family and commercial real estate $ 32 &#160; $ 52 &#160; One-to-four family including interest rate locks 2,875 &#160; 1,694 &#160; Acquisition, development, and construction 2,787 &#160; 3,926 &#160; Warehouse loan commitments &#8212; &#160; 7,074 &#160; Other loan commitments 10,469 &#160; 11,315 &#160; Total loan commitments $ 16,163 &#160; $ 24,061 &#160; Commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit 827 &#160; 915 &#160; Total commitments $ 16,990 &#160; $ 24,976 &#160; 

Financial Guarantees 

The Company provides guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enable them to complete a variety of business transactions and to enhance their credit standings. These guarantees are recorded at their respective fair values in &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company considers the fair value of the guarantees to equal the consideration received. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s guarantees and indemnifications at September 30, 2024: 

(in millions) Maximum Potential Amount of Future Payments Financial stand-by letters of credit $ 648 &#160; Performance stand-by letters of credit 24 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 155 &#160; Total letters of credit $ 827 &#160; 

The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could be funded under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties or if indemnification provisions were triggered, as applicable, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. 

The Company collects fees upon the issuance of commercial and stand-by letters of credit. Stand-by letters of credit fees are initially recorded by the Company as a liability and are recognized as income periodically through the respective expiration dates. Fees for commercial letters of credit are collected and recognized as income at the time that they are issued and upon 

payment of each set of documents presented. In addition, the Company requires adequate collateral, typically in the form of cash, real property, and/or personal guarantees upon its issuance of irrevocable stand-by letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit are primarily secured by the goods being purchased in the underlying transaction and are also personally guaranteed by the owner(s) of the applicant company. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Legal Proceedings 

The Company is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business, including stockholder class and derivative actions. The outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of investigations or any other matters before regulatory agencies is uncertain, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, including with respect to any litigation, investigation or other regulatory actions related to (i) the business and disclosure practices of acquired companies, including our acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp and the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of Signature, (ii) the capital raise transaction we completed in March of 2024, (iii) the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, (iv) past cyber security breaches, and (v) recent events and circumstances involving the Company, including our full year 2023 earnings announcement, disclosures regarding credit losses, provisioning and goodwill impairment, and negative news and expectations about the prospects of the Company (and associated stock price volatility and changes). 

There can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, penalties, costs and/or expenses as a result of such litigation, investigations or regulatory proceedings, (ii) that the reserves we have established will be sufficient to cover such losses, or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed such reserves and have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company may incur significant legal expenses in defending such litigation, or as a result of its involvement in such investigations or regulatory proceedings, during the pendency of these matters, and in connection with any other potential cases, including expenses for the potential reimbursement of legal fees of officers and directors under indemnification obligations.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The Company has investments in mortgage servicing rights that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing. The Company accounts for mortgage servicing rights at fair value. A primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted, in part, by declining interest rates or government intervention. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. The Company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments. There is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates, which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives. For further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our mortgage servicing rights risk, see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities. On October 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale of a significant portion of its mortgage servicing rights. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 

Changes in the fair value of residential first mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of period $ 1,122 &#160; $ 1,031 &#160; $ 1,111 &#160; $ 1,033 &#160; Additions from loans sold with servicing retained 58 &#160; 67 &#160; 158 &#160; 148 &#160; Reductions from sales &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 69 ) ( 51 )

(1) Changes in fair value are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

(2) Represents estimated MSR value change resulting primarily from market-driven changes which we manage through the use of derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the hypothetical effect on fair value of servicing rights using adverse changes of 10 percent and 20 percent to the weighted average of certain significant assumptions used in valuing these assets: 

September 30, 2024 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.0 &#160; % $ ( 20 ) $ ( 38 ) Constant prepayment rate 8.3 &#160; % ( 46 ) ( 87 ) Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 68 &#160; $ ( 11 ) $ ( 22 ) 

December 31, 2023 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.4 &#160; % $ ( 20 ) $ ( 39 ) Constant prepayment rate 7.9 &#160; % ( 37 ) ( 71 ) Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 69 &#160; $ ( 10 ) $ ( 21 ) 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. To isolate the effect of the specified change, the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change, while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. For further information on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, see Note 16 - Fair Value Measures . 

Contractual servicing and subservicing fees, including late fees and other ancillary income are presented below. Contractual servicing fees are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Contractual subservicing fees including late fees and other ancillary income are included within loan administration income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subservicing fee income is recorded for fees earned on subserviced loans, net of third-party subservicing costs. 

The following table summarizes income and fees associated with owned mortgage servicing rights:

Loans held-for-investment and Other Liabilities 

The Company originated government guaranteed loans which were pooled and sold as Ginnie Mae MBS. Pursuant to Ginnie Mae servicing guidelines, the Company has the unilateral right to repurchase loans securitized in Ginnie Mae pools that are due, but unpaid, for three consecutive months. As a result, once the delinquency criteria have been met, and regardless of whether the repurchase option has been exercised, the Company accounts for the loans as if they had been repurchased. At December 31, 2023, the Company recognized the loans and corresponding liability as loans held for investment and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. At September 30, 2024, the loans and corresponding liability were presented as assets held for sale and liabilities associates with assets held for sale, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. On October 31, 2024, $ 465 million of the loans held for sale and the corresponding liability related to the repurchase option were sold. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 

Other Assets 

Other assets included in assets held for sale at September 30, 2024 are substantially all related to corporate and escrow advances, which are short-term receivables related to advances made by the Company in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, corporate and escrow advances classified as assets held for sale totaled $ 60 million. On October 31, 2024 we sold a significant portion of the corporate and escrow advances classified as assets held for sale. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 

Note 20 - Subsequent Events 

Sale of Mortgage Servicing and Third Party Origination Platform 

On October 31, 2024, we executed the previously announced sale of certain mortgage servicing rights and servicing related assets and liabilities which represent substantially all of our mortgage servicing activities, third party loan origination platform and other related assets and liabilities, for approximately $ 1.3 billion in total cash and other consideration. Other consideration consists of a customary five percent holdback related to mortgage servicing rights to be settled later in the fourth quarter 2024. This includes the sale of nearly all of the mortgage servicing rights, loans, other assets and other liabilities 

classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale at September 30, 2024. We expect to recognize a pre-tax net gain on sale in the fourth quarter 2024 of approximately $ 175 million. We also expect to incur pre-tax costs, primarily the impairment of capitalized assets and severance costs associated with the transaction totaling approximately $ 75 million. A portion of the employees involved in the servicing activities will remain employees of the Company during a transitional period and ultimately transition to the purchaser, who will reimburse us for the cost of the employees during the transition period. 

Federal Reserve Advances 

The Company had $ 1.0 billion drawn under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program at September 30, 2024, which was scheduled to mature in December 2024. This draw was repaid in full during October 2024.
