The following additional risk factor supplements the risk factors disclosed in Part I &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The COVID-19

Pandemic May Have a Material Impact on Our Results of Operations 

The COVID-19

pandemic is negatively impacting economic activity, the financial markets, and commerce, both globally and within the United States. In our market area, the governor of New York has issued an order that, among other things, requires residents to stay in their homes and permits them to leave only to conduct certain essential activities or to travel to work and close all non-essential

businesses to the general public. These stay-at-home

order and travel restrictions &#8211; and similar orders imposed across the United States to restrict the spread of COVID-19

&#8211; have resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, and mass layoffs and furloughs. Moreover, the rapid pace at which these issues are developing could overwhelm our ability to deal with them in a timely manner. The Company&#8217;s results of operations may be materially impacted if businesses remain closed for an extended period of time or unemployment remains at elevated levels for an extended period of time.

As an essential business, we have implemented business continuity plans and continue to provide financial services to clients, while taking health and safety measures such as transitioning most in-person

customer transactions to our drive-thru facilities and limiting access to the interior of our facilities, frequent cleaning of our facilities, and using a remote workforce where possible. Despite these safeguards, we may nonetheless experience business disruptions.

The continued spread of COVID-19

and the efforts to contain the virus, including stay-at-home

orders and travel restrictions, could:

&#160; &#8226; cause changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits, which may affect the demand for loans and other products and services we offer, as well as the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; cause our borrowers to be unable to meet existing payment obligations, particularly those borrowers that may be disproportionately affected by business shut downs and travel restrictions resulting in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; result in the lack of property transactions and asset sales; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; cause the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, to decline in value; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; reduce the availability and productivity of our employees; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; cause our vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing obligations to us; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; negatively impact the business and operations of third party service providers that perform critical services for our business; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; result in a downgrade in our credit ratings; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; prevent us from satisfying our minimum capital and other regulatory requirements; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; impede our ability to close mortgage loans, if appraisers and title companies are unable to perform their functions; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; cause the value of our securities portfolio to decline. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Any one or a combination of the above events could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Moreover, our success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers, many of whom have held officer positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19 

could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy.
