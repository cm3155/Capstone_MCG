MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For the purpose of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; are used to refer to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiary, New York Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING LANGUAGE 

This report, like many written and oral communications presented by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. 

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of the words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;strive,&#8221; &#8220;try,&#8221; or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; or similar expressions. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations as reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will be achieved or realized. 

Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans and strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

RECONCILIATIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, 

AND TANGIBLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY&#59; 

TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS&#59; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

(unaudited) 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons: 

&#160;

1. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. 

&#160;

2. 

Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. 

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity&#59; our total assets and tangible assets&#59; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company reported net income of $115.8 million, up 10% compared to the $105.3 million reported for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and up 17% compared to the $99.0 million the Company reported for the three months ended September 30, 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income was $321.4 million, up 9% compared to the $293.9 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $107.6 million, up 11% compared to the $97.1 million reported for the second quarter of 2020, and up 18% compared to the $90.8 million reported for the three months ended September 30, 2019. On a year-to-date basis, net income available to common shareholders totaled $296.8 million, up 10% compared to the $269.2 million reported &#160; during the first nine months of 2019.

On a per share basis, the Company reported diluted EPS of $0.23 for the third quarter of 2020, up 10% compared to the $0.21 reported for the second quarter of 2020, and up 21% compared to the $0.19 reported for the third quarter of 2019. For the first nine months of 2020, diluted EPS were $0.63, up 11% compared to diluted EPS of $0.57 for the first nine months of 2019.

The key trends in the quarter were: 

Continued Double-Digit Net Interest Margin Expansion

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company experienced further double-digit improvement in the NIM. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 the NIM was 2.29%, up 11 bps compared to the prior quarter and up 30 bps compared to the third quarter of last year. Prepayment income contributed nine bps to the third quarter NIM, unchanged compared to the contribution in the previous quarter and compared to 11 bps for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, the third quarter NIM, on a non-GAAP basis, would have been 2.20%, up 11 bps compared to the previous quarter and up 32 bps compared to the year-ago quarter.

The improvement during the current quarter was the result of a substantial decline in both the average cost of deposits and in the average cost of borrowed funds. The average cost of deposits declined to 0.85% during the current third quarter, down 31 bps compared to the previous quarter and down 104 bps compared to the year-ago third quarter. This was primarily due to lower rates on CDs. The average cost of CDs during the third quarter was 1.52%, down 48 bps compared to the second quarter and down 93 bps compared to the third quarter of last year. This was in keeping with the Company&#8217;s strategy to significantly reduce CD rates given the decline in market rates and the potential that interest rates will remain low for an extended period of time. Similarly, the average cost of borrowings declined nine bps to 1.97% compared to the previous quarter and 41 bps compared to the year-ago quarter.

A Significant Decline in Loan Deferrals

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers, in accordance with the CARES Act. These modifications were primarily full payment deferrals for an initial six-month period, with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period, at the Bank&#8217;s discretion. The overwhelming majority of these deferrals were entered into during April and May of this year. Accordingly, the majority of these deferrals were eligible to come off of their initial deferral during October and November.

Between June 30, 2020 and October 31, 2020 , we had $3.1 billion of loan deferrals that were eligible to come off of their initial deferral period. As of October 31 , 2020, approximately 98% of these deferrals returned to payment status, while the remaining 2% or $69 million have come off of deferral but were still due for their first payment. We continue to work with these borrowers, on a case-by-case basis, to provide additional assistance, if needed, in line with the CARES Act and interagency regulatory guidelines. 

Ongoing Top-Line Revenue Growth

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $281.9 million, up $16.0 million or 6% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, and up $46.0 million or 19% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. Both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in net interest income were driven by significantly lower levels of interest expense. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 declined $21.0 million or 13% to $136.2 million on a linked-quarter basis, while on a year-over-year basis, it decreased $82.5 million or 38%.

Prepayment income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $11.6 million, up 2% compared to the previous quarter, but down 18% compared to the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, net interest income on a non-GAAP basis would have been $270.3 million, up $15.8 million or 6% on a linked-quarter basis and up $48.5 million or 22% on a year-over-year basis.

Our Asset Quality Continues to Improve

The Company&#8217;s asset quality metrics improved during the current third quarter, reflecting the underlying strength of our loan portfolio. NPAs at September 30, 2020 were $54.9 million compared to $63.2 million at June 30, 2020, down 13%. This represents 0.10% of total assets compared to 0.12% of total assets in the previous quarter. Total non-accrual mortgage loans were $18.4 million compared to $24.2 million at June 30, 2020, down 24%. Other non-accrual loans were $26.9 million compared to $29.5 million during the previous quarter, down 9%. Total repossessed assets were $9.5 million, unchanged from the previous quarter and down from the $12.3 million we reported at December 31, 2019.

As in prior quarters, the majority of our NPAs were composed of non-performing taxi medallion-related loans and repossessed taxi medallion-related assets. Excluding the impact from these non-performing taxi medallion-related assets, third quarter 2020 NPAs would have been $22.9 million or 0.04% of total assets compared to $29.6 million or 0.05% of total assets at June 30, 2020. &#160;

&#160; Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On October 27, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on November 17, 2020 to common shareholders of record as of November 7, 2020. 

The CARES Act 

The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020, after the President declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. It provides, among other things, money for unemployment benefits, financial aid checks to individuals and forgivable SBA loans, known as the Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;). This program provides loans to small businesses to keep their employees on payroll. The original funding was fully allocated by mid-April, and additional funding was made available on April 24, 2020, under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The Company is a participant in the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program established to help consumers and small businesses. As of September 30, 2020, the Company funded approximately 1,300 requests totaling $117.3 million under the PPP. These loans were designated as held for sale as of quarter end.

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used therein, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies: the determination of the allowances for loan and lease losses&#59; and the determination of the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. 

The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

The Company&#8217;s January 1, 2020, adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since December 31, 2019. ASU No. 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under ASC Topic 842. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the Company expects to collect. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, fair value hedge accounting adjustments, and deferred fees and costs. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Management estimates the allowance by projecting probability-of-default, loss-given-default and exposure-at-default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term. Economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and economic forecasts. The Company&#8217;s economic forecast period reverts to a historical norm based on inputs after 24 months. Historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, with adjustments made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels and terms, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in legislation, regulation, policies, administrative practices or other relevant factors. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals. The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions. Each quarter, we reassess the appropriateness of the economic period, the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level, considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and other relevant data shifts over time. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Management believes the products within each of the entity&#8217;s portfolio classes exhibit similar risk characteristics. Loans that are determined to have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis by management. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient, expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, less costs to sell as appropriate. The macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on an economic forecast period of 24 months. The Company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast. Beyond this forecast period, we revert to a historical average loss rate. This reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 

The portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses. Smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment to which factors in the qualitative scorecard include: concentration, modeling and forecast imprecision and limitations, policy and underwriting, prepayment uncertainty, external factors, nature and volume, management, and loan review. Each factor is subject to an evaluation of metrics, consistently applied, to measure adjustments needed for each reporting period. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as TDR or &#8220;reasonably expected TDR&#8221; (criticized, classified, or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months). In addition, all taxi medallion loans are individually evaluated. 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was $12.3 million and $461,000, respectively. Included in the September 30, 2020 amount was a $12.5 million adjustment related to the adoption of CECL. We estimate expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life. The Company examined historical credit conversion factor (&#8220;CCF&#8221;) trends to estimate utilization rates, and chose an appropriate mean CCF based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis involved examination of CCFs over a range 

of fund-up windows (between 12 and 36 months) and comparison of the mean CCF for each fund-up window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean CCF across fund-up windows made business sense. The Company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 the allowance for loan and lease losses increased primarily due to macroeconomic factors surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the resultant estimated decreases in property values. The forecast scenario includes low single digit growth of Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;), while unemployment remains elevated into the forecasted time horizon. In addition to these quantitative inputs, several qualitative factors were considered, including the risk that the economic decline proves to be more severe and/or prolonged than our baseline forecast which also increased our allowance for loan and lease credit losses. The impact of the unprecedented fiscal stimulus and changes to federal and local laws and regulations, including changes to various government sponsored loan programs, was also considered. 

Current Expected Credit Losses 

At December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $147.6 million. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the CECL methodology under ASU Topic 326. Upon adoption, we recognized an increase in the ALLL of $1.9 million as a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment from changes in methodology, with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings. At September 30, 2020, the ALLL totaled $188.3 million, up $40.7 million compared to December 31, 2019 driven by a provision for credit losses of $51.8 million that exceeded net charge-offs by $38.8 million during the first nine months of 2020. This increase reflects deterioration in forecasted economic conditions since the beginning of the year, arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily the result of estimated decreases in property values. To a lesser extent, the increase also reflects loan growth over the course of the year.

Separately, at December 31, 2019, the Company had an allowance for unfunded commitments of $461,000. With the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we recognized a &#8220;Day 1&#8221; transition adjustment of $12.5 million. At September 30, 2020, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $12.3 million.

Goodwill Impairment 

The Company adopted, on a prospective basis, ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment on January 1, 2020. We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and as of September 30, 2020, we had goodwill of $2.4 billion. In connection with our acquisitions, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. We have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment and reportable segment. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to the recorded goodwill balance. 

We perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more often if events or circumstances warrant. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we would compare the fair value the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. The loss recognized, however, would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, we would consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. 

The Company assessed the environment in the third quarter of 2020, including the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic variables and economic forecasts and how those might impact the fair value of our reporting unit. After consideration of the items above and the first nine months of 2020 results, the Company determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below book value as of September 30, 2020 . We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and its impact on our market capitalization, overall economic conditions , and any triggering events that may indicate an impairment of goodwill in the future. 

Balance Sheet Summary 

At September 30, 2020, total assets were $54.9 billion, up $1.3 billion compared to December 31, 2019. This was due to a combination of loan growth and growth in the level of cash and cash equivalents, offset by a decline in the securities portfolio. This growth was funded primarily through wholesale borrowings as total deposits remained relatively unchanged. At September 30, 2020, total deposits were stable at $31.7 billion, however, the deposit mix is trending toward lower cost deposit account categories. Borrowed funds rose $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2019, most of which was attributable to growth in FHLB-NY advances. 

Total loans and leases held for investment increased to $42.8 billion, up $935 million or 3% annualized compared to December 31, 2019 and were up $523 million or 5% annualized compared to June 30, 2020. Loan growth in both the year-to-date and quarter-to-date periods was driven by continued growth in the multi-family portfolio and in the specialty finance portfolio, offset by a decline in the CRE portfolio.

Total securities, consisting mainly of available-for-sale securities, declined $621 million compared to December 31, 2019 but increased modestly compared to June 30, 2020. The Company has generally refrained from meaningfully growing the securities portfolio given the currently low interest rate environment, which is expected to persist into the foreseeable future.

Total multi-family loans rose $942 million or 4% annualized compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, to $32.1 billion. On a linked-quarter basis, total multi-family loans increased $504 million or 6% annualized compared to June 30, 2020. Specialty finance loans and leases increased $138 million to $3.1 billion or 19% annualized compared to the second quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, specialty finance loans and leases grew $439 million or 22% annualized compared to December 31, 2019. The CRE loan portfolio declined $197 million or 4% annualized compared to the balance at December 31, 2019 and declined $45 million or 3% annualized compared to the balance as of June 30, 2020. Other C&#38;I loans declined $27 million or 8% annualized to $394.3 million compared to December 31, 2019, but rose $13 million or 14% annualized compared to June 30, 2020. &#160; 

Total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $31.7 billion. This was relatively unchanged compared to both year-end 2019 and the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Trends over the year exhibited a decline in CD balances, offset by increases in other, lower-cost deposit account categories.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total CDs declined $3.2 billion to $11.0 billion compared to year-end 2019, including a $1.1 billion decrease during the current third quarter. The reduction in CD balances since the beginning of the year is attributable to the Company&#8217;s strategy to significantly reduce the rates offered on its CDs, given the extraordinary decline in market interest rates since the first quarter of the year. This decline was offset by growth in other deposit categories, including savings accounts, interest-bearing checking and money market accounts, and non-interest bearing checking accounts. &#160; 

Savings accounts increased $340 million on a linked-quarter basis to $6.0 billion and they increased $1.2 billion during the first nine months of 2020. Interest-bearing checking and money market accounts rose $553 million to $11.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis, and they rose $1.5 billion year-to-date. Non-interest bearing accounts grew $135 million on a linked-quarter basis to $3.1 billion, and grew $624 million on a year-to-date basis.

Total borrowed funds at September 30, 2020 increased $1.1 billion to $15.7 billion, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, and $675 million compared to June 30, 2020. This was entirely due to an increase in wholesale borrowings, which consist of FHLB-NY advances. Wholesale borrowings rose $1.1 billion to $15.0 billion, up 11% annualized compared to the balance at year-end 2019 and $675 million or 19% annualized compared to the second quarter of 2020.

Total stockholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2020 was $6.7 billion, relatively unchanged compared to year-end 2019 and up $42 million compared to second-quarter 2020. Book value per common share was $13.43 at September 30, 2020, compared to $13.34 at June 30, 2020 and to $13.29 at December 31, 2019. Common stockholders&#8217; equity to total assets was 11.34% at September 30, 2020 compared to 11.42% at June 30, 2020 and 11.57% at December 31, 2019.

On a tangible basis, excluding goodwill of $2.4 billion, tangible book value per common share was $8. 20 at September 30, 2020 compared to $ 8 . 11 at June 30, 2020 and $8.09 at December 31, 2019. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets was 7.2 5 % at September 30, 2020 compared to 7. 27 % at June 30, 2020 and 7.39% at December 31, 2019. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and Leases Originated for Investment 

The majority of the loans we originate are loans and leases held for investment and most of the held-for-investment loans we produce are multi-family loans. Our production of multi-family loans began over five decades ago in the five boroughs of New York City, where the majority of the rental units currently consist of non-luxury, rent-regulated apartments featuring below-market rents. In addition to multi-family loans, our portfolio of loans held for investment contains a number of CRE loans, most of which are secured by income-producing properties located in New York City and Long Island. 

In addition to multi-family and CRE loans, our specialty finance loans and leases have become an increasingly larger portion of our overall loan portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio includes smaller balances of C&#38;I loans, one-to-four family loans, ADC loans, and other loans held for investment. The majority of C&#38;I loans consist of loans to small- and mid-size businesses. 

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company originated $3.0 billion of loans and leases held for investment, down 9% on a linked-quarter basis and up 31% on a year-over-year basis. Third quarter 2020 originations exceeded the previous quarter&#8217;s pipeline by $800 million. The linked-quarter decline was due to a 13% drop in multi-family originations and a 16% decline in specialty finance originations, while the year-over-year improvement was driven by a 78% increase in multi-family originations, partially offset by an 8% decrease in specialty finance originations and a 45% decline in CRE originations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total loans and leases originated for investment increased $1.7 billion or 23% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Year-to-date originations were driven by multi-family originations, up $2 billion or 49% and specialty finance originations, up $247 million or 12%. All other major loan segments declined.

The Company also originated $ 119.2 million of PPP loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 . At September 30, 2020 , all of these loans were classified as &#8220;Held-for-Sale&#8221;. 

Loans and Leases Held for Investment 

The individual held-for-investment loan portfolios are discussed in detail below. 

Multi-Family Loans 

Multi-family loans are our principal asset. The loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury residential apartment buildings in New York City that are rent-regulated and feature below-market rents&#8212;a market we refer to as our &#8220;Primary Lending Niche.&#8221; The majority of our multi-family loans are made to long-term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to rent regulation and feature below-market rents. 

At September 30, 2020 multi-family loans represented $32.1 billion, or 75%, of total loans and leases held for investment reflecting a $942 million increase from the balance at December 31, 2019. The average multi-family loan had a principal balance of $6.6 million at the end of the current third quarter and an average weighted life of 2.0 years. 

The majority of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings. In addition, at September 30, 2020, 78.4% of our multi-family loans were secured by buildings in the metro New York City area and 3.1% were secured by buildings elsewhere in New York State. The remaining multi-family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets, including in the four other states served by our retail branch offices. 

In addition, $19.1 billion or 60% of the Company&#8217;s total multi-family portfolio is secured by properties in New York State and subject to rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the rent regulated multi-family portfolio was 53.84% as of September 30, 2020 compared to 57.38% for the overall multi-family portfolio or 354 basis points lower. 

While a small percentage of our multi-family loans are ten-year fixed rate credits, the vast majority of our multi-family loans feature a term of ten or twelve years, with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan, and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve. The rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread. During the remaining years, the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest, plus a spread. Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY, plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five-or seven-year term. 

Multi-family loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed-rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. For example, a ten-year multi-family loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance. A twelve-year multi-family loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points. 

Because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income, they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interest-earning assets, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin, and the level of net interest income we record. No assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income, as such income is only recorded when cash is received. 

Our success as a multi-family lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market&#8217;s leading mortgage brokers, who are familiar with our lending practices, our underwriting standards, and our long-standing practice of basing our loans on the existing, in-place cash flows produced by the properties. The process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and, because the multi-family market is largely broker-driven, the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced. 

Our emphasis on multi-family loans is driven by several factors, including their structure, which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree. Another factor driving our focus on multi-family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce. Reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing status have actually resulted in losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn. 

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. The sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market, as well as general economic conditions, and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property&#59; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service&#59; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service&#59; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 120% on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75% of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, some of our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years&#59; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans represented $6.9 billion, or 16%, of total loans and leases held for investment at the end of the current third quarter, a $197 million decrease from the balance at December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, the average CRE loan had a principal balance of $6.7 million and the average weighted life was 2.3 years. 

The CRE loans we produce are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At September 30, 2020, 85.2% of our CRE loans were secured by properties in the metro New York City area, while properties in other parts of New York State accounted for 2.3% of the properties securing our CRE credits, and properties located in all other states accounted for 12.5%, combined. 

The terms of our CRE loans are similar to the terms of our multi-family credits. While a small percentage of our CRE loans feature ten-year fixed-rate terms, they primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan that is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread. During years six through ten or eight through twelve, the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest, plus a spread. Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five- or seven-year term. 

Prepayment penalties also apply to our CRE loans. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. Our CRE loans tend to refinance within two to three years of origination, as reflected in the expected weighted average life of the CRE portfolio noted above. 

Specialty Finance Loans and Leases 

At September 30, 2020, specialty finance loans and leases totaled $3.1 billion of total loans and leases held for investment, up $439 million compared to December 31, 2019, representing 7.1% of total held-for-investment loans. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable lease. Asset-based and dealer floor-plan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to LIBOR, while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over Treasuries. 

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

C&#38;I Loans 

At September 30, 2020, C&#38;I loans totaled $394.3 million compared to $421.0 million at December 31, 2019. Included in the quarter-end balance were taxi medallion-related loans of $31.2 million, representing 0.1% of total held-for-investment loans at September 30, 2020. 

The C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses in the five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 

A broad range of C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

The interest rates on our other C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on other C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

ADC loans declined to $86.0 million at September 30, 2020 compared to $200.6 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.20% of total held-for-investment loans at the current third-quarter end. Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. &#160; . 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At September 30, 2020, one-to-four family loans held for investment decreased to $274.1 million, representing 0.64% of total loans held for investment at that date. 

Other Loans 

At September 30, 2020, other loans totaled $6.5 million and consisted primarily of overdraft loans and loans to non-profit organizations. We currently do not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit. 

Lending Authority 

The loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies approved by the Management Credit Committee, the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate and Credit Committees of the Board, and the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $3.0 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $3.0 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and Specialty Finance loans regardless of amount are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, and C&#38;I loans in excess of $5.0 million and Specialty Finance in excess of $15.0 million are also required to be presented to the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee of the Board, as applicable so that the Committees can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks. The Commercial Credit and Mortgage and Real Estate Committees have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

All mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million, specialty finance loans in excess of $15.0 million and all other C&#38;I loans in excess of $5.0 million require approval by the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee or the Credit Committee of the Board, as applicable. 

In addition, all loans of $20.0 million or more originated by the Bank continue to be reported to the Board of Directors. 

At September 30, 2020, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $329.0 million multi-family loan originated by the Bank on May 8, 2018 that is collateralized by six properties in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination.

At September 30, 2020, the largest concentration of ADC loans held for investment was located in Metro New York, with a total of $69.2 million at that date. The majority of our other loans held for investment were secured by properties and/or businesses located in Metro New York. 

Outstanding Loan Commitments 

At September 30, 2020, we had outstanding loan commitments of $2.7 billion, as compared to $2.0 billion from the level at December 31, 2019. 

Multi-family, CRE, ADC and 1-4 family loans together represented $660.4 million of held-for-investment loan commitments at the end of the quarter, while other loans represented $2.1 billion. Included in the latter amount were commitments to originate specialty finance loans and leases of $1.5 billion and commitments to originate other C&#38;I loans of $546.4 million. 

In addition to loan commitments, we had commitments to issue financial stand-by, performance stand-by, and commercial letters of credit totaling $389.7 million at September 30, 2020, a $120.2 million decrease from the volume at December 31, 2019. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in Fee Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Asset Quality 

Non-Performing Loans and Repossessed Assets 

NPAs at September 30, 2020 were $54.9 million, down 13% compared to the level at June 30, 2020 or 0.10% of total assets compared to 0.12% of total assets at the end of the second quarter of 2020.

Total NPLs at September 30, 2020 were $ 45 . 4 million, down $ 8.3 million or 16 % compared to June 30, 2020 . This translates into 0.1 1 % of total loans compared to 0.1 3 % at June 30, 2020 . Included in the third quarter total was $2 4 . 4 million of non-accrual taxi medallion-related loans compared to $2 6 . 0 million at June 30, 2020 . 

Total repossessed assets at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were $9.5 million, unchanged compared to the amount at the end of the second quarter of 2020. At both September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, repossessed assets included $7.6 million of repossessed taxi medallions. At September 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s remaining taxi medallion-related assets totaled $38.8 million, down $1.6 million or 4% compared to June 30, 2020.

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company reported a net recovery of $901,000 compared to net charge-offs of $3.8 million or 0.01% of average loans in the previous quarter. Included in the September 30, 2020 results was a $1.2 million recovery on previously charged off taxi medallion loans compared to $3.0 million in net charge-offs at June 30, 2020. &#160; 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net charge-offs totaled $13.1 million or 0.03% of average loans compared to $15.8 million or 0.04% of average loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Included in the net charge-off amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, net charge-off amounts were $8.6 million and $6.8 million, respectively, of taxi medallion-related charge-offs.

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recorded when received in cash. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all of our non-performing loans were non-accrual loans. 

We monitor non-accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area, which is defined as including: (a) the counties that comprise our CRA Assessment area, and (b) the entirety of the following states: Arizona&#59; Florida&#59; New York&#59; New Jersey&#59; Ohio&#59; and Pennsylvania, in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising the collateral properties&#59; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and/or retained legal counsel, as applicable&#59; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information&#59; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance&#59; monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed&#59; and appointing a receiver, whenever possible, to collect rents, manage the operations, provide information, and maintain the collateral properties. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing loans, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, in the event that such a loan is 90 days or more past due, and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. We do not analyze LTVs on a portfolio-wide basis. 

Non-performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Management Credit Committee, the Commercial and the Mortgage and Real Estate Credit Committees of the Board, and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank, as applicable. Collateral-dependent non-performing loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers. 

Properties and assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as either OREO or repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property/asset. Subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO or repossessed assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise the properties/assets on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties/assets as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s or asset&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval, with a member of the Mortgage or Credit Committee participating in inspections on multi-family loans to be originated in excess of $7.5 million, and a member of the Mortgage or Credit Committee participating in inspections on CRE loans to be originated in excess of $4.0 million. We continue to conduct inspections as per the aforementioned policy, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently full access to some properties and buildings may be limited. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. In many cases, a second independent appraisal review is performed. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain new rent regulation laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time. While our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 120% for multi-family loans and 130% for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75% of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65% on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at September 30, 2020 . Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130% and a maximum LTV of 65%. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years&#59; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit&#59; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. Furthermore, in the case of multi-family loans, the cash flows generated by the properties are generally below-market and have significant value. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75% of the estimated as-completed market value of multi-family and residential tract projects&#59; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80%. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65% of the estimated as-completed market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation. 

Other C&#38;I loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower&#8217;s business, and are generally collateralized by various business assets, including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable. As a result, the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful. Furthermore, the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, and may fluctuate in value, based upon the operating results of the business. Accordingly, personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other C&#38;I loans. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings.

Does not include any past due taxi medallion-related loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing or as an accruing TDR, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can adversely impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. 

Based upon all relevant and available information as of the end of the current third quarter, management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date. 

At September 30, 2020, our three largest non-performing loans were one CRE loan with a balance of $9.8 million, one C&#38;I loan with a balance of $2.0 million, and a multi-family loan with a balance of $1.8 million. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, we have selectively extended to certain borrowers such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates, as well as forbearance agreements, when such borrowers have exhibited financial difficulty. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. 

The eligibility of a borrower for work-out concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction, which may change from period to period, and involve management&#8217;s judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the Company. 

Loans modified as TDRs are placed on non-accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. This generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. At September 30, 2020, non-accrual TDRs included taxi medallion-related loans with a combined balance of $23.0 million. 

At September 30, 2020, loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extensions of maturity dates totaled $26.9 million&#59; loans in connection with which forbearance agreements were reached totaled $15.0 million at that date. 

Based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms, our success rates for restructured CRE loans, was 100%. The success rates for restructured one-to-four family and other loans were 33% and 18%, respectively, at September 30, 2020.

On a limited basis, we may provide additional credit to a borrower after a loan has been placed on non-accrual status or classified as a TDR if, in management&#8217;s judgment, the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, no such additions were made. Furthermore, the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of non-payment of a restructured loan. 

Except for the non-accrual loans and TDRs disclosed in this filing, we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case. 

Loan Deferrals 

Under U.S. GAAP, banks are required to assess modifications to a loan&#8217;s terms for potential classification as a TDR. A loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider, such as a payment deferral or interest concession. In order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers, the CARES Act and bank regulators have provided relief from TDR accounting. The main benefits of TDR relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced risk-weighted assets, as TDRs are more heavily risk-weighted for capital purposes&#59; aging of the loans is frozen, i.e., they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification&#59; and the loans are generally not reported as non-accrual during the modification period. 

Under the CARES Act, the Company made the election to deem that loan modifications do not result in TDRs if they are (1) related to the novel coronavirus disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;)&#59; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019&#59; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the COVID-19 national emergency declaration or (B) December 31, 2020.

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers, in accordance with the CARES Act and interagency regulatory guidance. These modifications were primarily full payment deferrals for an initial six month period, with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period, at the Bank&#8217;s discretion. Most of these deferrals were entered into during April and May, and were therefore, they were eligible to come off of their deferral period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Accordingly, at September 30, 2020, there were no material changes in the level of loan deferrals. As of September 30, 2020, multi-family and CRE full payment deferrals totaled $5.8 billion or 13.5% of their respective portfolios, compared to $5.9 billion, or 15.5% of their respective portfolios as of June 30, 2020. &#160; 

Between June 30, 2020 and October 31, 2020, the Company had $3.1 billion of loan deferrals eligible to come off of their deferral period. As of October 31, 2020, 98% of these deferrals returned to payment status, while the remaining 2% or $48 million have come off deferral but are still due for their first payment. We continue to work with these borrowers on a case-by-case basis to provide additional assistance, if needed, in line with regulatory guidance and the CARES Act.

Total multi-family and CRE full payment deferrals declined 48% to $3.1 billion compared to $5.9 billion at June 30, 2020. This represents 8.0% of their respective portfolios compared to 15.5%. Going forward, we have an additional $3.1 billion of loan deferrals eligible to come off of their deferral periods, $2.9 billion of which are scheduled to do so in November 2020.

The following tables reflect, as of October 22, 2020, the aggregate amount of deferred multi-family and CRE loans by various category.

Securities 

At September 30, 2020, total securities were down $620.7 million compared to $5.9 billion at December 31, 2019 as our securities purchases have been limited due to the low interest rate environment. At September 30, 2020, securities represented 9.6% of total assets compared to 11.0% at December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, 33% of the securities portfolio was tied to floating rates.

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock, and to the extent FHLB borrowings are utilized, may further invest in FHLB stock. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Bank held FHLB-NY stock in the amount of $697.5 million and $647.6 million, respectively. FHLB-NY stock continued to be valued at par, with no impairment required at that date. 

Dividends from the FHLB-NY to the Bank totaled 8.9 million and $9.2 million, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, dividends from the FHLB-NY totaled $27.8 million and $30.0 million respectively.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in Non-Interest Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, our investment in BOLI increased $14.0 million to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our Consolidated Statements of Condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For more information about the Company&#8217;s goodwill, see the discussion of &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; earlier in this report. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company (i.e., the Company on an unconsolidated basis) has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Company by the Bank&#59; capital raised through the issuance of stock&#59; and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: deposits&#59; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings&#59; the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans&#59; and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Loan repayments and sales totaled $8.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, up $1.5 billion from the $6.6 billion recorded in the year-earlier nine months. Cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in the corresponding periods, while purchases of securities totaled $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. From time to time, we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits, depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

At September 30, 2020, our deposits totaled $31.7 billion, up $47.8 million compared to the level at December 31, 2019. At the end of the current third quarter, total deposits represented 57.7% of total assets, while CDs represented 34.7% of our total deposits. 

Included in the September 30, 2020 balance of deposits were business institutional deposits of $1.1 billion and municipal deposits of $726.0 million, as compared to $1.1 billion and $990.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Brokered deposits rose $39.7 million during the third quarter of the year to $5.3 billion, reflecting a $147.9 million increase in brokered money market accounts to $2.8 billion and a $404.3 million decrease in brokered CDs to $1.2 billion. In addition, at September 30, 2020, we had $1.4 billion of brokered interest bearing checking accounts, an increase of $296.1 million from December 31, 2019. The extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors, including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources, and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds. 

Borrowed Funds 

Borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings (i.e., FHLB-NY advances, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased) and, to a far lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures. As of September 30, 2020, the balance of borrowed funds increased $1.1 billion from year-end 2019 to $15.7 billion, representing 28.6% of total assets, at that date. The majority of the increase was related to a greater level of wholesale borrowings. Wholesale borrowings rose $1.1 billion from the year-end 2019 amount to $15.0 billion. FHLB-NY advances increased $1.1 billion since December 31, 2019, to $14.2 billion, while the balance of repurchase agreements was $800.0 million at September 30, 2020, unchanged from the balance at December 31, 2019. 

Subordinated Notes 

On November 6, 2018, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2028. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include opportunistic repurchases of shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program. The Notes were offered to the public at 100% of their face amount. At September 30, 2020, the balance of subordinated notes was $295.5 million, which excludes certain costs related to their issuance. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $360.2 million at September 30, 2020, comparable to the balance at December 31, 2019. 

Risk Definitions 

The following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, and how the Company manages market and interest rate risk: 

Interest Rate Risk &#8211; Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk)&#59; from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting Company activities (basis risk)&#59; from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk)&#59; and from interest-related options embedded in a bank&#8217;s products (options risk). The evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex, illiquid hedging strategies or products, and also the potential impact on fee income (e.g. prepayment income) which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. In those situations where trading is separately managed, this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios. 

Market Risk &#8211; Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodities markets. Many banks use the term &#8220;price risk&#8221; interchangeably with market risk&#59; this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, and volatilities) that affect the value of traded instruments. The primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation (e.g., trading accounts for securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange products). 

Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a bank&#8217;s inability to meet its obligations when they become due, without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk also arises from a bank&#8217;s failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. 

Management of Market and Interest Rate Risk 

We manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The asset and liability management process has three primary objectives: to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts&#59; to determine the appropriate level of risk, given our business strategy, risk appetite, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives&#59; and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Market and Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Boards of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated&#59; seasonal factors&#59; demographic variables&#59; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

We manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: (1) We have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans&#59; (2) We have continued the origination of certain C&#38;I loans that feature floating interest rates&#59; (3) We replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings&#59; and (4) In 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $2.0 billion to hedge certain real estate loans. 

LIBOR Transition Process 

On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The FRB established the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;), comprised of a group of private market participants and other members, representing banks and financial sector regulators, to identify a set of alternative reference rates for potential use as benchmarks. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or &#8220;SOFR&#8221; as the preferred alternative rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR. 

The Bank has established a sub-committee of its ALCO to address issues related to the phase-out and ultimate transition away from LIBOR to an alternate rate. This sub-committee is led by our Chief Accounting Officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the Bank including lending, loan administration, credit risk management, finance/treasury, including interest rate risk and liquidity management, information technology, and operations. The Company has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond 2021 included in loans and leases, securities, wholesale borrowings, derivative financial instruments and long-term debt. The sub-committee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines. 

While the ARRC has recommended SOFR as the replacement for LIBOR, there is acknowledgment that the development of a credit sensitive element could be a complement to SOFR. At this time, it is unclear as to the likelihood and timing of this occurring, but such a development could have an impact on our transition efforts. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are &#8220;interest rate sensitive&#8221; and by monitoring a bank&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity &#8220;gap.&#8221; An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. 

At September 30, 2020, our one-year gap was a negative 5.46%, compared to a negative 6.92% at June 30, 2020 and a negative 12.31% at December 31, 2019. The change in our one-year gap from December 31, 2019, primarily reflects a decrease in CDs and borrowings maturing within one year. 

The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2020 which, based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience, are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of (1) the term to repricing, or (2) the contractual terms of the asset or liability. 

The table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2020 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. For residential mortgage-related securities, prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average CPR of 25.25% per annum&#59; for multi-family and CRE loans, prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average CPRs of 19.87% and 11.95% per annum, respectively. Borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay. 

Savings, interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience. Based on the results of this analysis, savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 77 % for the first five years and 23% for years six through ten. Interest-bearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 88 % for the first five years and 12 % for years six through ten. The decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior. Including those accounts having specified repricing dates, money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 94 % for the first five years and 6% for years six through ten.

The interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap. While we believe our assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity. 

To validate our prepayment assumptions for our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, we perform a quarterly analysis, during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates. We continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible, since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on one-to-four family loans tend to be. In addition, we review the call provisions, if any, in our borrowings and investment portfolios and, on a monthly basis, compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable. 

As of September 30, 2020 , the impact of a 100 bp decline in market interest rates for our loans would have had very little impact on prepayment speeds due to the current low interest rates and current coupons being floored at base rates. T he impact of a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multi-family and CRE loans by a constant prepayment rate o f 5.18 % per annum. 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Also, the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates. 

Interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates, and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2020, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

The impact of a 100 bp and a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

As with the Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE Analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Accordingly, while the EVE Analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

We also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk. The simulation incorporates various market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates&#59; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories&#59; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2020 , the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged.

The impact of a 100 bp and a 200 bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap, NPV, and/or net interest income simulation. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities&#59; and/or 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At September 30, 2020, our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 7.35% decrease in net interest income&#59; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 4.63% increase in net interest income. It should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated, given the changing market rate environment, which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity. 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $ 1 . 5 billion and $741.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. As in the past, our portfolios of loans and securities provided liquidity in the first nine months of the year, with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling $ 8.1 billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling $ 2.1 &#160; b illion . 

Additional liquidity stems from the retail, institutional, and municipal deposits we gather and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings. We also have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY. The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the available amount of mortgage loan collateral under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the available amount of securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At September 30, 2020, our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY was $7.3 billion. In addition, the Company had $5.2 billion of available-for-sale securities, at that date, of which $3.9 billion was unencumbered. 

Furthermore, the Bank has an agreement with the FRB-NY that enables it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing liquidity if need be. In connection with the agreement, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds that may be borrowed. At September 30, 2020, the maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY was $1.1 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding at that date. 

Our primary investing activity is loan production. In the first nine months of 2020, the volume of loans originated for investment was $3.0 billion. During this time, the net cash used in investing activities totaled $375.7 million. Our operating activities provided net cash of $240.1 million, while the net cash provided by our financing activities totaled $852.3 million. 

CDs due to mature in one year or less as of September 30, 2020 totaled $10.4 billion, representing 95% of total CDs at that date. Our ability to retain these CDs and to attract new deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay on our deposits, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. However, there are times when we may choose not to compete for such deposits, depending on the availability of lower-cost funding, the competitiveness of the market and its impact on pricing, and our need for such deposits to fund loan demand, as previously discussed. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying dividends declared to our shareholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

The Parent Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may also depend, in part, upon dividends it receives from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the Parent Company is generally limited by New York State Banking Law and regulations, and by certain regulations of the FDIC. In addition, the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;), the FDIC, and the FRB, for reasons of safety and soundness, may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations. 

Under New York State Banking Law, a New York State-chartered stock-form savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. However, the approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Bank paid dividends totaling $285.0 million to the Parent Company, leaving $197.4 million they could dividend to the Parent Company without regulatory approval at that date. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Parent Company at September 30, 2020 included $150.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. If the Bank was to apply to the Superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations, there can be no assurance that such application would be approved. 

Capital Position 

On March 17, 2017, we issued 515,000 shares of preferred stock. The offering generated capital of $502.8 million, net of underwriting and other issuance costs, for general corporate purposes, with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the Bank. 

On October 24, 2018, the Company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved a $300 million common share repurchase program. The repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes. As of September 30, 2020 , the Company has repurchased a total of 2 8 . 9 million shares at an average price of $ 9 . 63 or an aggregate purchase price of $ 278 . 1 million, leaving $ 16 . 9 million remaining under the current authorization. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity include AOCL, which decreased $7.9 million from the balance at the end of last year and $2.9 million from the year-ago quarter to $24.9 million at September 30, 2020. The year-to-date decrease was primarily the result of a $42.3 million change in the net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and a $38.4 million change in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges, net of tax, to $37.5 million. 

Regulatory Capital 

On September 30, 2020, as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Banking Agencies announced a final rule (&#8220;2020 CECL Final Rule&#8221;) that provides banking organizations, as an alternative to the 2018 CECL Transition Election, an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of CECL on regulatory capital (the &#8220;2020 CECL Transition Election&#8221;). The 2020 CECL Final Rule became effective as of September 30, 2020 and is consistent with a prior interim final rule promulgated by the Federal Banking Agencies that became effective on March 31, 2020. 

Pursuant to the 2020 CECL Final Rule, banking organizations may elect to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact of the initial two-year delay over the next three years. The estimated cumulative impact of CECL, which will be phased in during the three-year transition period, includes the after-tax impact of adopting the CECL standard and the estimated impact of CECL in the initial two years thereafter. The 2020 CECL Final Rule introduced a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% for estimating the impact of CECL during the initial two years. The 25% &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; is an approximation of the impact of differences in credit loss allowances reflected under the CECL standard versus the incurred loss methodology. The Company has elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

At September 30, 2020, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following table sets forth our common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, at that date:

Earnings Summary for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $115.8 million, up 10% compared to the $105.3 million we reported for the three months ended June 30, 2020, and up 17% compared to the $99.0 million we reported in the year-ago third quarter &#160; . Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $107.6 million, up 11% compared to $97.1 million for the second quarter of 2020 &#160; and was up 18% compared to the $90.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2019 &#160; . On a per share basis, the Company reported diluted EPS of $0.23 for the third quarter of 2020, up 10% compared to the $0.21 reported for the second quarter of 2020.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

Net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multi-family and CRE loans, as well as securities. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. 

Linked-Quarter and Year-Over-Year Comparison 

Both the year-over-year and sequential improvement in our net interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the Company&#8217;s cost of funds, leading to a lower level of interest expense. The decrease in funding costs is a result of the FOMC lowering its federal funds target rate three times during 2019 and lowering it again, during March 2020, to near zero. This was slightly offset by lower yields on our loan portfolio and in the securities portfolio. 

Details of the increase in net interest income follow: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Interest income of $418.0 million declined 1% compared to the previous quarter and declined 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. Interest income on mortgage and other loans and leases was $380.3 million, down 0.4% on a linked-quarter basis and down 3% on a year-over-year basis. Interest income on securities and money market instruments totaled $37.7 million, down 8% compared to the previous quarter and down 40% compared to the year-ago quarter. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The decline in interest income on loans was the result of lower yields on our loans on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, while average loan balances increased over the same time periods. The decline in interest income on securities on a sequential and year-over-year basis was due to both lower yields and lower balances. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Interest expense totaled $136.2 million, down 13% on a linked quarter basis and down 38% on a year-over-year basis. This was largely due to a decline in our cost of deposits, and to a lesser extent, our cost of borrowings. The cost of interest-bearing deposits declined significantly on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, while the average balance remained relatively unchanged. Most of the decline was in the average cost of CDs. The average cost of borrowings also declined given the drop in market interest rates, while the average balances increased modestly on a year-over-year basis and remained relatively flat sequentially. 

Net Interest Margin 

The direction of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was consistent with that of its net interest income, and generally was driven by the same factors as those described above. At 2.29%, the margin was 11 bps higher than the trailing-quarter measure and 30 bps higher than the margin recorded in the third quarter of last year. 

The following table summarizes the contribution of loan and securities prepayment income on the Company&#8217;s interest income and net interest margin in the periods noted:

&#8220;Adjusted net interest margin&#8221; is a non-GAAP financial measure as more fully discussed below. 

While our net interest margin, including the contribution of prepayment income, is recorded in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net interest margin, which excludes the contribution of prepayment income, is not. Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons: 

&#160;

1. 

Adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. 

&#160;

2. 

Adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers. 

Adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net interest margin, which is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate this non-GAAP measure may differ from that of other companies reporting a non-GAAP measure with a similar name. 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the quarters indicated, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Provision for Credit Losses 

During the third quarter of 2020, the provision for credit losses was $13.0 million compared to $17.6 million during the second quarter and compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for credit losses for the first three quarters of 2020 were calculated using the CECL methodology, while the year-ago provision for credit losses was calculated using the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology. The CECL methodology reflects the impact of a deterioration in forecasted, future economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For additional information about our provisions for and recoveries of loan losses, see the discussion of the allowances for loan losses under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; that appear earlier in this report. 

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212; fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans)&#59; income from our investment in BOLI&#59; gains on the sale of securities&#59; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, total non-interest income was $13.8 million, down 10% and 44%, respectively, compared to the previous and year-ago amounts of $15.4 million and $24.4 million, respectively. Third quarter results reflect a rebound in retail banking income, offset by lower BOLI income. Additionally, the current third quarter included a net loss on securities of $284,000 compared to gains in the previous and year-ago quarters. Results for the third quarter of 2019 included a $7.9 million gain on sale of a branch property in Florida.

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

Non-Interest Expense 

&#160; Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $128.5 million, up 4% compared to the previous and year-ago quarters. Most of the increase during the current third quarter was related to systems conversion-related expenses during the quarter, as well as higher COVID-19-related costs as many of our branches reopened during the quarter and 25% of our back-office personnel returned to their offices. This was partially offset by a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decline in compensation and benefits expense. The efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 2020 was 43.47%, down slightly compared to the previous quarter and compared to 47.37% compared to the year-ago third quarter. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $38.4 million, or up 10% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 and up 16% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The effective tax rate for the current third quarter was 24.89% compared to an effective tax rate of 24.80% for the previous quarter and 25.09% in the year-ago third quarter.

Earnings Summary For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 

In the first nine months of 2020, the Company reported net income of $321.4 million, up 9% compared to the $293.9 million reported for the first nine months of 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $296.8 million, up 10% compared to the $269.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. On a per share basis, the Company reported diluted EPS of $0.63 for the first nine months of 2020, up 11% compared to the $0.57 reported for the first nine months of 2019.

Net Interest Income 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net interest income totaled $792.2 million, up 11% compared to the net interest income we reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. As with the three-month improvement, the improvement in the nine months net interest income amount was primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Interest income of $1.3 billion declined 5% compared to the first nine months of 2019. Interest income on loans and leases of $1.2 billion was relatively unchanged compared to the first nine months of last year, while interest income on securities and money market investments declined $67.1 million or 34% to $128.0 million compared to the first nine months of last year. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Interest expense for the first nine months of 2020 declined $149.6 million or 23% to $489.9 million. This was driven by lower deposit costs as interest expense on deposits declined $140.1 million or 35% to $262.0 million, as the average cost of interest-bearing deposits declined 65 bps to 1.21%, while the average balance remained relatively unchanged. The cost of borrowed funds declined 31 bps to 2.08%, while the average balance of borrowed funds increased 10% to $14.7 billion.

While our net interest margin, including the contribution of prepayment income, is recorded in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net interest margin, which excludes the contribution of prepayment income, is not. Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons: 

&#160;

1. 

Adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. 

&#160;

2. 

Adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers. 

Adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net interest margin, which is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate this non-GAAP measure may differ from that of other companies reporting a non-GAAP measure with a similar name.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the nine-month periods, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Provision for Credit Losses 

On a year-to-date basis, the provision for credit losses totaled $51.2 million compared to a provision for credit losses of $5.4 million for the first nine months of 2019. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2020 was calculated using the CECL methodology which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020, while the provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2019 was calculated using the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology. The CECL methodology reflects the impact of a deterioration in forecasted, future economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212; fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans)&#59; income from our investment in BOLI&#59; gains on the sale of securities&#59; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products.

For the first nine months ended September 30, 2020, total non-interest income declined 31% to $46.0 million compared to $66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decline was driven by the waiver of certain retail banking fees due to COVID-19 and lower net gains on securities, offset modestly by an increase in BOLI income. Results for the first nine months of 2019 also include a $7.9 million gain on sale of a branch property in Florida, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2019.

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:
