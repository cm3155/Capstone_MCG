Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second quarter of 2022 versus the second quarter of 2021, unless otherwise specified. 

Firmwide overview 

For the second quarter of 2022, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $8.6 billion, down 28%, earnings per share of $2.76, an ROE of 13% and ROTCE of 17%. 

&#8226; Total net revenue was up 1%, and reflected: 

&#8211; Net interest income of $15.1 billion, up 19%. Net interest income excluding Markets was $13.7 billion, up 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. 

&#8211; Noninterest revenue was $15.6 billion, down 12%, predominantly driven by: 

&#9702; lower Investment Banking fees, a loss in Credit Adjustments &#38; Other compared to a gain in the prior year, and net losses on equity investments in CIB 

&#9702; lower Card income in CCB, and 

&#9702; $337 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB, 

partially offset by 

&#9702; higher CIB Markets revenue. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense was up 6%, driven by continued investments in the business, including technology and marketing, and higher structural expense, primarily compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, driven by: 

&#8211; a net addition of $428 million to the allowance for credit losses, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, and 

&#8211; $657 million of net charge-offs, down $77 million, driven by Card. 

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $2.3 billion, reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $3.0 billion. 

&#8226; The total allowance for credit losses was $20.0 billion at June 30, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.69%, compared with 2.02% in the prior year. 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled $7.8 billion at June 30, 2022, a net decrease of $2.0 billion from the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance in consumer and net portfolio activity in wholesale. 

&#8226; Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 7%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs. 

&#8226; Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 9%, reflecting the residual impact associated with government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a decline in deposits, including in CB due to migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. 

Selected capital-related metrics 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s CET1 capital was $207 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.2% and 12.9%, respectively. 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s SLR was 5.3%. 

&#8226; The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the second quarter of 2022 at $69.53, up 1% versus the prior year. 

Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a further discussion of each of these measures.

Outlook 

These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 87 and page 155 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s current outlook for 2022 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. 

Full-year 2022 

&#8226; Management expects net interest income excluding Markets to be in excess of $58 billion, market dependent. 

&#8226; Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion, which includes increased investments in technology, distribution and marketing, and higher structural expense. 

&#8226; Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card to be less than 2%. 

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 . 

Business Developments 

War in Ukraine 

The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken steps to close positions and reduce exposures connected with the war, and continues to assist clients with fulfilling or terminating pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks. 

The Firm&#8217;s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, could have adverse effects on the Firm&#8217;s businesses. 

The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks. 

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 62-70, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 71-73, Market Risk Management on pages 75-79, Country Risk Management on pages 80-81 and Operational Risk Management on page 82 for additional information. 

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, &#8220;Russia&#8221; refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm&#8217;s internal country risk management framework; and &#8220;Russia-associated&#8221; refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia. 

Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;IBOR&#8221;) transition

The cessation of the publication of the principal tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June 30, 2023. 

The Firm continues its client outreach with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans and continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments.

Quarterly results 

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting: 

&#8226; lower debt and equity underwriting fees as volatile market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity, and 

&#8226; lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals, starting in the first quarter of 2022. 

Refer to C IB segment results on pages 27-32 and Note 5 for additional information. 

Principal transactions revenue increased primarily in CIB, reflecting: 

&#8226; higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a strong performance in macro businesses amid a volatile market, particularly in Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets, partially offset by lower revenue in Credit and Securitized Products, and 

&#8226; higher revenue in Equity Markets predominantly driven by a strong performance in derivatives amid a volatile market, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; a $218 million loss in Credit Adjustments &#38; Other, largely driven by funding spread widening, compared with a gain of $233 million in the prior year, and 

&#8226; $337 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. 

The increase in Principal transactions revenue also reflected net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year. 

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 

interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis. 

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 27-32, pages 33-36 and pages 41-42, and Note 5 for additional information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of higher deposit-related fees in CCB. 

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. 

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue was relatively flat, reflecting higher asset management fees in AWM resulting from the removal of most money market fund fee waivers, offset by lower market levels and performance fees. Refer to AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. 

Investment securities losses were relatively flat, and reflected losses in both periods from repositioning the investment securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO. R efer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-42 and Note 9 for additional information. 

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to: 

&#8226; lower production revenue from lower margins and volume, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; higher net mortgage servicing revenue resulting from 

&#8211; an increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven by changes in prepayment expectations, and 

&#8211; higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced. 

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26 Note 5 and 14 for additional information. 

Card income decreased reflecting: 

&#8226; higher amortization related to new account origination costs in Card, and 

&#8226; lower net interchange income due to the impact from the renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract in Card in the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Refer to CCB seg ment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. 

Other income de creased reflecting: 

&#8226; net losses on equity investments in CIB compared with net gains in the prior year, and 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB, and 

&#8226; higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments. 

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII, as well as lower NII from PPP loans. 

The Firm&#8217;s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $209 billion, and the yield was 2.22%, up 43 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.80%, an increase of 18 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 2.26%, up 36 bps. 

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 180 for further details. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a further discussion of Net interest yield excluding Markets. 

Year-to-date results

&#8226; lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity, and 

&#8226; lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals. 

Principal transactions revenue decreased reflecting: 

&#8226; a loss of $742 million in Credit Adjustments &#38; Other in CIB, largely driven by funding spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $230 million in the prior year,

&#8211; higher revenue in Equity Markets, driven by a strong performance in prime brokerage and derivatives, partially offset by lower revenue in Cash Equities. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of: 

&#8226; higher deposit-related fees in CCB, and 

&#8226; higher cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by growth in transaction volume. 

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 22-26, pages 27-32 and pages 33-36, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. 

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees in AWM, reflecting strong cumulative net inflows into long-term products, and the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the second quarter of 2022, and net inflows in CCB.

partially offset by

&#8226; higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments in, 

&#8226; a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB, and 

&#8226; the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior year on certain renewable energy investments in CIB. 

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans, as well as lower Markets NII. 

The Firm&#8217;s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $242 billion, and the yield was 2.04%, up 21 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.74%, an increase of 9 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 2.11%, up 19 bps.

Quarterly results 

The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, reflecting $657 million of net charge-offs and a net addition of $428 million to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of: 

&#8226; $238 million in wholesale driven by a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, and loan growth largely in CB, partially offset by client-specific reductions in the allowance for credit losses, and 

&#8226; $184 million in consumer predominantly driven by loan growth in Card. 

Net charge-offs decreased $77 million driven by Card, reflecting the financial strength of U.S. consumers. 

The prior year included a $3.0 billion net red uction in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $734 million. 

Refer to CC B segment results on pages 22-26 , CIB on pages 27-32, CB on pages 33-36, AWM on pages 37-40, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 71-73, and Notes 9 and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results 

The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.3 billion to the allowance for credit losses and $1.2 billion of net charge-offs. The addition to the allowance primarily consisted of: 

&#8226; $1.0 billion in wholesale reflecting the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year due to the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance was also driven by loan growth in CB in the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter of 2022 , and 

&#8226; $311 million in consumer primarily driven by Card, related to loan growth, and Home Lending due to the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2022. 

Net charge-offs decreased $552 million driven by Card, reflecting the financial strength of U.S. consumers. 

Th e prior year included an $8.2 billion net reduction in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $1.8 billion.

Quarterly results 

Compensation expense increased driven by investments and higher structural expense across the LOBs, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB. 

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: 

&#8226; higher investments across the Firm, including marketing and technology, and 

&#8226; higher structural expense, including travel and entertainment, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower volume-related expense, primarily depreciation expense in CCB on lower auto lease assets, and 

&#8226; lower legal expense. 

Year-to-date results 

Compensation expense increased driven by investments and higher structural expense across the LOBs, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB. 

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: 

&#8226; higher investments across the Firm, including marketing and technology, and 

&#8226; higher structural expense, including travel and entertainment and regulatory assessments. The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower volume-related expense, reflecting a net decrease related to lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets and higher operating losses, both in CCB. 

Income tax expense (in millions) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change Income before income tax expense $ 10,865 &#160; $ 15,097 (28) % $ 20,928 &#160; $ 32,794 (36) % Income tax expense 2,216 &#160; 3,149 (30) 3,997 &#160; 6,546 (39) Effective tax rate 20.4 &#160; % 20.9 % 19.1 &#160; % 20.0 % 

Quarterly results 

The effective tax rate decreased driven by the impact of benefits related to tax audit settlements, partially offset by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes. The prior year included expenses related to tax audit settlements. 

Year-to-date results 

The effective tax rate decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by benefits from tax audit settlements, as well as the relative net impact of certain tax benefits and expenses on a lower level of pretax income, partially offset by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes. The prior year included expenses related to tax audit settlements. 

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS 

Consolidated balance sheets analysis 

The following is a discussion of the significant changes between June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 27,215 &#160; $ 26,438 3 % Deposits with banks 642,045 &#160; 714,396 (10) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 322,156 &#160; 261,698 23 Securities borrowed 202,393 &#160; 206,071 (2) Trading assets 465,577 &#160; 433,575 7 Available-for-sale securities 222,069 &#160; 308,525 (28) Held-to-maturity securities, net of allowance for credit losses 441,649 &#160; 363,707 21 Investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses 663,718 &#160; 672,232 (1) Loans 1,104,155 &#160; 1,077,714 2 Allowance for loan losses (17,750) (16,386) 8 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 1,086,405 &#160; 1,061,328 2 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 145,442 &#160; 102,570 42 Premises and equipment 26,770 &#160; 27,070 (1) Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets 59,360 &#160; 56,691 5 Other assets 200,233 &#160; 181,498 10 Total assets $ 3,841,314 &#160; $ 3,743,567 3 % 

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of Markets activities and loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm&#8217;s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks. 

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements in creased driven by Markets, reflecting: 

&#8226; higher collateral requirements, higher demand for securities to cover short positions, and 

&#8226; the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities. 

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements. 

Trading assets increased driven by: 

&#8226; higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements, as well as higher levels of debt instruments, partially offset by lower equity instruments, related to client-driven market-making activities in Markets, and 

&#8226; higher deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO. 

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information. 

Investment securities included the transfer of $73.2 billion of securities from the available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) to the held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) portfolio. 

&#8226; The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, and unrealized losses, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ( &#8220; AOCI &#8221; ), predominantly offset by net purchases. 

&#8226; T he increase in HTM securities was also due to purchases predominantly offset by paydowns. 

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-42, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 74, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information. 

Loans increased , reflecting: 

&#8226; higher loans in CB as a result of higher revolver utilization and originations, 

&#8226; higher retained residential real estate loans in AWM and Home Lending as a result of originations, net of paydowns, 

&#8226; higher balances in Card on higher consumer spending, and 

&#8226; higher wholesale loans in CIB, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and 

&#8226; a decline in CBB due to the impact of PPP loan forgiveness. 

The allowance for loan losses increased as a result of a net addition of $1.4 billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of $1.1 billion in wholesale and $314 million in consumer . The addition reflects the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast . The increase in the allowance for loan losses was also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter of 2022. 

There was a $39 million reduction in the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 55-74, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses. 

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets, including prime brokerage. 

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; higher MSRs as a result of changes in market interest rates and net additions, partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows, and 

&#8226; higher goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Frosch Travel Group, LLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB. 

Refer to Note 14 for additional information. 

Other assets increased largely due to the higher cash collateral placed with counterparties, as well as higher securities financing transactions in Markets. 

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued) (in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Change Liabilities Deposits $ 2,471,544 &#160; $ 2,462,303 &#8212; % Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 222,719 &#160; 194,340 15 Short-term borrowings 58,422 &#160; 53,594 9 Trading liabilities 190,308 &#160; 164,693 16 Accounts payable and other liabilities 313,326 &#160; 262,755 19 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) 10,640 &#160; 10,750 (1) Long-term debt 288,212 &#160; 301,005 (4) Total liabilities 3,555,171 &#160; 3,449,440 3 Stockholders&#8217; equity 286,143 &#160; 294,127 (3) Total liabilities and stockholders&#8217; equity $ 3,841,314 &#160; $ 3,743,567 3 % 

Deposits were relatively flat, reflecting: 

&#8226; growth in new accounts in CCB that more than offset the decline in deposits in existing accounts across consumer and small business customers, as consumer spending continued to grow , and 

&#8226; higher deposits in Securities Services and Payments primarily driven by client activities, 

offset by 

&#8226; a decline in CB due to the migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives; and additionally, in AWM and CB reflecting seasonality. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information. 

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements in creased due to: 

&#8226; higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 and Note 10 for additional information. 

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher net issuance of commercial paper primarily for short-term liquidity management in Treasury and CIO . Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 for additional information. 

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt instruments. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information. 

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due to higher client payables related to client-driven activities primarily in Markets, including prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities financing transactions. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional information on Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs , specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts. 

Long-term debt decreased driven by fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO related to higher rates, and a decline in the fair value of structured notes in CIB. These were largely offset by net issuances in Treasury and CIO and CIB . Refe r to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 for additional information. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity decreased as a result of a net unrealized loss in AOCI, which was predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Capital actions on page 48, Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders&#8217; equity on page 91, and Note 19 for a dditional information.

&#8226; Firmwide &#8220;managed&#8221; basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (&#8220;FTE&#8221; basis); 

&#8226; Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense; 

&#8226; Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding Markets; 

&#8226; TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; 

&#8226; Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments &#8211; Consumer &#38; Community Banking, Corporate &#38; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. 

The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm&#8217;s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis. 

Description of business segment reporting methodology 

Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm&#8217;s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. 

Revenue sharing 

When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm&#8217;s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. 

Funds transfer pricing 

Funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. 

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. 

Foreign exchange risk 

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. 

Capital allocation 

The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 47, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. 

Refer to Business Segment Results &#8211; Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.

(c) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

Quarterly results 

Net income was $3.1 billion, down 45%, reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $12.6 billion, a decrease of 1%. 

Net interest income was $8.7 billion, up 8%, driven by: 

&#8226; growth in deposits in CBB, and higher revolving loans in Card, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB, and lower NII in Home Lending primarily due to tighter loan spreads. 

Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, down 17%, driven by: 

&#8226; lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to new account origination costs and lower net interchange income due to the impact from the renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract in the fourth quarter of 2021, 

&#8226; lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending, and 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher net mortgage servicing revenue from an increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven by changes in prepayment expectations, and higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced, and 

&#8226; higher deposit-related fees. 

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income. 

Noninterest expense was $7.7 billion, up 9%, reflecting: 

&#8226; investments in the business and increased structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and marketing, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower volume- and revenue-related expenses primarily due to depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets. 

The provision for credit losses was $761 million, reflecting: 

&#8226; net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million, driven by Card reflecting the financial strength of U.S. consumers, and 

&#8226; a $150 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in Card driven by loan growth. 

The prior year included a $2.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 55-74 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 71-73 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results 

Net income was $6.0 billion, down 52%, reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $24.8 billion, a decrease of 2%. 

Net interest income was $17.0 billion, up 7%, driven by: 

&#8226; growth in deposits net of margin compression in CBB, and higher revolving loans in Card, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB, and lower NII in Home Lending primarily due to tighter loan spreads. 

Noninterest revenue was $7.8 billion, down 16%, driven by: 

&#8226; lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending, 

&#8226; higher amortization related to new account origination costs in Card, and 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher net mortgage servicing revenue from an increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven by changes in prepayment expectations, and higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced, 

&#8226; higher commissions largely on travel, and higher asset management fees as a result of net inflows, and 

&#8226; higher deposit-related fees. 

Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, up 8%, reflecting: 

&#8226; investments in the business and increased structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and marketing, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, reflecting a net decrease related to lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets and higher operating losses. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, reflecting: 

&#8226; net charge-offs of $1.2 billion, down $591 million, driven by Card reflecting the financial strength of U.S. consumers, and 

&#8226; a $275 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in Card and Home Lending. 

The prior year included a $7.2 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

(a) At June 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $257 million and $397 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm&#8217;s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. 

(b) At June 30, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit. 

(c) At June 30, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded $86 million of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA. 

(d) At June 30, 2022 and 2021, included $1.5 billion and $16.7 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.

Quarterly results 

Net income was $3.7 billion, down 26%. 

Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 10%. 

Banking revenue was $3.2 billion, down 37%. 

&#8226; Investment Banking revenue was $1.4 billion, down 61%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, down 54%, reflecting lower fees across products, and $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. 

&#8211; Debt underwriting fees were $741 million, down 53%, and E quity underwriting fees were $245 million, down 77%, as volatile market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity. 

&#8211; Advisory fees were $664 million, down 28%, driven by a lower level of announced deals starting in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1%, and included markdowns on equity investments. Excluding these markdowns, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 25%, predominantly driven by improved deposit margins and fees. 

&#8226; Lending revenue was $410 million, up 79%, driven by fair value gains on hedges of accrual loans, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher net interest income on higher loans. 

Markets &#38; Securities Services revenue was $8.7 billion, up 8%. Markets revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15%. 

&#8226; Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.7 billion, up 15%, driven by a strong performance in macro businesses amid a volatile market, particularly in Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets, partially offset by lower revenue in Credit and Securitized Products. 

&#8226; Equity Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, up 15%, driven by a strong performance in derivatives amid a volatile market. 

&#8226; Securities Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6%, predominantly driven by growth in fees, and to a lesser extent improved deposit margins, partially offset by lower market levels. 

&#8226; Credit Adjustments &#38; Other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening, compared with a gain of $233 million in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $6.7 billion, up 3%, reflecting higher structural expense and investments in the business, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. 

The provision for credit losses was $59 million, driven by an addition to the allowance for credit losses, associated with a modest deterioration in the Firm&#8217;s macroeconomic forecast, predominantly offset by client-specific reductions in the allowance for credit losses. 

The prior year was a net benefit of $79 million. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 55-74 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 71-73 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results 

Net income was $8.1 billion, down 26%. 

Net revenue was $25.5 billion, down 8%. 

Banking revenue was $7.5 billion, down 22%. 

&#8226; Investment Banking revenue was $3.4 billion, down 46%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, down 44%, reflecting lower fees across products, and $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in the second quarter of 2022 . The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. 

&#8211; Equity underwriting fees were $494 million, down 77%, and Debt underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, down 39%, as volatile market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity. 

&#8211; Advisory fees were $1.5 billion, down 8%, driven by a lower level of announced deals. 

&#8226; Payments revenue was $3.3 billion, up 17%, driven by improved deposit margins, as well as higher fees and deposits. 

&#8226; Lending revenue was $731 million, up 48%, driven by fair value gains on hedges of accrual loans, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher net interest income on higher loans. 

Markets &#38; Securities Services revenue was $18.0 billion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $16.5 billion, up 4%. 

&#8226; Fixed Income Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, up 6%, driven by higher revenue in macro businesses particularly in Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets, largely offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products and Credit. 

&#8226; Equity Markets revenue was $6.1 billion, up 3%, predominantly driven by a strong performance in derivatives and prime brokerage, partially offset by lower revenue in Cash Equities. 

&#8226; Securities Services revenue was $2.2 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by growth in fees and improved deposit margins, partially offset by lower market levels. 

&#8226; Credit Adjustments &#38; Other was a loss of $742 million, predominantly driven by funding spread widening, and to a lesser extent losses on exposure relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $230 million in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $14.0 billion, up 3%, predominantly driven by higher structural expense, investments in the business and legal expense, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense including revenue-related compensation. 

The provision for credit losses was $504 million, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios and a modest deterioration in the Firm&#8217;s macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance also included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in the first quarter of 2022. 

The prior year was a net benefit of $410 million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue 

The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information. 

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results 

Net income was $994 million, down 30%, reflecting a net increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $2.7 billion, up 8% compared to the prior year. Net interest income was $1.8 billion, up 16%, driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth in loans, largely offset by the impact of higher funding costs. 

Noninterest revenue was $904 million, down 5%, driven by: 

&#8226; lower investment banking revenue and markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, 

predominantly offset by 

&#8226; a gain on an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan and higher payments revenue. 

Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, up 18%, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume- and revenue-related expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $209 million, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, largely driven by loan growth, compared with a net benefit of $377 million in the prior year. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 55-74 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 71-73 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

&#8226; higher asset management fees reflecting the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the second quarter of 2022, and strong cumulative net inflows into 

long-term products, partially offset by the decline in market levels, and 

&#8226; higher performance fees, 

predominantly offset by 

&#8226; investment valuation net losses compared to net gains in the prior year. 

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $4.2 billion, up 11%, driven by: 

&#8226; higher loans and wider spreads, and 

&#8226; growth in deposits, net of margin compression, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower brokerage fees on reduced volume, and 

&#8226; lower performance fees. 

Noninterest expense was $5.8 billion, up 12%, driven by higher structural expense and investments in the business, including compensation, and higher volume- and revenue-related expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $198 million, driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net benefit of $131 million in the prior year.

Quarterly results 

Net loss was $174 million, compared with a net loss of $1.3 billion in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income predominantly due to higher rates, including the impact of slower prepayments. 

Noninterest revenue decreased driven by: 

&#8226; the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on certain revenues, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and 

&#8226; net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment related to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; net gains on certain legacy private equity investments, compared with net losses in the prior year, and 

&#8226; higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments. 

Noninterest expense of $206 million was down $309 million driven by: 

&#8226; lower structural expense, including the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on certain expenses, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, as well as lower technology expense, and 

&#8226; lower legal expense, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives. 

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the f oreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income. 

The current period income tax expense was driven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves, largely offset by the resolution of tax audits. 

Year-to-date results 

Net loss was $1.0 billion, compared with a net loss of $2.1 billion in the prior year. 

Net revenue was a loss of $801 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, including the impact of slower prepayments. 

Noninterest revenue decreased driven by: 

&#8226; higher net investment securities losses related to the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios in both periods, 

&#8226; the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, 

&#8226; net losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net gains in prior year, and 

&#8226; net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment related to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022, and 

&#8226; higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments. 

Noninterest expense of $390 million was down $1.0 billion driven by: 

&#8226; lower structural expense reflecting the absence of the contribution to the Firm's Foundation recorded in the prior year, the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, as well as lower technology expense, and 

&#8226; lower legal expense, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives. 

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the f oreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income. 

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes and the resolution of tax audits. 

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first quarter of 2022.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm&#8217;s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: 

&#8226; Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 

&#8226; Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

&#8226; Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm&#8217;s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework 

The Firm&#8217;s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. 

Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. 

Risk governance and oversight functions 

The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2021 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm&#8217;s business activities.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm&#8217;s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. 

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm&#8217;s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website, for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s capital risk. 

Basel III Overview 

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (&#8220;Basel III Standardized&#8221;), and an advanced approach (&#8220;Basel III Advanced&#8221;). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm&#8217;s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. The Firm&#8217;s SLR is currently more binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to SLR on page 47 for additional information. 

Key Regulatory Developments 

CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition provisions , which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance. 

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted &#8220;Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk&#8221; (&#8220;SA-CCR&#8221;), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm&#8217;s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized. 

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 

The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 12.5% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. This target is based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect, and taking into account the expected increase in the Firm's Stress Capital Buffer (&#8220;SCB&#8221;) requirement. 

The following tables present the Firm&#8217;s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm&#8217;s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s liquidity risk. 

LCR and HQLA 

The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm&#8217;s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm&#8217;s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. 

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021 based on the Firm&#8217;s interpretation of the LCR framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. 

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule. 

(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets. 

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared with the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA primarily from a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in the market value of HQLA-eligible investment securities in 

Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding gross unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities portfolio. 

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources 

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm&#8217;s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $826 billion and $914 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. 

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLBs&#8221;) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $308 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm&#8217;s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of &#8220;available&#8221; stable funding that is sufficient to meet their &#8220;required&#8221; amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. 

As of June 30, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in 2023. 

Funding 

Sources of funds 

Management believes that the Firm&#8217;s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements. 

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders&#8217; equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured 

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding Company (&#8220;IHC&#8221;). The Firm&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm&#8217;s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. 

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm&#8217;s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. 

Average deposits increased for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting the residual impact associated with government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a decline in deposits, including in CB due to migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. 

Average deposits increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs resulting from the residual effect of certain government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. 

Increases in Corporate predominantly relate to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

Short-term funding 

The Firm&#8217;s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO. 

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm&#8217;s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm&#8217;s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. 

The Firm&#8217;s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in commercial paper at June 30, 2022, from December 31, 2021, and for the average three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year period, was due to higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management. 

Long-term funding and issuance 

Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm&#8217;s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm&#8217;s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

The Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations. 

Credit ratings 

The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. 

Additionally, the Firm&#8217;s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements. 

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm&#8217;s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2022, were as follows: 

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

(a) Moody&#8217;s outlook for the Parent Company&#8217;s long-term and short-term issuer rating is positive and stable, respectively. 

(b) In January 2022, the three rating agencies affirmed the credit ratings of J.P. Morgan SE, which are equivalent to the ratings previously assigned to J.P. Morgan SE's predecessors, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. and J.P. Morgan AG. 

Refer to page 104 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could affect the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm&#8217;s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries.

These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates. 

Consumer, excluding credit card 

Portfolio analysis 

Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real estate loans. 

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. 

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021, reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance. Net recoveries for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were lower when compared with the same period in the prior year as the current year recoveries were impacted by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. Net recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were relatively flat compared with the same period in the prior year. 

Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as Home Lending warehouse loan sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and lower loan purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by CIB. 

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.9 billion at June 30, 2022. This amount included $5.5 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5.5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. 

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $34.4 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2022 on a loan sale and net recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. 

The following table provides a summary of the Firm&#8217;s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm&#8217;s residential real estate loans. 

Modified residential real estate loans 

The following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

(in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Retained loans $ 12,185 &#160; $ 13,251 

Nonaccrual retained loans (a) 

$ 3,543 &#160; $ 3,938 

(a) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans included $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status. 

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 predominantly due to a decrease in business banking loans driven by PPP loan forgiveness. Scored auto portfolio loans decreased driven by paydowns predominantly offset by loan originations. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 increased when compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and scored auto charge-offs partially offset by lower scored business banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off and net recovery rates were 0.12% and (0.11)% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and net charge-off rates of 0.15% and 0.00% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the net recovery for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2021 benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs.

Credit card 

Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 reflecting higher consumer spending. The June 30, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.05% and 0.51%, respectively, were relatively flat compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%. Net charge-offs decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared with the same period in the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the financial strength of U.S. consumers. 

Consistent with the Firm&#8217;s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies. 

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans 

Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm&#8217;s credit card loans. 

Modifications of credit card loans 

At June 30, 2022, the Firm had $827 million of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers. 

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 64-67 for further information. 

The Firm&#8217;s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. 

In the six months ended June 30, 2022, credit continued to perform well with charge-offs at historically low levels. As of June 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming exposure was driven by a decline in lending related commitments as a result of net portfolio activity, predominantly in CIB, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming derivatives. Nonperforming loans were relatively flat and included paydowns on exposures to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients that were downgraded in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 and Country Risk on pages 80-81 for additional information. 

As of June 30, 2022, retained loans increased $23.9 billion driven by CB and CIB, partially offset by decreases in AWM.

(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 

Wholesale credit exposure &#8211; industry exposures 

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion and $38.2 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, with the largest decreases in Consumer &#38; Retail and Technology, Media &#38; Telecommunications. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at June 30, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.3 billion was performing. 

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm&#8217;s exposures as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty&#8217;s primary business activity.

Real Estate 

Real Estate exposure was $165.5 billion as of June 30, 2022, of which $95.2 billion was multifamily lending as shown in the table below. Criticized exposure decreased by $913 million from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021 to $4.3 billion at June 30, 2022, driven by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio activity largely offset by client-specific downgrades.

Loans 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators. 

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Since June 30, 2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $924 million driven by net portfolio activity, largely in Real Estate and Oil &#38; Gas, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022, some of which paid down their loans in the second quarter of 2022.

Lending-related commitments 

The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm&#8217;s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments. 

Receivables from customers 

Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients&#8217; brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets. 

Derivative contracts 

Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (&#8220;ETD&#8221;), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC-cleared&#8221;) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (&#8220;CCP&#8221;). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. 

The percentage of the Firm&#8217;s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements &#8212; excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily &#8212; was approximately 87% and 88% at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. 

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $81.3 billion and $57.1 billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was driven by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. 

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client&#8217;s exposure is in the Firm&#8217;s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. 

In management&#8217;s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. 

The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. 

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client&#8217;s derivative contracts move in the Firm&#8217;s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s use of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities 

The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm&#8217;s own credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: 

&#8226; the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm&#8217;s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, 

&#8226; the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and 

&#8226; the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

Discussion of changes in the allowance 

The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2022 was $20.0 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $1.0 billion in wholesale and $311 million in consumer. 

The change in allowance reflects the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance was also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter of 2022. 

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates above 4% through the fourth quarter of 2023, and a 1.1% lower U.S. real GDP level exiting the fourth quarter of 2023. 

The Firm&#8217;s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: 

Assumptions at June 30, 2022 4Q22 2Q23 4Q23 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

3.6 % 3.6 % 3.7 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

1.3 % 1.7 % 1.2 % Assumptions at December 31, 2021 2Q22 4Q22 2Q23 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

4.2 % 4.0 % 3.9 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

3.1 % 2.8 % 2.1 % 

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. 

(b) As of June 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. 

Investment securities risk 

Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $661.9 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-42 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 75-79 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. 

Principal investment risk 

Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm&#8217;s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm&#8217;s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm&#8217;s investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm&#8217;s commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. 

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Refer to page 132 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. 

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm&#8217;s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. 

Value-at-risk 

JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. 

The Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (&#8220;Regulatory VaR&#8221;), which is used to derive the Firm&#8217;s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm&#8217;s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm&#8217;s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm&#8217;s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals. 

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages 138-140 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm. 

The table below shows the results of the Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. 

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures. 

(c) During the period ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR. During the period ended June 30, 2022, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related exposure, although average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated when compared to the prior year period. 

(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded. 

(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful. 

Quarter over quarter results 

Average total VaR decreased by $9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 when compared with March 31, 2022 due to decreases in Credit Portfolio VaR predominantly driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure, largely offset by increased market volatility impacting Fixed income. 

Year over year results 

Average total VaR increased by $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was largely driven by market volatility impacting Fixed income as well as increases in Credit Portfolio VaR due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market observed in March 2022. 

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

VaR backtesting 

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm&#8217;s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. 

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. 

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 148 of the 261 days, and observed 22 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 37 of the 65 days, and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions. 

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm&#8217;s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm&#8217;s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk 

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm&#8217;s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm&#8217;s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm&#8217;s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. 

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm&#8217;s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (&#8220;non-U.S. dollar&#8221; currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: 

&#8226; The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. 

&#8226; Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing. 

&#8226; The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors. 

The Firm&#8217;s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm&#8217;s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm&#8217;s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm&#8217;s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information). 

The Firm&#8217;s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. 

(in billions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ (1.4) $ 5.0 -100 bps shift in rates (1.0) NM (a) 

Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.5 &#160; 1.8 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.4) NM (a) 

Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates (1.8) 3.2 -100 bps shift in long-term rates (0.6) NM (a) 

(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. 

The change in the Firm&#8217;s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm&#8217;s baseline for higher rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet. 

As of June 30, 2022, the Firm&#8217;s sensitivity to the +100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a +100 basis points shift in long-term rates and the -100 basis points shift in rates are primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing. 

The Firm&#8217;s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. 

(in billions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.9 &#160; $ 0.8 -100 bps shift in rates (0.8) NM (a) 

Steeper yield curve: -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.8) NM (a) 

Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.8 &#160; 0.8 

(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. 

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm&#8217;s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . 

Other sensitivity-based measures 

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. 

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management&#8217;s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm&#8217;s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm&#8217;s exposures are diversified given the Firm&#8217;s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. 

Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s country risk management. 

Sources and measurement 

The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. 

Under the Firm&#8217;s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation. 

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm&#8217;s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). 

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure. 

Under the Firm&#8217;s internal country risk measurement framework: 

&#8226; Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received 

&#8226; Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with central and commercial banks 

&#8226; Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received 

&#8226; Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions 

&#8226; Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative&#8217;s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received 

&#8226; Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable; reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures 

The Firm&#8217;s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. 

Risk Reporting 

The following table presents the Firm&#8217;s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm&#8217;s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm&#8217;s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm&#8217;s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. 

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities. 

The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia, largely due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits following recent interest rate increases. 

As of June 30, 2022, exposure to Russia, based on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework, was approximately $600 million.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events impacting the Firm&#8217;s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm&#8217;s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm&#8217;s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s Operational Risk Management. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below. 

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance programs. To manage this increased risk, the Firm implemented additional controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations. 

Business and technology resiliency risk 

Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm&#8217;s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. 

Cybersecurity Risk 

The Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber attacks due to potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm implemented additional precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity breaches will provide absolute security against cyber attacks. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm&#8217;s most complex accounting estimates require management&#8217;s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm&#8217;s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. 

Allowance for credit losses 

The Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm&#8217;s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: 

&#8226; The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm&#8217;s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), 

&#8226; The allowance for lending-related commitments, and 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. 

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm&#8217;s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 71-73 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. 

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm&#8217;s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. 

&#8226; Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP. 

&#8226; Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. 

Changes in the Firm&#8217;s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. 

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. 

For example, compared to the Firm&#8217;s central scenario shown on page 71 and in Note 12, the Firm&#8217;s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher 

over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 

approximately 3.7% in the second quarter of 2023; lower 

U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 

2.9% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a 

peak difference of approximately 5.8% in the second 

quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak 

difference of 17.6% in the first quarter of 2024. 

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: 

&#8226; The allowance as of June 30, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. 

&#8226; The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 

&#8226; Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2022, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $600 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $2.0 billion for credit card loans 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $3.0 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments 

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2022. 

Fair value 

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. 

Assets measured at fair value 

The following table includes the Firm&#8217;s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $8.9 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 

Valuation 

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. 

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. 

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm&#8217;s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. 

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm&#8217;s businesses and portfolios.

Reference Rate 

Reform 

Issued March 

2020 and updated January 2021 

&#8226; Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and other transactions are amended due to reference rate reform. 

&#8226; Provides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to reference rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the requirement to assess the significance of the amendments. 

&#8226; Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge accounting relationship without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides various practical expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted during the transition period. 

&#8226; Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met. 

&#8226; The January 2021 update provides an election to account for derivatives modified to change the rate used for discounting, margining, or contract price alignment (collectively &#8220;discounting transition&#8221;) as modifications. 

&#8226; Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021 update was effective when issued. 

&#8226; The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships, and discounting transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting transition election was applied retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging &#8211; Portfolio Layer Method 

Issued March 2022

&#8226; Required effective date: January 1, 2023. (a) 

&#8226; The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Firm's planned date of adoption.

Issued March 2022 

&#8226; Eliminates existing accounting and disclosure requirements for Troubled Debt Restructurings, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow methodology.

&#8226; Requires disclosure of current period loan charge-off information by origination year. 

&#8226; May be adopted prospectively, or by using a modified retrospective method wherein the effect of adoption is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date.

&#8226; The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

Note 1 &#8211; Basis of presentation 

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221;), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s business segments. 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. 

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. 

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. 

Consolidation 

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. 

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s accounting policies regarding consolidation. 

Offsetting assets and liabilities 

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. 

Note 2 &#8211; Fair value measurement 

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

(a) At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 70.0 billion and $ 73.9 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related. 

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. &#8220;Net realizable value&#8221; is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (&#8220;transaction costs&#8221;). Transaction costs for the Firm&#8217;s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm&#8217;s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. 

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). 

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 856 million and $ 801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $ 45 million and $ 51 million, respectively, and other assets of $ 811 million and $ 750 million, respectively. 

(e) At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $ 13.5 billion and $ 26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 7.7 billion and $ 8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 4.4 billion and $ 13.6 billion, respectively. 

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 

Level 3 valuations 

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm&#8217;s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. 

The following table presents the Firm&#8217;s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. 

In the Firm&#8217;s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm&#8217;s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. 

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 803 million, nonagency securities of $ 14 million and non-trading loans of $ 914 million. 

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 10 million, trading loans of $ 40 million and non-trading loans of $ 368 million. 

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 858 million and non-trading loans of $ 738 million. 

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. 

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 918 million including $ 257 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. 

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100 . 

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. 

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used. 

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm&#8217;s positions. 

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 

The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm&#8217;s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis 

Consolidated balance sheets changes 

The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2021, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 106 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

Three and six months ended June 30, 2022 

Level 3 assets were $ 22.3 billion at June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of $ 329 million from March 31, 2022, and an increase of $ 4.8 billion from December 31, 2021. 

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was largely driven by: 

&#8226; $ 1.6 billion increase in gross derivative receivables due to gains and purchases largely offset by net transfers. 

&#8226; $ 1.9 billion increase in MSRs. 

Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. 

Refer to the sections below for additional information. 

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: 

&#8226; $ 930 million of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: 

&#8226; $ 1.6 billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely due to equity securities of $ 959 million driven by a decrease in observability predominantly as a result of restricted access to certain markets. 

&#8226; $ 1.3 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: 

&#8226; $ 965 million of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

&#8226; $ 920 million and $ 1.4 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2021, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: 

&#8226; $ 1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: 

&#8226; $ 800 million of total debt and equity instruments, largely trading loans, driven by an increase in observability. 

&#8226; $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. 

Gains and losses 

The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm&#8217;s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 99-104 for further information on these instruments. 

Three months ended June 30, 2022 

&#8226; $ 3.4 billion of net gains on assets, largely driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. 

&#8226; $ 2.8 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by gains in long-term debt due to market movements. 

Three months ended June 30, 2021 

&#8226; $ 1.3 billion of net losses on assets, driven by losses in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. 

&#8226; $ 468 million of net losses on liabilities, driven by losses in long-term debt partially offset by gains in short-term borrowings, due to market movements. 

Six months ended June 30, 2022 

&#8226; $ 5.5 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. 

&#8226; $ 5.0 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by gains in long-term debt due to market movements. 

Six months ended June 30, 2021 

&#8226; $ 282 million of net losses on assets, driven by losses in net derivative receivables due to market movements largely offset by gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. 

Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $ 1.1 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2022, $ 985 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. 

(b) Of the $ 665 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2022, $ 55 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker&#8217;s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm&#8217;s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 12 % to 56 % with a weighted average of 23 %. 

Nonrecurring fair value changes

Refer to Note 11 for further information about the measurement of collateral-dependent loans. 

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. 

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm&#8217;s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm&#8217;s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. 

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan&#8217;s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan&#8217;s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 

The majority of the Firm&#8217;s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees. 

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments. 

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 171 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. 

Note 3 &#8211; Fair value option 

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. 

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. 

The Firm&#8217;s election of fair value includes the following instruments: 

&#8226; Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments 

&#8226; Certain securities financing agreements 

&#8226; Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument 

&#8226; Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities 

&#8226; Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB&#8217;s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value 

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election 

The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $( 9 ) million and $( 2 ) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. 

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. 

(d) Reported in other income. 

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. 

(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding 

The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. 

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. 

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm&#8217;s next call date. 

At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $ 10.0 billion and $ 11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $ 30 million and $ 10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 &#8211; Derivative instruments 

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. 

The Firm&#8217;s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm&#8217;s derivatives are designated in hedge 

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm&#8217;s market-making businesses or for other purposes. 

The following table outlines the Firm&#8217;s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm&#8217;s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm&#8217;s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further information. 

(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 

Derivatives netting 

The following tables present, as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. 

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm&#8217;s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: 

&#8226; collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as &#8220;Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets&#8221; in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 

&#8226; the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and 

&#8226; collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. 

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features 

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm&#8217;s derivative contracts. 

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

$ 16,037 &#160; $ 20,114 &#160; Collateral posted 14,926 &#160; 19,402 &#160; 

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset 

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 

(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. 

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. 

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. 

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. 

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 

(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 22.2 billion and $ 25.7 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. 

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 15.7 billion and $ 14.0 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 224 million and $ 9.7 billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. 

(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. 

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships. 

Cash flow hedge gains and losses 

The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item &#8211; primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. 

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.1 ) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately eight years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years . The Firm&#8217;s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 

Net investment hedge gains and losses

Credit derivatives 

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm&#8217;s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

0.63 &#160; % 0.69 &#160; % 1.56 &#160; % 2.73 &#160; % 1.73 &#160; % 

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. 

(b) Substantially all of the Firm&#8217;s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, seven years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 

Note 10 &#8211; Securities financing activities 

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. 

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm&#8217;s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 

such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting 

At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $ 342 million and $ 440 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 11 &#8211; Loans 

Loan accounting framework 

The accounting for a loan depends on management&#8217;s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: 

&#8226; Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., &#8220;retained&#8221;) 

&#8226; Loans held-for-sale 

&#8226; Loans at fair value 

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. 

Loan portfolio 

The Firm&#8217;s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. 

Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale (c)(d) 

&#8226; Residential real estate (a) 

&#8226; Auto and other (b) 

&#8226; Credit card loans &#8226; Secured by real estate 

&#8226; Commercial and industrial 

&#8226; Other (e) 

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate. 

(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts. 

(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. 

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. 

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs. 

The following tables summarize the Firm&#8217;s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(a) Excludes $ 3.2 billion and $ 2.7 billion of accrued interest receivables at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm wrote off accrued interest receivables of $ 8 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 20 million and $ 21 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm&#8217;s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) guidelines for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. 

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $ 6.0 billion and $ 5.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 9.2 billion and $ 12.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm&#8217;s standards. 

Gains and losses on sales of loans 

Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was $( 352 ) million and $( 314 ) million, respectively, of which $( 67 ) million and $( 32 ) million, respectively, related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was $ 62 million and $ 194 million, respectively, of which $ 47 million and $ 182 million, respectively, related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. 

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio 

Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. 

The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $ 30 million and $ 35 million; 30&#8211;149 days past due included $ 11 million for both periods; and 150 or more days past due included $ 21 million and $ 20 million, respectively. 

(b) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. 

(c) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $ 32 million and $ 31 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated. 

Approximately 37 % of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period. 

Nonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators

$ 237,142 &#160; $ 224,795 &#160; 

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;Chapter 7 loans&#8221;) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2022, approximately 5 % of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due. 

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. 

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45 million and $ 41 million and $ 90 million and $ 86 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. 

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower&#8217;s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. 

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management&#8217;s estimation of the borrower&#8217;s credit quality. 

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available. 

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2022. 

(k) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $ 62 million and $ 66 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee. 

Loan modifications 

Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 115 million and $ 307 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 233 million and $ 558 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. 

Nature and extent of modifications 

The Firm&#8217;s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm&#8217;s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100 % because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. 

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR. 

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults 

The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. 

At June 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years . The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). 

Active and suspended foreclosure 

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 696 million and $ 619 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $ 86 million and $ 506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $ 81 million and $ 35 million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative. 

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 . 

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2022. 

Loan modifications 

Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. 

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not material. 

Credit card loan portfolio 

The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans.

Loan modifications 

The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm&#8217;s long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. 

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm&#8217;s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower&#8217;s line of credit. 

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults 

The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1 % of total retained credit card loans.

(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. 

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm&#8217;s standard charge-off policy. 

Wholesale loan portfolio 

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these risk ratings. 

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. 

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Loan modifications 

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. New TDRs were $ 60 million and $ 224 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively and $ 479 million and $ 652 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New TDRs for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. New TDRs for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected modifications that included extending maturity dates and covenant waivers for both periods as well as the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021 predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial loan class . The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The carrying value of TDRs was $ 852 million and $ 607 million as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Note 12 &#8211; Allowance for credit losses

Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans&#8217; original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. 

(b) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

(c) At June 30, 2022 and 2021, lending-related commitments excluded $ 13.7 billion and $ 20.8 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 774.0 billion and $ 682.5 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 38.7 billion and $ 42.7 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. 

Discussion of changes in the allowance 

The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2022 was $ 20.0 billion, an increase of $ 1.3 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $ 1.0 billion in wholesale and $ 311 million in consumer. 

The change in allowance reflects the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance was also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter of 2022. 

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates above 4% through the fourth quarter of 2023, and a 1.1% lower U.S. real GDP level exiting the fourth quarter of 2023. 

The Firm&#8217;s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: 

Assumptions at June 30, 2022 4Q22 2Q23 4Q23 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

3.6 % 3.6 % 3.7 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

1.3 % 1.7 % 1.2 % Assumptions at December 31, 2021 2Q22 4Q22 2Q23 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

4.2 % 4.0 % 3.9 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

3.1 % 2.8 % 2.1 % 

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. 

(b) As of June 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. 

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm&#8217;s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs 

Credit card securitizations 

As a result of the Firm&#8217;s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. 

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts 

The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. 

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit 

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm&#8217;s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm&#8217;s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits 

In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 12.1 billion and $ 13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm&#8217;s investments reflect the Firm&#8217;s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. 

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 13.1 billion and $ 13.4 billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 

Municipal bond vehicles 

Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (&#8220;TOB&#8221;) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. 

The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, &#8220;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs&#8221;. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

VIEs sponsored by third parties 

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm&#8217;s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. 

Tax credit vehicles 

The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing 

member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 27.5 billion and $ 26.8 billion, of which $ 9.8 billion and $ 9.4 billion was unfunded at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 

The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. 

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 6.9 billion and $ 6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 9.4 billion and $ 10.5 billion, respectively. 

Loan securitizations 

The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, and commercial mortgages. 

Securitization activity 

The following table provides information related to the Firm&#8217;s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 

Ginnie Mae guidelines 

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share 

a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm&#8217;s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm&#8217;s sale of certain excess MSRs. 

The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans 

In addition to the Firm&#8217;s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 

Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm&#8217;s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. 

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights.

(a) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, represents estimated goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Frosch Travel Group, LLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB. 

(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments and, in 2021, adjustments to goodwill related to prior period acquisitions. 

Goodwill impairment testing 

Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s goodwill impairment testing. 

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm&#8217;s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. 

As of June 30, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was no t impaired as of June 30, 2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021. 

Mortgage servicing rights 

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. 

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. 

(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm&#8217;s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. 

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm&#8217;s MSRs at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Note 21 &#8211; Regulatory capital 

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. 

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm&#8217;s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators. 

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. 

(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5 % as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.2 % SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5 % capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0 % by the federal banking agencies. 

(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 % that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. 

(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. 

(d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. 

The following table presents the leverage-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

CECL regulatory capital transition 

On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition provisions , which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining $ 2.2 billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. 

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 22 &#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related 

financial instruments, guarantees, and other 

commitments 

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm&#8217;s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm&#8217;s related accounting policies. 

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. 

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions. 

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 

The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. 

Merchant charge-backs 

Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder&#8217;s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder&#8217;s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs. 

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications 

In connection with the Firm&#8217;s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. 

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. 

Sponsored member repo program 

The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&#8220;FICC&#8221;) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC&#8217;s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients&#8217; respective obligations under the FICC&#8217;s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm&#8217;s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &#38; clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 170. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. 

Guarantees of subsidiaries 

The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (&#8220;JPMFC&#8221;), a 100 %-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm&#8217;s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 170 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Note 23 &#8211; Pledged assets and collateral

Collateral 

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 &#8211; Litigation 

Contingencies 

As of June 30, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm&#8217;s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. 

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0 to approximately $ 1.2 billion at June 30, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm&#8217;s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: 

&#8226; the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, 

&#8226; the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, 

&#8226; the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 

&#8226; the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. 

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm&#8217;s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. 

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm&#8217;s material legal proceedings. 

Amrapali . India&#8217;s Enforcement Directorate (&#8220;ED&#8221;) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (&#8220;Amrapali&#8221;). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers&#8217; petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India&#8217;s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (&#8220;PMLA&#8221;) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. 

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (&#8220;FGN&#8221;) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $ 1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (&#8220;FRN&#8221;) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately $ 75 million. 

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (&#8220;FX&#8221;) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 

guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) until January 2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. 

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm&#8217;s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10 million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the tribunal has denied a request by the proposed class representatives for class certification on an opt-out basis. 

Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In December 2021 certain of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) to resolve their respective civil investigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping rules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. 

Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $ 75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. 

In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm&#8217;s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws based on the Board&#8217;s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. 

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. 

The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900 million to the approximately $ 5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court&#8217;s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. 

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association&#8217;s (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation&#8217;s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;). The Swiss Competition Commission&#8217;s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. 

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs&#8217; complaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs&#8217; motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm&#8217;s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. 

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), which, collectively, resolved those agencies&#8217; respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. 

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (&#8220;DPA&#8221;) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan 

Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years , provided that JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. 

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920 million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. 

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to precious metals. 

In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. 

In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the Firm. The complaint claims the Firm&#8217;s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the shareholder&#8217;s demand to commence litigation and seeks 

damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the subject of the Firm&#8217;s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. 

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. 

* * * 

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. 

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management&#8217;s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm&#8217;s legal expense was $ 73 million and $ 185 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 192 million and $ 213 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm&#8217;s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into 

account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s income for that period. 

Note 25 &#8211; Business segments 

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer &#38; Community Banking, Corporate &#38; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm&#8217;s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business segments. 

Segment results 

The following table provides a summary of the Firm&#8217;s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm&#8217;s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 

reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s managed basis. 

Capital allocation 

The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.: 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and changes in stockholders&#8217; equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial statements&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) Determinations Committee. 

Criticized : Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s.

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a &#8220;hybrid.&#8221; The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the &#8220;host.&#8221; For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

Current estimated LTV ratio 

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. 

Combined LTV ratio 

The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Alt-A 

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm&#8217;s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. 

Option ARMs 

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. 

Prime 

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. 

Subprime 

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower&#8217;s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in 

client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: 

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund&#8217;s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura &#8220;star rating&#8221; is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer 

categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a &#8220;primary share class&#8221; level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a &#8220;primary share class&#8221; level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

&#8220; Primary share class &#8221; means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.
