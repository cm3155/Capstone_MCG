Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $48.3 billion for 
2021, or $15.36 per share, on net revenue of $121.6 
billion. The Firm reported ROE of 19% and ROTCE of 23%. 
The Firm's results for 2021 included a reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.  
• The Firm had net income of $48.3 billion, up 66%, driven 

by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses, 
compared to an expense recorded in the prior year.

• Total net revenue was up 1%. 

– Noninterest revenue was $69.3 billion, up 6%, driven 

by higher Investment Banking fees and asset 
management fees, partially offset by lower CIB Markets 
revenue.

– Net interest income was $52.3 billion, down 4%, 
driven by the impact of lower market rates and 
changes in the balance sheet mix, partially offset by 
balance sheet growth.      

• Noninterest expense was $71.3 billion, up 7%, 

predominantly driven by higher compensation expense 
and continued investments in the business, including 
technology. 

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $9.3 

billion, driven by; 

– a $12.1 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 

losses primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, and 

– $2.9 billion of net charge-offs predominantly driven by 

The prior year provision was an expense of $17.5 billion, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
of $12.2 billion, and $5.3 billion of net charge-offs.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $18.7 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.62%, 
compared with 2.95% in the prior year; the decrease 
from the prior year was driven by reductions in the 
allowance for credit losses.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.3 billion at 
December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the 
prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting 
the impact of net portfolio activity and client-specific 
upgrades in wholesale, as well as improved credit 
performance in consumer; and lower loans at fair value in 
the CIB consumer portfolio, largely due to sales.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 3%, 

driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, partially offset by 
lower loans in CCB and CB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were up 23%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs, primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as growth 
from existing and new accounts in CCB.

Selected capital-related metrics 
• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $214 billion, and the 

Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.1% and 
13.8%, respectively.

• The Firm’s SLR was 5.4%.

• The Firm grew TBVPS, ending 2021 at $71.53, up 8% 

versus the prior year.

Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP 
financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation 
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
58-60, and Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for a

2022 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management and are subject to significant risks and 
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 
155, and the Risk Factors section on pages 9-33 of the Firm’s 
2021 Form 10-K, for a further discussion of certain of those 
risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause 
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because 
of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that 
actual results in 2022 will be in line with the outlook 
information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake 
to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2022 should be 
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets 
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive 
environment, client and customer activity levels, and 
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and 
other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these 
factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. 
The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to 
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing 
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and 
legal environments in which it operates. The outlook 
information contained in this Form 10-K supersedes all 
outlook information provided by the Firm in its periodic 
reports furnished to or filed with the SEC prior to the date 
of this Form 10-K.

Full-year 2022
• Management expects net interest income on a managed 
basis, excluding CIB Markets, to be in excess of $53 
billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be 

approximately $77 billion, which includes increased 
investments in technology, distribution and marketing, 
and higher structural expense.

Net interest income on a managed basis, excluding CIB 
Markets, and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial 
measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the 
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
58-60.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, the 
Firm has remained focused on serving its clients, customers 
and communities, as well as the well-being of its employees. 
The Firm continues to actively monitor and adapt to health 
and safety developments at local and regional levels as 
more of its global workforce returns to the office.   

For information on the impact of U.S. government actions 
and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer 
to:

• Credit Portfolio on page 109 for information on PPP,

• Consumer Credit Portfolio on page 112 and Wholesale 

Credit Portfolio on page 118 for information on retained 
loans under payment deferral, and

• Note 12 on page 231 for information on the Firm’s loan 

modification activities.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition 
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to 
make progress with respect to the transition from the use of 
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other 
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of 
Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based 
benchmark rates. As of January 1, 2022, ICE Benchmark 
Administration ceased the publication of all tenors of LIBOR 
for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR 
(collectively, “non-U.S. dollar LIBOR”) and the one-week 
and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The cessation of 
the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR 
(i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 
12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

In joint statements issued by the Federal Reserve, the OCC 
and the FDIC, the banking regulators encouraged U.S. banks 
to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar 
LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021. The Firm 
has ceased executing contracts that reference U.S. dollar 
LIBOR, with certain permissible limited exceptions, and now 
offers various floating rate products, and provides and 
arranges various types of floating rate debt financings, 
across its businesses that reference replacement rates, 
including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). 
The Firm continues to engage with clients in relation to the 
transition from the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR and 
to support clients as they move to replacement rates.

On November 16, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority 
(“FCA”) confirmed that it will allow, for a period of at least 
one year, the use of “synthetic” U.K. sterling and Japanese 
yen LIBOR rates in all legacy LIBOR contracts, other than 
cleared derivatives, that had not been transitioned to 
replacement rates by January 1, 2022. The use of these 
synthetic LIBORs, will allow market participants additional 
time to complete their transition to replacement rates or 
otherwise to reduce their exposure to contracts that do not 
have robust fallback mechanisms and that are difficult to 
amend.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the principal central 
counterparties (“CCPs”) converted cleared derivatives 
contracts linked to non-U.S. dollar LIBOR to replacement 
rates before the cessation of the publication of those 
LIBORs on December 31, 2021.

The Firm has made significant progress towards reducing its 
exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including in 
derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and 
debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet 
its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as  
the industry milestones and recommendations published by 
National Working Groups, including the Alternative 
Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. 

In connection with the transition from LIBOR, as of 
December 31, 2021 the Firm had remediated substantially 
all of the notional amount of its bilateral derivatives 
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR and non-U.S. dollar 

50

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

LIBOR, and substantially all of its non-U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked loans. The Firm continues its client outreach with 
respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans.

The Firm is also on schedule to implement further 
necessary changes to risk management systems in order to 
transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its 
operational systems and models. In 2021, the Firm changed 
the rate basis of its transfer pricing methodology for U.S. 
dollar-denominated contracts to SOFR and implemented 
internal controls to restrict the use of LIBOR in new 
transactions.

Legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of disputes 
arising from the cessation of LIBOR has been adopted or 
proposed in certain jurisdictions. The Firm continues to 
review the extent to which these legislative actions or 
proposals, if enacted, may reduce the risk of litigation and 
disputes arising from the transition from LIBOR.

The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, 
market, regulatory and legislative developments, including 
the transition relief issued by the Internal Revenue Service 
and U.S. Treasury Department in January 2022 with respect 
to the tax implications of reference rate reform.

(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current 

presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information. 

2021 compared with 2020
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and 

wallet share gains

• higher equity underwriting fees due to a strong IPO 

market and wallet share gains, and

• higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by an 

active leveraged loan market primarily related to 
acquisition financing.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:
• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily in 

Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and 
Commodities, compared to a strong prior year, and an 
increase in Securitized Products, and

• lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity 

investments in Corporate,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and 
Cash Equities

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66,  
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a 

result of higher average market levels and net inflows, 
and

• higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily 

associated with higher assets under custody.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 
63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and 
Note 6 for additional information. 

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS. Refer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for additional 
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting a net 

loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven by 
updates to model inputs related to prepayment 
expectations, and

• lower mortgage production revenue on lower production 

margins.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 
15 for further information.

Card income increased due to:

• higher net interchange income in CCB driven by an 

increase in debit and credit card sales volume above pre-
pandemic levels, partially offset by the impact of a 
renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract, as well as 
an increase to the rewards liability, and

• higher payments revenue related to commercial card and 
merchant processing in CB and CIB on higher volume,

Provision for credit losses
Year ended December 31,

partially offset by

• higher amortization related to new account origination 

costs in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, 
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for 
further information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a 

decline in volume, and

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits,

predominantly offset by

• net gains on several investments, primarily in CIB and 

AWM, and

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to 
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term 
debt in Treasury and CIO.

Net interest income decreased driven by the impact of 
lower market rates and changes in the balance sheet mix, 
partially offset by balance sheet growth. 

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $436 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.81%, down 53 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on 
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 34 
bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.91%, down 
39 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial 
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on pages 300-304 for further 
details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60 for a

Markets.

Total provision for credit losses

$  (9,256)  $  17,480  $  5,585 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting 
guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

2021 compared with 2020
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit driven by 
net reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The net benefit in consumer was driven by:

• a $9.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook, including $7.6 billion in Card, and $1.2 billion in 
Home Lending, which also reflects continued 
improvements in Home Price Index ("HPI") expectations, 
and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated;

• the prior year included a $7.4 billion net addition to the 

allowance for credit losses. 

The net benefit in wholesale was due to a net reduction of 
$2.6 billion in the allowance for credit losses across the 
LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic outlook. The prior year included a $4.7 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses. 

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66, 
CIB on pages 67-72, CB on pages 73-75, AWM on pages 
76-78, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 129-131, 
and Notes 1, 10 and 13 for further discussion of the credit 
portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

2021 compared with 2020
Compensation expense increased across the LOBs and 
Corporate, primarily from higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, as well as the impact of investments in the 
businesses.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher volume-related expense, including outside 

services, predominantly brokerage expense in CIB and 
distribution fees in AWM

• higher marketing expense predominantly driven by 

higher investments in marketing campaigns and growth 
in travel-related benefits in CCB

• higher other investments, including technology expense 

across the LOBs

• higher contribution expense, which included a $550 
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's 
Foundation in the first quarter of 2021, and

• higher other structural expense, including regulatory-

related expense,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower auto 

lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral 
values

• lower legal expense, driven by CIB and AWM, and

• the absence of an impairment recorded in the prior year 

on a legacy investment in Corporate.

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury 
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements 
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower 

client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• higher collateral requirements in CIB Markets.

Securities borrowed increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities and an increase in the demand for 
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets. 

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.

Trading assets decreased reflecting;
• a lower level of securities, primarily debt instruments 

related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB 
Fixed Income Markets

• lower derivative receivables, primarily as a result of 
market movements, as well as maturities of certain 
trades in CIB, and

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to the net impact of 
purchases and paydowns in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) 
and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolios, largely offset by 
sales in the AFS portfolio. In the second quarter of 2021, 
$104.5 billion of AFS were transferred to the HTM portfolio 
for capital management purposes. Refer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 79-80, Investment Portfolio Risk 
Management on page 132 and Notes 2 and 10 for 
additional information on investment securities.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; continued strength 

in securities-based lending, custom lending and 
mortgages in AWM; and growth in Card,

partially offset by

• a decline in CBB and CB due to the net impact of PPP loan 

forgiveness and loan originations, and

• lower retained residential real estate loans in Home 

Lending primarily due to net paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses decreased primarily as a 
result of improvements in the macroeconomic environment. 
The decline in the allowance consisted of:

• a $9.4 billion reduction in consumer, reflecting 

improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
predominantly in the credit card and residential real 
estate portfolios. The residential real estate portfolio also 
reflects continued improvements in HPI expectations, and

• a $2.5 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.

Management’s discussion and analysis

There was a $148 million net reduction in the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and 
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on 
the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction in 
the allowance for credit losses was $12.1 billion, as of 
December 31, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
106-132, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to 
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage.
Refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional information on 
Premises and equipment.

by the realization of expected cash flows; and

• an increase in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions of 

Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank, The Infatuation and Campbell 
Global. 

Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

Other assets increased due to the higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs") in CIB, and 
higher tax receivables.

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.
Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by 
growth from new and existing accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased 
driven by lower issuances of commercial paper as a result 
of lower loans in the Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduits in CIB, as well as maturities of credit card 
securitizations in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and 
Notes 2 and 17 for more information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements decreased due to lower 
secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury 
and CIO, and trading assets in CIB Markets. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 11 
for additional information. 

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher 
financing of CIB Markets activities, as well as higher 
issuances of commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for additional 
information. 
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for information on trading 
liabilities.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 19 for 
additional information.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and 
Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances, partially 
offset by fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
higher rates, and maturities of Federal Home Loan Bank 
(“FHLB”) advances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income, 
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a 
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was primarily driven by the 
impact of higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and 
cash flow hedges. Refer to page 163 for information on 
changes in stockholders’ equity, and Capital actions on page 
94, Note 24 for additional information on AOCI.

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading 

assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, 
partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower 
trading liabilities.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading 
assets, other assets, and securities borrowed, partially 
offset by higher trading liabilities and net income 
excluding noncash adjustments.

Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the 
investment securities portfolio, and other short-term 
instruments.

• In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of 
investment securities and higher net originations of 
loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under 
resale agreements.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of 
investment securities, higher net originations of loans,  
and higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements.

Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.

• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net 
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially 
offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements.

• In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an 
increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term 
borrowings. 

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

Management’s discussion and analysis

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 160-164. That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial 
statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow 

management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be 
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial 
measures used by other companies. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and 
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also 
reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown 
below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, 
are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews 
these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s 
lending, investing (including asset-liability management) 
and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility 
associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition, 
management also assesses CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur 
across revenue lines. Management believes that these 
measures provide investors and analysts with alternative 
measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures

Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as 
follows:

Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end

Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue

ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets

ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity

ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity

TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end

* Represents net income applicable to common equity

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures 
such as 
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 

excluding Firmwide legal expense, and

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less total noninterest expense.

Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s 
performance.

The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to 
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and 
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more 
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

Management’s discussion and analysis

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., 
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related 
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. 
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by 
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. 

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 

served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of 
capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. 
The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and further refinements may be 
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also 
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the 
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance.

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services 
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations not 
currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the 
business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would 
not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone 
businesses; and other items not aligned with a particular 
business segment.

Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to each 
business segment and transfers the primary interest rate 
risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO within Corporate.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities 
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the business segments.

Management’s discussion and analysis

As a result of the current interest rate environment and the 
excess liquidity stemming from government and central 
bank actions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities 
have generally declined, impacting the business segments 
net interest income. As such, during the period ended 
December 31, 2021, this has resulted in lower cost of funds 
for loans and margin compression on deposits across the 
LOBs.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital 
requirements, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced 

by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business 
segment’s net income applicable to common equity. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for 
additional information.

Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity.The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates 
Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the 
GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe 
stress environment. As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has 
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as 
a result of changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an 
increase in the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be 
effective January 1, 2023. The assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically 
reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs 
may change from time to time.  
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional 
information on capital allocation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Noninterest expense was $29.3 billion, up 5%, reflecting:

• increased compensation expense, as well as investments 
in technology and marketing campaigns, and growth in 
travel-related benefits,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense due to lower auto lease 

assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $7.0 
billion, compared with an expense of $12.3 billion in the  
prior year, driven by:

• a $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm’s macroeconomic 
outlook, consisting of $7.6 billion in Card, $675 million in 
CBB, $300 million in Auto and $1.2 billion in Home 
Lending, which also reflects continued improvements in 
HPI expectations, and 

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated.

The prior year included a $7.8 billion addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
106-132 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 
129-131 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios 
and the allowance for credit losses.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2021 compared with 2020 
Net income was $20.9 billion, up $12.7 billion, driven by a 
net benefit in the provision for credit losses, compared to 
an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $50.1 billion, a decrease of 2%.

Net interest income was $32.8 billion, down 2%, driven by:

• the net impact in Card of lower revolving loans, primarily 

due to higher payments, and lower funding costs,

largely offset by

• higher loans in Auto, and

• the accelerated recognition of deferred processing fees 
associated with PPP loan forgiveness, largely offset by 
the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits 
in CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $17.3 billion, down 3%, driven 
by:

• a decrease in mortgage fees and related income due to a 
net loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven 
by updates to model inputs related to prepayment 
expectations as well as lower production margins, 

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 

in volume, and

• lower overdraft fee revenue,

largely offset by

• higher asset management fees as a result of higher 

average market levels and net inflows, and 

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income 

driven by an increase in debit and credit card sales 
volume above pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by the 
impact of a renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract, 
an increase to the rewards liability, and higher 
amortization related to new account origination costs.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical 
Accounting Estimates on pages 150-153, and Note 6 for 
additional information on card income.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting 
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for 
purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are considered purchased 
credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 110-116 and Note 12 for further information on PCD 
loans.
(a) At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans included 
$1.6 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual 
loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on 
each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(b) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $342 million, $558 million and $963 million, 
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to 
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as 
permitted by regulatory guidance.

(c) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, generally excludes loans that were 

under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 for 
further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes 
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment 
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly 
all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(d) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $5.4 billion and $19.2 

billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The 
Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans 
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio 
on pages 108-109 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans in 
Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs 
offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1) 
$1.1 billion and $9.1 billion in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $46 
million and $264 million in Card, respectively; and (3) $115 million

and $376 million in Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing 
according to their modified terms are generally not considered 
delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 for 
further information on consumer payment assistance activity.
(f) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates 

included PCD loans. The rate at December 31, 2019 was revised to 
include the impact of PCI loans.

(g) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies of $405 million, $744 million 
and $1.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. 
These amounts have been excluded based upon the government 
guarantee.

(h) At December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $506 million of 
PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA. 

(i) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current 

presentation.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was $21.1 billion, up 24%, largely driven by a 
net benefit in the provision for credit losses, compared to 
an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $51.7 billion, up 5%.

Banking revenue was $19.8 billion, up 27%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $12.5 billion, up 41%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, reflecting 
higher fees across products. The Firm ranked #1 for 
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $4.4 billion, up 85%, driven by 

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $4.0 billion, up 43%, 
driven by a strong IPO market and wallet share gains.

– Debt underwriting fees were $5.0 billion, up 15%, 
predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan 
market primarily related to acquisition financing.

• Payments revenue was $6.3 billion, up 13%, and 

included net gains on equity investments. Excluding these 
net gains, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 5%, driven by 
higher deposit balances and fees, largely offset by 
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 13%, 

predominantly driven by lower net interest income, 
largely offset by lower fair value losses on hedges of 
accrual loans, and higher loan commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.0 billion, 
down 5%. Markets revenue was $27.4 billion, down 7%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, down 
19%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies & 
Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing, Commodities 
and Credit compared to a strong prior year, partially 
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22%, 

driven by strong performance across prime brokerage, 
derivatives and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2%, 
driven by growth in fees and deposits, predominantly 
offset by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $250 million 

predominantly driven by valuation adjustments related to 
derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $25.3 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, 
including revenue-related compensation and investments, 
as well as higher volume-related brokerage expense, 
partially offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.2 
billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $2.7 billion in the 
prior year.

difference between the price at which a market participant 
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the 
price at which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity 
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, 
which include general market conditions, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity 
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic 
conditions.  

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 
reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. 

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions 
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new 
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-
related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains 
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the 
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, 
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is affected by many factors including the level 
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the

(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net 

revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains 
and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may 
more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on 
pages 135-137.

2021 compared with 2020 
Net income was $5.2 billion, up $2.7 billion, predominantly 
driven by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses, 
compared to an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $10.0 billion, up 7%. Net interest income 
was $6.0 billion, down 3%, driven by the net impact of 
margin compression on higher deposits and a decrease in 
loans, largely offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest 
revenue was $3.9 billion, up 28%, predominantly driven by 
higher investment banking and payments revenue. 

Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, up 6%, 
predominantly driven by investments in the business, 
including higher compensation expense, and higher 
volume- and revenue-related expense.  

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $947 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $2.1 billion in the 
prior year. 

COMMERCIAL BANKING

Management’s discussion and analysis

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which 
are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral 
includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or 
other assets. Products include term loans, revolving lines of 
credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and 
standby letters of credit.

Payments includes revenue from a broad range of 
products and services that enable CB clients to manage 
payments and receipts, as well as invest and manage 
funds.

Investment banking includes revenue from a range of 
products providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-
raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet and risk 
management tools through advisory, equity 
underwriting, and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed 
Income and Equity Markets products used by CB clients is 
also included. 

Other revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent 
adjustments generated from Community Development 
Banking and activity derived from principal transactions.

2021 compared with 2020 
Net income was $4.7 billion, an increase of 58%.

Net revenue was $17.0 billion, an increase of 19%. Net 
interest income was $3.9 billion, up 14%. Noninterest 
revenue was $13.1 billion, up 21%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $9.2 billion, up 21%, 
predominantly driven by: 

• higher asset management fees, net of liquidity fee 

waivers, on higher average market levels and strong 
cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity 
products,

• higher performance fees, and

• higher net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $7.7 billion, up 
17%, predominantly driven by: 

• higher loans including the impact of lower funding costs, 

and higher asset management fees, 

partially offset by

• the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $227 
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $263 million in the 
prior year.

Noninterest expense was $10.9 billion, up 10%, driven by 
higher volume- and revenue-related compensation expense 
and distribution fees, higher structural expense, and higher 
investments in the business, partially offset by lower legal 
expense.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.

Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer 
group quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for 
U.S.-domiciled funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, 
for which the source remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. 
AWM evaluates fund performance utilizing this peer group ranking 
and believes that it provides investors with comparability across the 
industry. This change resulted in both positive and negative impacts 
on the quartile rankings for prior periods, as compared to how they 
would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, AWM has changed its 
selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table 
have been revised to conform to the current presentation.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 

rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on 
their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating 
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall 
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the 
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, 
separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-
adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of 
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to 
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star 
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other 
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the 
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All 
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values 
used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating 
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is 
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share 
class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong 
SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance 
data may have been different if all share classes had been included. 
Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and 
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share 
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary 
share class.

from municipal bonds, of $257 million, $241 million and $314 million 
for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. 

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and 

risk management employees were transferred from Corporate to CIB.

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was a loss of $3.7 billion compared with a loss 
of $1.8 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $3.5 billion, compared with a loss 
of $1.2 billion in the prior year.

Net interest income decreased primarily driven by:

• limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to 

significant deposit growth across the LOBs, and

• the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed 

securities in the first half of 2021, 

partially offset by

• higher net interest income on growth in investment 

securities.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS,

• lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity 

investments

partially offset by

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year in 

Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment 
transactions, which were more than offset by the related 
net interest income earned on these transactions, also in 
the prior year, and

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to 
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term 
debt in Treasury and CIO

Noninterest expense of $1.8 billion was up $429 million 
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm’s 
Foundation, investments related to the Firm’s international 
consumer expansion, technology initiatives, and higher 
legal expense, largely offset by the absence of an 
impairment on a legacy investment recorded in the prior 
year.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on 
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for 
credit losses.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by 
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses 
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as 
other tax adjustments, partially offset by the resolutions of 
certain tax audits.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in high-
quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manage the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits 
at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for 
further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to 
Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 for 
information on interest rate, foreign exchange and other 
risks.

The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists 
of U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency 
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government 
securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, 
other ABS and corporate debt securities. At December 31, 
2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion, and 
the average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and, where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further 
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio 
and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things:  

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;  

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; 
and  

•

Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks. 

Drivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and 
government policy, competitor and market evolution, 
business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate 
wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.

Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following 
four risk types: 

•

•

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including 

consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk. 

• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 

changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term. 

• Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. It includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model 
risk.

Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both 
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many 
consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative 
impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, 
liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative 
impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and 
customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is 
managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent 
Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the 
Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by 
the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), 
the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM 
organization and manage the risk governance structure of 
the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board 
Risk Committee in the form of the Risk Governance and 
Oversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates 
authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), 
and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each 
establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, 
set the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and 
define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that 
arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span 
across the individual LOBs, functions and regions. 

Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each area of the Firm giving rise to 
risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM 
function, and within its own management-identified risk and 
control standards. 

Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned 
Operations, Technology and Control Management, are the 
Firm’s “first line of defense” and own the identification of 
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls to 
manage those risks. The first line of defense is responsible 
for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and 
for the implementation of the risk management structure 
(which may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and 
controls) established by IRM. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

81

Management’s discussion and analysis

The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is 
the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function 
independently assesses and challenges the first line of 
defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible 
for its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and for the implementation of policies and 
standards established by IRM with respect to its own 
processes. 

Internal Audit is an independent function that provides 
objective assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk 
management as the “third line of defense.” The Internal 
Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who 
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO. 

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part 
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human 
Resources and Legal, and are responsible for adherence to 
applicable laws, rules and regulations and policies and 
standards established by IRM with respect to their own 
processes.

Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate owns the ongoing identification of 
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls, 
including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To 
support this activity, the Firm has a formal Risk 
Identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB 
and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks 
inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository 
and review the most material risks on a regular basis. The 
IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and 
Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central 
repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results 
to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk 
Committee. 

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk 
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. 
Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by 
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and 
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board 
Risk Committee.

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to 
senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the 
Firm’s risk governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the 
oversight of risk which are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs 
and other senior executives, is accountable to and may 
refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The 
Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the 
Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s 
exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business 
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s 
financial performance and condition and reviewing the 
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries 
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities 
through its independent, principal standing committees. 
The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its 
scope of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. 
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this 
function acting directly and through the principal standing 
committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and 
control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is 
primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the 

Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to 
compensation and other management-related matters, the 
Compensation & Management Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, 
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the 
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain 
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans 
and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also 
assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s independent 
registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, 
independence and performance, and of the performance of 
the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees 
oversee the operational risk and control environment of 
their respective business or function, inclusive of 
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of 
that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators 
of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may 
impact the level of operating risk in a business or function, 
addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis on 
processes with control concerns and overseeing control 
remediation. 

The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for 
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management 
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting  
the management of liquidity risk, balance sheet, interest 
rate risk, and capital risk. 

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising 
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. 

Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and 
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function may 
include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. 
For example, Country Risk Management oversees country 
risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of 
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as 
credit or market risk.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The Compensation & Management Development Committee 
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s 
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews 
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified 
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance 
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s 
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors 
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of 
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s 
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top”, the CMDC provides oversight of the Firm’s 
culture, including reviewing updates from management 
regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions 
with respect to employees, including compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight and 
review of the Firm's positions and practices on public 
responsibility matters such as community investment, fair 
lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public 
policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character 
and could impact the Firm's reputation among its 
stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on 
these matters to management and the Board, as 
appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance 
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of 
and recommends to the Board of Directors proposed 
nominees for election to the Board. The Committee 
evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate 
governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also 
appraises the framework for assessing the Board’s 
performance and self-evaluation. 

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an 
escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by 
underlying committees and/or FRC members.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide operational risk environment including 
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant 
events that have been escalated. 

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for providing oversight of the governance, 
limits, and controls that are in place within the scope of 
their respective activities. These committees review the 
ways in which the particular LOB or the business operating 
in a particular region could be exposed to adverse 
outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating 
and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these 
committees.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each 
LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s 
most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen 
by IRM through participation in relevant business reviews, 
LOB and Corporate senior management meetings, risk and 
control committees and other relevant governance forums 
and ongoing discussions. The Board of Directors oversees 
management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk 
Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management 
framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify 
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification process and their impact on risk appetite. 

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one 
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by 
the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”), 
the Operating Committee and senior management teams in 
each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic 
plan periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-
level strategic framework and performance against prior-
year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, 
refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.

These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are 
incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the 
Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm’s 
strategic plan.  

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-
adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also 
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further 
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 97-104 for further information on 
liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 
105 for further information on reputation risk.

Management’s discussion and analysis

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is 
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s 
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted 
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s 
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining 
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments. Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant 
decisions that could impact future business activities. In 
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior 
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with 
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.

Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of capital risk across the Firm.  

Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

•

Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 

capital limit breaches; 

• Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital 

management activities, including changes made to the 
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and

•

Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital 
framework intended to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulatory capital rules.

Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.  

The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management 
are to:

• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle 
and in stressed environments;

• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 

opportunities;

• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of 

strength to its subsidiaries;

•

Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” 
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution 
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable 
regulatory capital requirements;

• Meet capital distribution objectives; and

• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 

throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through: 

•

Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and 
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The 
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s 
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal 
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic 
cycles and in stress events;

• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 

potential events; and

• Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, 
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the 
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion on 
the ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding 
Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least 
annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and 
approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve 
uses CCAR and other stress testing processes to ensure that 
large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of 
economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-
looking capital assessment and planning processes in place 
that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb 
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the 
Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and 
internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), 
as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal 
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario 
from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s 
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming 
year. 

On June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had 
completed the 2021 CCAR stress test process. On August 5, 
2021, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2021 SCB 
requirement of 3.2% (down from 3.3%) and the Firm's 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement including 
regulatory buffers, of 11.2% (down from 11.3%). The 
2021 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 
2021 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2022.

86

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 
2021 CCAR results.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital stress testing control framework.

Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings 
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters 
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and 
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios 
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which 
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, 
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are 
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and 
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and 
other periodic stress testing, management also considers 
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as 
necessary. 

Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and during 
stress. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm 
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum 
capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets 
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be 
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion 
during a period of stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated 
financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The 
U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital 
Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to 
time.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the 
Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, 

weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated 
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital 
ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-
based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III 
Advanced risk-based ratios. 

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating 
credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of 
Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in 
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized 
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which 
largely rely on the use of internal credit models and 
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk 
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings 
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. 
Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent 
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. 
In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, 
the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate 
management judgment and feedback from its regulators. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding 
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to 
SLR on page 93 for additional information.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 

Key Regulatory Developments 

CECL regulatory capital transition. The Firm elected to apply 
the CECL capital transition provisions as permitted by the 
federal banking agencies which delayed the effects of CECL 
on regulatory capital for two years until January 1, 2022, 
followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital 
transition provisions”). 

As of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm 
reflected the benefit of the CECL capital transition 
provisions of $2.9 billion, which will be phased in at 25% 
per year beginning January 1, 2022.

The CECL capital transition provisions have also been 
incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
and total leverage exposure and are also subject to the 
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.

Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL 
accounting guidance.

Paycheck Protection Program. The federal banking agencies 
issued a final rule in September 2020 to neutralize the 
regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-
based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight 
to loans originated under the program. The Firm does not 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

87

Management’s discussion and analysis

expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans 
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. As of 
December 31, 2021, the Firm had $6.7 billion of loans 
remaining under the program. 

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them 
under the final rule.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expanded the scope of the prior 
capital deductions rule relating to the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based 
capital metrics.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. In 
November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a rule 
implementing “Standardized Approach for Counterparty 
Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the current 
exposure method used to measure derivatives counterparty 
exposure under Standardized approach RWA, as well as 
leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the 
regulatory capital framework. The rule applies to Basel III 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with a mandatory 
compliance date of January 1, 2022.

Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31, 
2021, the adoption of SA-CCR is estimated to increase the 
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion and 
result in a modest decrease in its total leverage 
exposure. These estimates may differ from the actual 
impact based on the composition of the Firm’s derivatives 
exposure as of March 31, 2022.

88

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 

The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a 
“capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation 
buffer incorporates a global systemically important bank 
(“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for 
Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable 
SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized 
regulatory capital requirements. 

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods based on data for the 
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the 
two. “Method 1”, reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed 
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is 
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale 
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB 
score “multiplication factor”. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

89

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced 
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage 
buffer.

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided 
by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage 
exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average 
on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be 
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance 
sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and 
derivatives potential future exposure. 

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also 
maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. 

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, 
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to 
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, 
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further 
information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 
2020. For 2022, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge under 
both Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.0% 
and 3.5%, respectively.

On November 23, 2021, the FSB released its annual GSIB 
list based upon data as of December 31, 2020, which 
announced the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% 
(up from 2.0%) effective January 1, 2023, unless the 
Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, 
is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2021.

The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2020 is 4.0%, which will be effective 
January 1, 2023. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge 
calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%. 
Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the 
Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 
4.5% on January 1, 2024 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB 
surcharge calculation based upon data as of December 31, 
2022 is lower.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment 
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of 
December 31, 2021, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer 
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to 
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be 
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine 
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 
12-month implementation period. 

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

The Firm believes that it will operate with a Basel III 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio between 12.0% and 13.0% 
in the near term, based on the Basel III capital rules 
currently in effect, and with consideration for an increase in 
the GSIB surcharge in 2023.  

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for 
additional information.

Line of business equity
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance. 

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB 
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress 
environment. As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has changed 
its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of 
changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an increase in 
the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be effective 
January 1, 2023. The assumptions and methodologies used 
to allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a 
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from 
time to time.  
The following table presents the capital allocated to each 
business segment.

The Board of Director’s authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The 
repurchase program does not include specific price targets 
or timetables; may be suspended by management at any 
time; and may be executed through open market purchases 
or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 
10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm 
may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm 
to repurchase its common shares during periods when it 
may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for 
example, during internal trading blackout periods.
Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common 
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities on page 35 of the 2021 Form 10-K for 
additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s 
equity securities.

Preferred stock 
Preferred stock dividends declared were $1.6 billion for the

and redeemed several series of non-cumulative preferred 
stock. Additionally, on December 31, 2021, the Firm 
announced the redemption of $2.0 billion of its fixed-to-
floating rate non-cumulative preferred stock, Series Z and 
subsequently redeemed those securities on February 1,

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced 
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. 
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of 
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase 
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal 
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends 
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and 
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the 
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire 
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 
2021 CCAR stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm 
became subject to the normal capital distribution 
restrictions provided under the regulatory capital 
framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to 
repurchase common shares under its existing common 
share repurchase program previously approved by the 
Board of Directors.

Refer to capital planning and stress testing on pages 86-87 
for additional information.

Other capital requirements 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt.

The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of 
eligible long-term debt requirements are shown below:

(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their 

respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result in 
limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may 
distribute, such as through dividends and common share 
repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary 
bonus payments.

The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and 
eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation of the 
amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total RWA and total

Broker-dealer regulatory capital

J.P. Morgan Securities
JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is 
J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to 
Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also 
registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject 
to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed 
by the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(“CFTC”), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) 
and the National Futures Association (“NFA”).

J.P. Morgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum 
net capital requirements in accordance with the 
“Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital 
Rule.

J.P. Morgan Securities registered with the SEC as a security-
based swap dealer effective November 1, 2021 and 
continues to be registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer.	
As a result of additional SEC and CFTC capital and financial 
reporting requirements for security-based swap dealers and 
swap dealers, J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to alternative 
minimum net capital requirements and required to hold 
“tentative net capital” in excess of $5.0 billion (up from 
$1.0 billion). J.P. Morgan Securities is also required to 
notify the SEC and CFTC in the event that its tentative net 
capital is less than $6.0 billion (up from $5.0 billion). 
Tentative net capital is net capital before deducting market 
and credit risk charges as defined by the Net Capital Rule. 
As of December 31, 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities 
maintained tentative net capital in excess of the minimum
and notification requirements. 

J.P. Morgan Securities plc
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in 
banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. 
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. 
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is

The Bank of England requires that U.K. banks, including U.K. 
regulated subsidiaries of overseas groups, maintain a 
minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities 
(“MREL”). The MREL requirements were subject to a phased 
implementation and became fully-phased in on January 1, 
2022. As of December 31, 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities plc 
was compliant with the fully-phased in requirements of the

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. 

Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Oversight function whose 
primary objective is to provide oversight of liquidity risk 
across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities 
include: 

• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; 

•

Independently establishing and monitoring limits and 
indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 

limit breaches; 

• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 

management processes;  

• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 

entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, 
as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances 
and funding activities; and 

• Approving or escalating for review new or updated 

liquidity stress assumptions.

Treasury & CIO is responsible for liquidity management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management 
are to:  

•

Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material 
legal entities are able to operate in support of client 
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well as 
during stress events, and 

• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 

liquidity sources. 

The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal 
entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and 
operational restrictions; 

• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; 

• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 

• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 

risk appetite tolerances and limits; 

• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 

related to funding and liquidity risk; and 

•

Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as 
well as certain off-balance sheet items. 

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach designed to:  

•

•

•

•

Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 

Monitor exposures; 

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 
the Firm’s legal entities; and 

Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at 
a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the 
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and 
recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, 
the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and 
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on 
pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-
related committees. 

Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm 
has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution 
and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s 
material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress 
tests are performed in response to specific market events 
or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration: 

• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 

funding markets; 

•

Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash 
outflows; and 

• Potential impediments to the availability and 

transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions. 

Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range 
of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate 
both market and idiosyncratic stresses. 

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient 
to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum 
liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of

stress when access to normal funding sources may be 
disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the 
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource 
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates 
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. 
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding 
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal 
entities in a period of stress. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over 
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress.  
Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the 
amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain 
operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA 
primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid 
securities as defined in the LCR rule. 

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. 

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020 based on the Firm’s interpretation of 
the LCR framework.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended December 31, 2021, compared with the prior year 
period primarily due to long-term debt issuances.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared 
with both the three month periods ended September 30, 
2021 and December 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in 
deposits. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under 
the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR 
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately $914 billion and $740 billion as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, 
due to an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased 
deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs 
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a 
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $308 billion and $307 billion as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Bank discount window and other central banks. Although 
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at 
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies 
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking 
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. are required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on 
an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective on 
July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly 
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,  
based on the Firm’s current understanding of the final rule.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- 
and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured 

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The 
Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from 
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by 
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid 
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk 
characteristics. 

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance 
sheet obligations.

Deposits

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 
Furthermore, certain deposits are covered by insurance 
protection that provides additional funding stability and 
results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection 
may be available to depositors in the countries in which the 
deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance 
protection for deposits placed in a U.S. Depository 
Institution. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firmwide 
estimated uninsured deposits were $1,489.6 billion and 
$1,275.9 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting 
wholesale operating deposits.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during 
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2021, reflecting significant inflows across 
the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain 
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing 
and new accounts across both consumer and small business 
customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on 
pages 61-80 and pages 55-56, respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

(f) Includes nonrecourse advances provided under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased 
at December 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 
2020, due to lower secured financing of AFS investment 
securities in Treasury and CIO, and trading assets in CIB 
Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in 
commercial paper at December 31, 2021, from 
December 31, 2020 was due to higher net issuance 
primarily for short-term liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020, and for the 
average year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the 
prior year period, was primarily due to net issuances of 
structured notes.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and 
credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional 
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on 
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and 
collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 
were as follows:

(a) On July 12, 2021, Moody’s revised the outlook of the Parent Company’s long-term issuer rating from stable to positive. The outlook for the Parent 

Company’s short-term issuer rating and the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries remained unchanged at stable.

(b) On May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor's affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and 

revised the outlook from stable to positive.

(c) On April 23, 2021, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and revised the 

outlook from negative to stable.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings 
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable 
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, 
earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a 
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and 
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management 
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies 
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, 
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk 
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as 
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the 
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate 
to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding 
whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or 
client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or consider any other activity. 
Sustainability, social responsibility and environmental 
impacts are important considerations in assessing the 
Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s 
reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues deemed material are escalated as 
appropriate. 

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and 
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various 
constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
investors, regulators, employees, communities or the 
broader public.

Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s 
LOBs and Corporate. As reputation risk is inherently 
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify, a reputation 
risk management function is particularly important.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes 
the following activities:
•

Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and standard consistent with the reputation risk 
framework 

•

Overseeing the governance execution through 
processes and infrastructure that support consistent 
identification, escalation, management and monitoring 
of reputation risk issues Firmwide

The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-
ranging and may be introduced by the Firm’s employees 
and the clients, customers and counterparties with which 
the Firm does business. These events could result in 
financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as 
other harm to the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from 
large corporate and institutional clients to individual 
consumers and small businesses. In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is 
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities 
portfolio and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages 
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk 
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management 
governance includes the following activities:

• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across 

all portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval

• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 

• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection 

with the approval of credit exposure

• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and

• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 

credit risk-based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center 
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit 
losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and 
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the 
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related 
commitments and the allowance for investment securities 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical 
Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 150-153 
for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing 
process assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses 
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying 
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. 
The stress test results may indicate credit migration, 
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the 
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and country- 
specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress 
testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a 
Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress 
on individual counterparties.

106

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for: 

• Independently validating or changing the risk grades 
assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit  
portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade 
changes initiated by responsible business units; and 

• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management 
processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the 
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given 
default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and 
management of credit exposures, and compliance with 
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. 

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-
making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit 
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, 
risk committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process for extending credit 
to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio 
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through 
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. 
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and 
other trends against business expectations, current and 
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends 
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portfolio. 

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are 
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate 
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk 
is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively 
correlated with the impact of a default by the same 
counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the 
same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its 
obligations is decreasing.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:

• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes

• Loan syndications and participations

• Loan sales and securitizations

• Credit derivatives

• Master netting agreements, and

• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

Customer and client assistance
The Firm provided various forms of assistance to customers 
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The 
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications 
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings 
(“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, 
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers 
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due 
or nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on 
pages 110-116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 
117-128 for information on loan modifications as of 
December 31, 2021. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further 
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan 
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by 
the SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to 
process and originate PPP loans. When certain criteria are 
met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will 
receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA. 
PPP loans have a contractual term of two or five years and 
provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral of 
principal and interest. The SBA will pay accrued interest 
through the payment deferral period and additional interest 
up to a maximum of 120 days past due. Based upon these 
servicing guidelines, the Firm continues to accrue interest 
for PPP loans 90 or more days past due until delinquency 
reaches 120 days past due. PPP processing fees are 
deferred and accreted into interest income over the 
contractual life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon 
forgiveness or prepayment.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had $6.7 billion 
and $27.2 billion, respectively, of PPP loans, including $5.4 
billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, in consumer, and 
$1.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, in wholesale. The 
PPP ended for new applications on May 31, 2021. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately $34 billion of 
PPP loans have been repaid through payments of 
forgiveness amounts to the Firm from the SBA. During the 
year ended December 31, 2021, this resulted in 
accelerated recognition in interest income of the associated 
deferred processing fees, primarily in CCB.

At December 31, 2021, $633 million of PPP loans 90 or 
more days past due have been excluded from the Firm’s 
nonaccrual loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66 and Note 12 
for a further discussion of the PPP.

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had 
approximately $1.3 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively, of 
retained consumer loans under payment deferral programs, 
predominantly in residential real estate, compared to 
approximately $28.3 billion at June 30, 2020. During the 
fourth quarter of 2021, there were approximately $386 
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral 
programs. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment 
deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to 
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to 
payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an 
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume 
making regularly scheduled payments, and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

Of the $1.3 billion of retained loans under payment deferral 
programs as of December 31, 2021, approximately $611 
million were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral 
and approximately $40 million were accounted for as TDRs 
because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided 
by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022. 
Borrowers that are unable to resume or continue making 
payments in accordance with the original or modified 
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from 
deferral programs will be placed on nonaccrual status in line 
with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as 
permitted by regulatory guidance, and the loans charged off 
or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. 
Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s 
nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2021, $145.5 billion, or 65% of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding 
mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were 
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and 
Illinois, compared with $146.6 billion, or 65% at 
December 31, 2020.
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios 
have declined consistent with recent improvements in home 
prices and customer pay-downs. 

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2020 driven by higher 
residential real estate loans at fair value, largely offset by 
lower auto and other loans.

The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 

Retained loans were relatively flat compared to 
December 31, 2020 as the decline in Home Lending driven 
by paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage 
loans was predominantly offset by growth in AWM. Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2020 
reflecting improved credit performance. Net recoveries for 
the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher when 
compared with the prior year as the current year benefited 
from further improvement in HPI and higher reversals of 
prior write-downs due to prepayments as a result of the low 
rate environment.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2020, 
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher 
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home 
Lending due to the continued low rate environment. 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from 
December 31, 2020 due to sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $18.7 billion at December 31, 2021. This 
amount included $6.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $6.0 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile. 
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of 
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $30.0 billion 
and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan 
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended 
December 31, 2021, in line with the performance of the 
broader prime mortgage portfolio.

and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $5 million and $9 
million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon 
the government guarantee.

(b) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that 
have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 
or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered 
collateral-dependent at time of exit.

PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to 
modified retained residential real estate loans for which 
concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified 
PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has 
elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the 
option provided by the CARES Act. Refer to Note 12 for 
further information on modifications for the years ended 
December 31, 2021 and 2020.

were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional 
information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual 
status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared 
with December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in business 
banking loans largely offset by growth in the scored auto 
portfolio. Business Banking loans declined predominantly 
due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by originations. 
The increase in the scored auto portfolio was driven by loan 
originations predominantly offset by paydowns. Net charge-
offs for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 
when compared to the prior year driven by lower scored 
auto charge-offs as the current year benefited from higher 
vehicle collateral values and elevated consumer cash 
balances, partially offset by higher overdraft charge-offs. 
The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.04% 
and 0.25% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 
2020, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2020 
reflecting strong sales volume predominantly offset by 
higher payments. The December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ 
day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, respectively, 
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%, 
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to benefit from 
the ongoing impact of government stimulus and support 
provided to borrowers who participated in payment 
assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased for the 
year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the prior 
year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2021, $70.5 billion, or 46% of the total 
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared 
with $65.0 billion, or 45%, at December 31, 2020. Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.0 billion of credit 
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, 
which does not include loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, 
compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information about loan modification 
programs to borrowers.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 119-123 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In 2021 the credit environment continued to improve 
following the broad-based deterioration during the earlier 
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of December 31, 2021, retained loans increased 
$45.4 billion driven by CIB and AWM, partially offset by 
decreases in CCB. Lending-related commitments increased 
$36.6 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity 
in CB and CIB, including an increase in held for sale 
commitments intended to be syndicated.

As of December 31, 2021, the investment-grade 
percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 71%, 
while criticized exposure decreased $3.4 billion from $41.6 
billion to $38.2 billion. The decrease in criticized exposure 
was driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific 
upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive, largely 
offset by client-specific downgrades. Nonperforming 
exposure decreased $1.2 billion driven by lower 
nonperforming loans, primarily in Oil & Gas and Individuals 
and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and client-
specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific 
downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans was 
partially offset by increases in derivatives and lending-
related commitments.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and 
covenant modifications.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had 
approximately $107 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, 
of retained loans under payment deferral programs, 
compared to $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly 
all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid 
down their loans. The Firm continues to monitor the credit 
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout 
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the 
borrowers are required to resume making regularly 
scheduled payments, and considers expected losses of 

principal and accrued interest on these loans in its 
allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of 
covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both 
payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are 
generally not reported as TDRs, either because the 
modifications were insignificant or they qualified to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option 
provided by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022. 
Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in 
accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management 
framework. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of 
these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to 
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining 
the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against 
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 

maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow 
profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $38.2 billion at 
December 31, 2021 and $41.6 billion at December 31, 
2020, representing approximately 3.5% and 4.0% of total 
wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in 
criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity and 
client-specific upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and 
Automotive, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. 
The $38.2 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 
2021 was largely undrawn and $35.0 billion was 
performing.

Real Estate
Real Estate exposure was $155.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, of which $89.2 billion was multifamily lending as shown in 
the table below. Criticized exposure increased by $455 million from $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020 to $5.3 billion at 
December 31, 2021, driven by client-specific downgrades predominantly offset by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio 
activity.

Consumer & Retail exposure was $122.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and predominantly included Retail, Business and 
Consumer Services, and Food and Beverage as shown in the table below. Criticized exposure increased by $617 million from 
$9.2 billion at December 31, 2020 to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by client-specific downgrades and net 
portfolio activity largely offset by client-specific upgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 
2020. Since December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure 
decreased $1.7 billion, largely in Oil & Gas and Individuals 
and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and client-
specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific 
downgrades.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The 
contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk 
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives 
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions 
from its market-making activities, including the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. 
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own 
credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the 
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. 
For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of 
the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded 
derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and 
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the 
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant 
CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit 
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the 
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and 
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC 
derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — 
excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not 
typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short 

maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — 
was approximately 88% at both December 31, 2021 and 
2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the 
Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 5 for a 
further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties 
and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $57.1 billion and $75.4 
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 
decrease was primarily driven by market movements and 
maturities of certain trades in CIB, partially offset by an 
increase in commodity derivatives. Derivative receivables 
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after 
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting 
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and 
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s 
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the 
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition 
of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. 

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but 
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net 
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods

management process for derivatives exposures takes into 
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which 
is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors 
may influence the nature and magnitude of these 
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations 
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with 
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages 
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit 
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three 
measures generally show that exposure will decline after 
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2021
(in billions)

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, 
the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three 
measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure 
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and 
collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a 
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly 
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the 
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm 
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a 
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of 
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.

index. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the 
current presentation.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is recognized within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 
was $18.7 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at  
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the 
macroeconomic environment, consisting of:

• a $9.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio; and 

• a $2.6 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse 
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting 
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of 
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement 
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic 
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used 
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to 
place reliance on management judgment and make 
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of 
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the 
potential impact that additional waves or variants of 
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and 
near-term supply chain disruptions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2021, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
97-104 for further information on related liquidity risk. 

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk 
Committee. 

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in 
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to 
support underserved communities and minority-owned 
businesses. The aggregate carrying values of the principal 
investment portfolios have not been significantly affected 
by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 
2021 and 2020.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk 
policy framework exists for all principal investing activities 
and includes approval by executives who are independent 
from the investing businesses, as appropriate. 

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the 
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress 
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that 
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.

132

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

 
 
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs 
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior 
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to 
determine the suitable course of action required to return 
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a 
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting 
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected 
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain 
Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as 
appropriate.

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 149.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:

• Maintaining a market risk policy framework

• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 

LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 

assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk (VaR) 
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns 
• Earnings-at-risk 
• Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management judgment. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give 
rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the 
extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the

testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its 
market risk positions. 

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different 
than the independent third-party data collected for VCG 
price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, 
in cases where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR 
model calculations require daily data and a consistent 
source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data 
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR 
model calculations. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
149 for information regarding model reviews and 
approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory 
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day 
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital 
rules, which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed 
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and 
regulators.  

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and 
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate 
daily changes in market values over the historical period; 
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each 
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to 
generate daily market values may be different across 
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly 
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or 
severe shifts in market conditions. 

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability 
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to 
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily 
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual 
price-based time series for these products, if available, 
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore 
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were primarily driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third 

quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 

benefit is not meaningful.

Generally, average VaR across risk types and LOBs was 
lower due to volatility which occurred at the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical 
look-back period, predominantly impacting exposures in 
fixed income and commodities. As a result, average Total 
VaR decreased by $40 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2021 when compared with the prior year.

In the current year, maximum VaR remained elevated 
relative to average VaR as the aforementioned volatility 
was still included in the historical look-back period in the 
first quarter of 2021.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to 
exclude certain real estate-related fair value option elected 
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based 
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these 
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total 
VaR and each of the components would have been higher 
by the amounts reported in the following table:

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. As noted previously, average Total VaR 
decreased by $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared with the prior year. Daily Risk Management 
VaR has also declined, returning to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in late March of 2020 at the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the 
daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting 
purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below 
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude 
select components of total net revenue, such as those 
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., 
intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk 
management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These 
excluded components of total net revenue may more than 
offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The 
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is 
consistent with the requirements for backtesting under 
Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting 
loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, 
assuming current changes in market values are consistent 
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on 

average five times every 100 trading days. The number of 
VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the 
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if 
the current level of market volatility is materially different 
from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of 
historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 145 of the 260 days, and 
observed 20 VaR backtesting exceptions. Twelve of the 
backtesting exceptions were in the three months ended 
December 31, 2021 as market volatility, particularly 
related to interest rates, was materially higher than the 
market volatility in the 12 months of historical data used 
for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can 
differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets 
and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB 
Markets revenue, as the population of positions which 
compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion 
of select components of total net revenue in backtesting 
gains and losses as described above. For more information 
on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended December 31, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in 
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 

The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive 
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.  

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 

Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress 
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results 
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to 
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. 
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to 
senior management, as appropriate.  

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating 
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, 
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the 
Board Risk Committee. 

Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 

Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, 
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer 
to the table on page 134 for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural 
interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject 
to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, 
working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s 
structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with 
senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the 
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing 
independent oversight and governance around assumptions 
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural 
interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate 
risk generally through its investment securities portfolio 
and interest rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of 
factors, including:

• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 

assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-

balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time

• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-
term market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)

• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of 
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-

and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
134. 

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including: 

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates. 

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but exclude 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios do 
not include assumptions to account for the reversal of 
Quantitative Easing.   

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors. 

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).

Management’s discussion and analysis

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or 
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and 
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in 
partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these 
risks using derivatives. 

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net 
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to 
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 134 for additional information on the positions 
captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as the movement in market parameters 
across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:

•

Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with 

•

•

•

central and commercial banks
Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is 
reported based on the underlying reference entity and is 
measured at the notional amount of protection 
purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized 
derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives 
protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market-
making activities is measured on a net basis, as such 
activities often result in selling and purchasing 
protection related to the same underlying reference 
entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm 
manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements. 

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:

• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 

consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework

• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 

stress across the Firm

• Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management

• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 

and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns

• Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for example, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or  
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to  
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries. 

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against 
limits.  

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021, and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows. 

The decrease in exposure to Germany and the increase in 
exposure to the United Kingdom were primarily due to 
changes in cash placements with the central banks of those 
countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity 
management activities in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased 
cash placements with the central bank of Australia, largely 
driven by client activity following monetary policy decisions 
in the country and growth in client deposits.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control) cyber 
attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. 

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable 
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control Management 
Organization, which consists of control managers within 
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day 
execution of the CCOR Framework and the evaluation of the 
effectiveness of their control environments to determine 
where targeted remediation efforts may be required. 

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is 
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework 
and establishing minimum standards for its execution. The 
LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative 
Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective 
businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR 
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance 
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the 
Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to 
assess where controls have failed, and to determine where 
remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s 
Operational Risk and Compliance organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of 
and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform 
independent assessments of significant operational risk 
events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent 
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the 
LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the 
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the 
results to senior management.

In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, including 
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational 
risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. 

The primary component of the operational risk capital 
estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the frequency and 
severity of future operational risk loss projections based on 
historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an 
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time 
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model 
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the 
quarter following the period in which those losses were 
realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect 
such losses even after the issues or business activities 
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which 
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), 
incorporates internal and external losses as well as 
management’s view of tail risk captured through 
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key 
business environment and internal control metrics. The 
Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA 
estimate of operational risk capital. 

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are leveraged as one of the key 
criteria in the independent monitoring and testing of the 
LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulation. Through monitoring and testing, Operational 
Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of 
heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of 
controls within the LOBs and Corporate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and 
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the 
development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for 
employees at the Firm. Risks identified by Operational Risk 
and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk 
and Compliance has established standards to ensure that 
consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk 
reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the 
LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of 
key risk and performance indicators against established 
thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of 
operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards 
reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to 
the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to pages 146, 147, 148 and 149, 
respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, 
Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other 
select examples of operational risks are provided below.

Cybersecurity risk 
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm 
or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by 
malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and 
continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant 
resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the 
security of computer systems, software, networks, storage 
devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security 
efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, 
cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to 
obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, 
disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other 
damage. 

Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to 
potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory 
scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity 
requirements. The Firm continues to make significant 
investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and 
to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate 
government and law enforcement agencies and other 
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of 
cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity 
threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and 
simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with 

law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry 
groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate 
employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity 
risks.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply 
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity 
risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as 
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the 
employees of such parties, or cyberattacks, including 
ransomware and supply-chain compromises could affect 
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its 
clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the 
Firm and its information assets, particularly when their 
activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security 
and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in 
regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and 
clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to 
improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents 
occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of 
their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for 
losses incurred. 

To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the 
Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to 
prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Audit 
Committee is periodically provided with updates on the 
Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended 
changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing 
efforts to improve security, as well as its efforts regarding 
significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a 
cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed to 
enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity 
incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement 
and other government agencies, and notify clients and 
customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the 
IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading 
connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various 
escalation points. 

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm 
increased the use of remote access and video conferencing 
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote 
work. As a result the Firm deployed additional 
precautionary measures and controls to mitigate 
cybersecurity risks and those measures and controls remain 
in place.

The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are 
responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s 
Information Security Program. In partnership with the 
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and 
Technology Control organization identifies information 
security risk issues and oversees programs for the 
technological protection of the Firm’s information resources 
including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential 

144

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

and personal information related to the Firm’s employees 
and customers. The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization consists of business aligned information 
security managers that are supported within the 
organization by the following products that execute the 
Information Security Program for the Firm:

Cyber Operations
Identity & Access Management

•
•
• Governance, Risk & Controls
• Global Technology Product Security 

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control 
governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and 
mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key 
governance forums to disseminate information and monitor 
technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple 
levels throughout the Firm and include representatives 
from each LOB and Corporate. The forums are used to 
escalate information security risks or other matters as 
appropriate. 

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities 
designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risk. 

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training 
that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and 
Security Management policies, standards and practices, as 
well as the expectation that employees comply with these 
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages 
personnel through training on how to identify potential 
cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and 
information. This training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for 
certain employee roles such as application developers. 
Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all 
employees to take periodic awareness training on data 
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information 
about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk 
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, 
cyberattacks and, terrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties). The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business 
interruption and public safety risks.

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
risk of payment fraud normalized in 2021 since the 
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to employ various 
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as 
providing employee and client education and awareness 
trainings.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and 
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of 
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third 
parties to a high level of operational performance and to 
mitigate key risks, including data loss and business 
disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group 
is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting 
and standards.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.

Management’s discussion and analysis

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 

Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of 
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent 
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and 
Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to 
financial products and services, relationships and 
interactions with clients and customers, and employee 
activities. For example, compliance risks include those 
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading 
activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, 
rules, and regulations related to the offering of products 
and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk 
is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including 
the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care (such 
as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of 
clients and customers or to treat clients and customers 
fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and 
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.

Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global 
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR 
Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and 
FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also 
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and 
the Audit Committee. In certain cases, Special Purpose 
Committees of the Board may be established to oversee the 
Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders. 

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity at all times and provides the 
principles that govern employee conduct with clients, 
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with 
the markets and communities in which the Firm does 
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report 
any potential or actual violation of the Code, any internal 
Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the 
Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any 
illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying 
principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, 
clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business 
partners, or agents. Code training is assigned to newly hired 
employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees 
periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to 
affirm their compliance with the Code at least annually. 

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or 
the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain 
non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous 
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services. It is administered by an outside service 
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.

146

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or inaction by an employee or employees 
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact 
the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or 
compromise the Firm’s reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles 
(the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the 
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the 
Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides 
information and resources to help employees conduct 
business ethically and in compliance with the laws 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk 
Management on page 146 for further discussion of the 
Code.

Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR 
Management policy, which establishes the framework for 
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and 
testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the 
Firm.

The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the 
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of 
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm 
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of 
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program 
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's 
employee conduct framework and reviewing the 
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and 
each designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics 
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides 
conduct education as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm. 

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services 
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing 
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:

• managing actual and potential litigation and 

enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters

•

•

advising on products and services, including contract 
negotiation and documentation

advising on offering and marketing documents and new 
business initiatives

• managing dispute resolution

•

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them

advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated 
and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and 

• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the 

Board. 

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the 
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In 
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which 
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have 
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. 

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk 
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s 
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on 
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors 
and to the Audit Committee. 
Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises 
the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk 
issues.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. 

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making 
business decisions. A dedicated independent function, 
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and 
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of 
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and 
analysis. 

The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach which is used for models, as described in detail 
below. 

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users 
and developers of models are responsible for developing, 
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring 
models to the MRGR for review and approval. Once models 
have been approved, model users and developers are 
responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model 
users and developers may seek to enhance models in 
response to changes in the portfolios and in product and 
market developments, as well as to capture improvements 
in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. 

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of the MRGR. In its review of a model, the 
MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the 
specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing 
a model, the MRGR analyzes and challenges the model 
methodology and the reasonableness of model 
assumptions, and may perform or require additional 
testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model 
reviews are approved by the appropriate level of 
management within the MRGR based on the relevant model 
tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well 
as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In 
certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm 
experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 
pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater 
degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to 
model outputs than in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 150-153 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information 
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across 
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse 
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting 
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of 
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement 
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic 
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used 
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to 
place reliance on management judgment and make 
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of 
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the 
potential impact that additional waves or variants of 
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and 
near-term supply chain disruptions.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 129 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.8% higher 
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 4.4% in the second quarter of 2022; lower 
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 

150

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

3.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a 
peak difference of approximately 6.5% in the second 
quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak 
difference of nearly 15.8% in the second quarter of 2023.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses as the impacts of 
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, 
so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated 
for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 
Additionally, expectations of future changes in portfolio 
composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect 
the allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the 
lending exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $550 million for residential 

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.6 billion for credit card 

loans

• An increase of approximately $3.0 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to  
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2021.

Fair value 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other 
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of 
the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 

within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 

reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.3 billion of 
derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting 
adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 
balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the 
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.

Management’s discussion and analysis

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The 
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, including the potential 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business 
performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well as 
actual business results and projections of business 
performance for its reporting units. The Firm has concluded 
that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not 
impaired as of December 31, 2021. For each of the 
reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at 
least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk 
of goodwill impairment based on current projections and 
valuations. 

The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent 
with management’s current business outlook assumptions 
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-
term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where 
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to 
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor 
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be 
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $9.8 billion 
and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earned on increased spend and promotional offers 
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser 
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) 
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption 
is used to estimate the number of points earned by 
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the 
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of 
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated 
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder 
redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates 
to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of 
December 31, 2021, a combined increase of 25 basis 
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the 
rewards liability by approximately $265 million.

Income taxes 
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems 

152

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for 
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is 
made.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax 
provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent 
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally 
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and 
the global tax implications are known, which could impact 
the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income 
taxes.

Litigation reserves 
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the 
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes 
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business 
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate 
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.

Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and 
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income 
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined 
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred 
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the 
provision for income taxes in the period enacted.

The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including 
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax 
planning strategies, including strategies that may be 
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In 
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a 
deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a 
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, 
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or 
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not 
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2021, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when new information becomes available, including 
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with 
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain 
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective income 
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. 
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are 
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the 
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and 
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” 
or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s 
principal executive and principal financial officers, or 
persons performing similar functions, and effected by 
JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and 
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has 
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2021. In making the assessment, management used the 
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) 
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2021, JPMorgan 
Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was 
effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. 
Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the 
Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in 
its internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2021.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report 
which appears herein.
