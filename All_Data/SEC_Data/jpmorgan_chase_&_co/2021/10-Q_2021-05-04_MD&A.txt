EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This executive overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and does not contain all of the information that is important to 
readers of this Form 10-Q. For a complete description of the trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting 
estimates affecting the Firm and its various LOBs, this Form 10-Q and the 2020 Form 10-K should be read together and in their 
entirety.

• Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 12%, 

predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense and continued investments in the 
businesses. The increase in expense also included a $550 
million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $4.2 

billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit 
losses of $5.2 billion, compared to an expense of $8.3 
billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net 
additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 
billion.  

• The total allowance for credit losses was $25.6 billion at 
March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.42%, 
compared with 2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 
2.32% in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth 
quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the 
allowance for loan losses.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.3 billion at 
March 31, 2021, an increase of $3.2 billion from the 
prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across 
multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the 
wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans 
placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, 
nonperforming assets decreased $649 million from 
December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in 
the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net 
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas 
and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value 
in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.  

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, 

driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly 
offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans 
also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck 
Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

• As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High 
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697 
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a 
fair value of approximately $841 billion, resulting in 
approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for additional 
information.

Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.3 billion for 
the first quarter of 2021, or $4.50 per share, on net 
revenue of $32.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 23% 
and ROTCE of 29%. The Firm's results for the first quarter 
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses of $5.2 billion compared to an increase in the 
allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion in the prior year, 
as well as a $550 million contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation.  

• Net income was $14.3 billion, up $11.4 billion.

• Total net revenue was up 14%. Noninterest revenue was 
$19.4 billion, up 40%, predominantly driven by higher 
CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, 
and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and 
Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in 
the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in 
the prior year. Net interest income was $12.9 billion, 
down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower 
rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.

and contribute to sustainable development beginning in 
2021 through the end of 2030. The target includes $1 
trillion for green initiatives, such as renewable energy

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and

Forward-Looking Statements on page 78 and Risk Factors on 
page 172 of this Form 10-Q and pages 8–32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of 
those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could

because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no 
assurance that actual results will be in line with the outlook 
set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update 
any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2021 should be 
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets 
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive 
environment, client and customer activity levels, and 
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and 
other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these 
factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. 
The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to 
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing 
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and 
legal environments in which it operates. The outlook 
information contained in this Form 10-Q supersedes all 
outlook information furnished by the Firm in its periodic 
reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Form 10-Q. 

Full-year 2021
• Management expects net interest income, on a managed 

basis, to be approximately $55 billion, market 
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be 
approximately $70 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card to be 

approximately 2.5%.

Net interest income, on a managed basis, and adjusted 
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17.

Post Brexit
Prior to December 31, 2020 the Firm substantially 
completed its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program 
which was intended to ensure the continuity of its business 
and operations with respect to EU clients. On March 26, 
2021, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a Memorandum of 
Understanding that sets out a framework for regulatory 
cooperation in relation to cross-border financial services. 
The Firm will monitor developments and take any necessary 
actions to ensure business continuity with respect to the 
Firm's EU clients. Refer to Business Developments on page 
50 of the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority 
confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of 
U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, 
six-month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately 
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The 
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, 
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31, 
2021, and the Firm is prioritizing those currencies and 
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation in 2021.

The Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to 
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR 
discontinuation, including contract remediation. The Firm 
also continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the 
tax implications of reference rate reform. Refer to Business 
Developments on page 51 of the 2020 Form 10-K for a 
discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected 
discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Business Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained 
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities, 
as well as the well-being of its employees. 

The Firm has raised capital and provided credit to support 
its customers and clients. The Firm continues to participate 
in the Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) PPP and since 
inception of the Program has funded approximately $40 
billion as of April 30, 2021. While the Firm’s temporary 
assistance measures for those impacted by the pandemic 
have steadily declined since early 2020, the Firm continues 
to assist those impacted, primarily in the form of payment 
deferrals.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for further information 
on PPP; Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 48-52 and 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 for further 
information on retained loans under payment deferral. 
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on PPP; Consumer 
Credit Portfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio 
on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information on retained loans under payment 
deferral.

The Firm remains focused on the well-being of its 
employees. While the vast majority of its global workforce 
continue to work from home, the Firm is actively monitoring 
the health and safety situations at local and regional levels, 
and will adapt its plans as these situations evolve.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic 
To address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the U.S. government as well as central banks and banking 
authorities around the world have taken and continue to 
take actions to help individuals, households and businesses 
that have been adversely affected by the economic 
disruption caused by the pandemic. In the U.S., several 
stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in 
March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in 
December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in 
March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan 
facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus 
payments to individuals.

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 52-53 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for further discussion on U.S. government actions 
impacting the Firm and U.S. government facilities and 
programs in which the Firm has participated.

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current 

presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting: 

The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected 
net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27  
and pages 33-34, and Note 5 for additional information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased reflecting:

• lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher 

deposits held in existing and new accounts, 

predominantly offset by

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher 
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees 
in CIB.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages 
23-27 and CB on pages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for 
additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees 
as a result of:

• higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO 

• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity 

market due to increased industry-wide fees

• higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of 

completed transactions, in part related to transactions 
announced in the second half of 2020, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds 
and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees 
and wallet share gains.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, in part due to 
the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a 
$951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other; and 
an $896 million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the 
bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.
Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue 
increased in CIB driven by strong performance in:

• Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and 

prime brokerage, and

• Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products 
and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and 
Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong 
prior year.

products and higher average market levels, net of 
liquidity fee waivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent, 

• higher levels of investment assets on higher average 

market levels and net inflows in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22 and 
pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information on 
asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue.

Investment securities gains in both periods reflected the 
impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. 
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and 
Note 9 for information on investment securities gains.

Mortgage fees and related income increased 
predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue 
reflecting higher production margins and volumes.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, Note 5 and 
14 for further information.

Card income increased driven by lower acquisition costs, 
and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and 
credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels. 
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 and Note 5 
for further information.

Other income decreased reflecting:
• Weather-related write-downs on certain renewable 

energy investments, as well as increased amortization on 
a higher level of alternative energy investments in the 
tax-oriented investment portfolio in CIB. The increased 
amortization was more than offset by lower income tax 
expense from the associated tax credits

• lower gains on certain Corporate investments, and

• lower operating lease income from a decline in auto 

operating lease volume in CCB,

partially offset by

• net valuation gains on certain investments, compared 

with losses in the prior year, in AWM, and 

• the absence of losses on certain equity investments in CIB 

in the prior year.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the 
impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet 
growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.1 
trillion, up $661 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.87%, down 127 basis points (“bps”), primarily due 
to lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE 
basis, was 1.69%, a decrease of 68 bps. The net yield 
excluding CIB Markets was 1.93%, down 108 bps.

Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB 
Markets are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the 
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates 
schedule on page 162 for further details; and the 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a further 
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net 
reductions in both the consumer and wholesale allowance 
for credit losses. 

The decrease in consumer was driven by:
• a $4.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
including $3.5 billion in Card reflecting improvements in 
the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and $625 million in 
Home Lending primarily due to the continued 
improvement in home price index ("HPI") expectations 
and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting 

lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily 
benefiting from payment assistance and government 
stimulus;

• the prior year included a $4.4 billion addition to the 

allowance for credit losses. 

The decrease in wholesale reflects a net reduction of $716 
million in the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
scenarios.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages 
23-27, CB on pages 28-29, AWM on pages 30-32, the

The effective tax rate increased driven by a higher level of 
pre-tax income that also reduced the relative impact of 
certain tax benefits, as well as the resolution of certain tax 
audits.

(a) Included Firmwide legal expense of $28 million and $197 million for 
the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(b) Included FDIC-related expense of $201 million and $99 million for the 

three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Compensation expense increased predominantly driven by 
higher revenue-related expense in CIB, as well as the impact 
of investments in the businesses.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher contribution expense, which included a $550 
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's 
Foundation

• higher investments in the businesses, including 

technology, and

• higher FDIC-related expense largely driven by balance 

sheet growth,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense, predominantly in CIB, and

• lower other structural expense, including lower travel and 
entertainment across the businesses and lower operating 
losses.

Other volume- and revenue-related expense was relatively 
flat as the increase in brokerage expense in CIB and 
distribution expense in AWM was offset by lower 
depreciation from the decline in auto lease assets in CCB.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits and lower opportunities in Treasury and CIO to 
deploy funds in securities purchased under resale 
agreements. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s 
placements of its excess cash with various central banks, 
including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased driven by the lower deployment of 
funds in Treasury and CIO; and in CIB lower client-driven 
market-making activities, partially offset by higher demand 
for securities to cover short positions. Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Note 10 for 
additional information.

Securities borrowed increased driven by client-driven 
activities in Fixed Income Financing and Equity Markets, and 
higher demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Trading assets increased due to strong client-driven 
market-making activities in equity instruments in CIB 
Markets, including prime brokerage. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 
for additional information.
Investment securities increased, reflecting net purchases 
of U.S. Treasuries in the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio 
predominantly offset by a decrease in the available-for-sale 
("AFS") portfolio. The decrease in AFS was due to paydowns 
and net valuation losses, partially offset by net purchases.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 65, and 
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information on Investment 
securities.

Loans were flat as:

• the reduction in Card due to the impact of seasonality,  
and higher payment rates; lower loans in CB; and net 
paydowns in Home Lending

were offset by

• the origination of PPP loans in CBB and CB; growth in CIB 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, and in AWM 
securities-based and custom lending, as well as 
mortgages. 

The allowance for loan losses decreased consisting of:

• a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential 
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued 
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser 
extent portfolio run-off, and 

• an $875 million net reduction in wholesale, across the 

LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic scenarios.

There was a $107 million addition to the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, which is included in other 
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The total net 
reduction to the allowance for credit losses was $5.2 
billion, as of March 31, 2021.

47-65, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased 
largely due to higher client receivables related to client-
driven activities in CIB prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased driven by 
higher MSRs as a result of lower prepayment speeds on 
higher rates, as well as net additions to the MSRs. Refer to 
Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of 
securities financing transactions in CIB prime brokerage, as 
well as higher cash collateral placed with central 
counterparties ("CCPs"). Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on securities lending transactions.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by 
lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new 
accounts across both consumer and small business 
customers. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
42-46 and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB, 
and 

• the impact of client activities in CIB.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher 
financing of prime brokerage activities, and net issuance of 
structured notes in CIB, as well as the issuance of 
commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to pages 
42-46 for information on changes in Liquidity Risk 
Management. 

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which 
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt 
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables as 
a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for 
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased largely 
due to the impact of securities financing transactions in CIB 
prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on securities lending transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased 
driven by lower issuances as a result of lower loan balances 
in the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 15 and Notes 13 and 
22 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan 
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt was relatively flat as maturities and fair 
value hedge accounting adjustments related to higher rates 
were offset by net issuances. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 42-46 for additional information. 

Stockholders’ equity was relatively flat as net income was 
offset by the impact of capital actions and a decrease in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The 
decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of higher rates 
on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow hedges. Refer 
to page 82 for information on changes in stockholders’ 
equity, Capital actions on pages 39-40, and Note 19 for 
additional information on AOCI.

• In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and 

securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, 
and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements 
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 79-83.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. 

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $916 million and 
$1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively.

(b) Included MSR risk management results of $(115) million and $(90) 
million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 6%. 

Net interest income was $7.9 billion, down 14%, driven by:

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower 

loans in Card due to the cumulative impact of lower spend 
throughout 2020 and higher payment rates, and lower 
loans in Home Lending due to net paydowns,

partially offset by

• growth in deposits in CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion, up 12%, driven by:

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

production margins and volumes, and 

• higher card income due to lower acquisition costs and 

higher net interchange income, with debit and credit card 
sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels,

partially offset by

• lower deposit-related fees given the higher deposits held 

in existing and new accounts, and

• lower auto lease volume.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, relatively flat, 
reflecting:

• higher investments in the business

offset by 

• lower structural expenses, and

• lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including 

lower depreciation on auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $3.6 
billion, compared with an expense of $5.8 billion in the prior 
year, driven by:

primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic scenarios, consisting of $3.5 billion in 
Card, $625 million in Home Lending, primarily due to the 
continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a 
lesser extent portfolio run-off, $350 million in CBB and 
$150 million in Auto, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs 
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment 
assistance and government stimulus.

The prior year included a $4.5 billion net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance 
for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 
90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$458 million and $616 million, respectively. These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(b) At March 31, 2021 and 2020, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $557 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, that 
are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based 
upon the government guarantee.

(c) Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs 

offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 48-52 for further information on consumer payment 
assistance activity. The first quarter of 2021 includes loans to customers 
that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or 
more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-
dependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of 
amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.
(d) At March 31, 2021, included $23.4 billion of loans in Business Banking 

under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm 
does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to 
Credit Portfolio on page 47 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) At March 31, 2021, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card 
and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic were $8.1 billion, $105 million and $127 million, 
respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms 
are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 48-52 for further information on consumer payment 
assistance activity.

and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, which 
are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are 
presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA 
amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. 

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.7 billion, up 189%.

Net revenue was $14.6 billion, up 46%.

Banking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 70%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up 222%, 

driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 57%, 
reflecting higher fees across products, and the absence of 
prior year markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the 
bridge financing portfolio. The Firm ranked #2 for Global 
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.1 billion, up 219%, 
largely driven by the IPO market due to increased 
industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.3 billion, up 17%, 

driven by high yield bonds and leveraged loans due to 
increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains.

– Advisory fees were $680 million, up 35%, driven by a 

higher number of completed transactions, in part 
related to transactions announced in the second half of 
2020.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion, down 2%, 
driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly 
offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.

• Lending revenue was $265 million, down 24%, 

predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of 
accrual loans in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $10.1 billion, up 
37%. Markets revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.8 billion, up 15%, 

predominantly driven by strong performance in 
Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower

revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets 
compared to a strong prior year.

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.3 billion, up 47%, driven 
by strong performance across derivatives, Cash Equities, 
and prime brokerage.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 2%, 

with deposit margin compression largely offset by deposit 
balance growth.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $3 million, 

compared with a loss of $951 million in the prior year 
which was predominantly driven by funding spread 
widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $7.1 billion, up 19%, 
predominantly driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation expense, partially offset by lower legal 
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $331 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $1.4 billion in the 
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 
and 6 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 74 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further 
information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 18 for discussion of 

revenue sharing.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up $1.0 billion, predominantly 
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11%. Net interest income 
was $1.5 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit margin 
compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit 
balances and lending revenue due to increased portfolio 
spreads. Noninterest revenue was $917 million, up 51%, 
predominantly driven by higher investment banking 
revenue, the absence of prior year markdowns in the bridge 
financing portfolio, and higher deposit-related fees, 
particularly cash management fees.    

Noninterest expense was $969 million, down 2%, driven by 
lower structural expense.    

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $118 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $1.0 billion in the 
prior year.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 86%.

Net revenue was $4.1 billion, up 20%. Net interest income 
was $931 million, up 8%. Noninterest revenue was $3.1 
billion, up 24%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, up 26%, 
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net 
inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher 
average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, and

• net investment valuation gains, compared with losses in 

the prior year.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $1.9 billion, up 
15%, largely driven by: 

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 

management fees, loan margin expansion and an 
investment valuation gain, 

largely offset by 

• deposit margin compression. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 6% 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, partially offset by lower structural 
expense. 

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $121 
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses.

47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $580 million compared with a net loss of $125 
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639 million. 
The decrease was driven by:

• lower net interest income on lower rates, as well as 
limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to 
continued deposit growth,

partially offset by 

• higher noninterest revenue reflecting net gains on certain 

legacy private equity investments compared with net 
losses in the prior year, offset by lower investment 
securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio, as well as lower gains on 
certain Corporate investments.

Noninterest expense of $876 million was up $730 million 
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation and higher structural expense. 

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes as well as the 
impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year expected tax rate 
relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially 
offset by the resolution of certain tax audits.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

• Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.

35

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 

The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies 
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approaches compared to their respective 
minimum capital ratios. 

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional 
information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their 
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided 
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of 
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a 
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 
(“CECL capital transition provisions”). 

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 
2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion, 
which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings 
and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for 
credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances 
on PCD loans).  

36

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk 
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL 
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting 
guidance.  

SLR temporary revision. The Federal Reserve issued an 
interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the 
calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of 
calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude 
the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities 
and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions 
became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect 
through March 31, 2021.  

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and FDIC issued an 
interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and 
remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides 
IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary 
exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 
2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this 
exclusion.

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued 
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of 
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by 
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated 
under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by 
the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit 
losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had 
approximately $32 billion of loans under the program. 

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
(“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude 
them under the final rule. 

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing 
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s 
risk-based capital metrics.

The following table presents the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized 
and Advanced approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a

Common stock dividends 
The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend is currently

approval by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Common stock
On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic 
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm 
temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. 
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, 
including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases 
through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the 
Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including 
the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in 
the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm 
announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new 
common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As 
directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and 
common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were 
restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s 
net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. On 
March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these 
restrictions through at least the second quarter of 2021.

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On April 5, 2021, the Firm submitted its 2021 Capital Plan 
to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2021 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") 
process. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will 
disclose the Firm’s indicative Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") 
requirement which will become effective October 1, 2021 
and summary information regarding the Firm’s stress test 
results by July 1, 2021. The Firm's SCB is currently 3.3%. 

Based on the Federal Reserve's March 25, 2021 
announcement, if the Firm remains above all of its 
minimum risk-based capital requirements based on the 
2021 CCAR stress test results, the temporary restrictions on 
capital distributions currently in effect will expire as 
planned on June 30, 2021. However, if the Firm falls below 
any of its minimum risk-based requirements in the 2021 
CCAR stress test it will remain subject to the temporary 
restrictions through at least September 30, 2021.

Refer to Capital planning and stress testing on pages 91-92 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on CCAR.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its 
assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is 
not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports 
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

The Firm’s average LCR was 110% for the three months 
ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended March 31, 2021, compared with the prior year period 
primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from 
a significant increase in deposits.

42

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with both 
the three month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 
March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits 
continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by 
the effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s 
reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due 
to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash 
outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA 
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, 
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes 
would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities 
included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately 
$841 billion and $740 billion as of March 31, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of 
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on 
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased 
compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an 
increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess 
eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was 
primarily a result of increased deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount window at the 
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the 
Firm to such banks of approximately $301 billion and $307 
billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of 
cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or 
other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at 
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central 
banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and the other central banks as a primary source of 
liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is intended 
to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” 
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On 
October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final 
NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as 
the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 
100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become 
effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to 
publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 

The Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100% 
minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based 
on its current understanding of the final rule.

Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of 

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.  

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March 31, 2021, and December 31,

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of 
total liabilities, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during 
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended 
March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended 
March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the 
LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government 
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the 
increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as 
growth from existing and new accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on 
pages 18-34 and pages 12-13, respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

(f) Includes nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF. Refer to page 106 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the 

MMLF.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at 
March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, 
reflecting higher secured financing of AFS investment 
securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading 
assets in CIB, and the impact of client activities in CIB.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist 
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale 
commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper at 
March 31, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to 
higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity 
management.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured 
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary 
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC 
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The 
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance 
and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended 
March 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 15, and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021, 
except as noted below, were as follows:

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or 
customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 

CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in 
credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.
In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained 
(i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain 
loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not 
include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and 
classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further 
information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 11, 22, and 
4 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-
related commitments and derivative receivables, including 
the Firm’s accounting policies.

credit derivatives used to manage both performing and nonperforming 
wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not qualify for hedge 
accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit derivatives on page 62 and Note 4 
for additional information.

(c) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government 
agencies of $798 million and $874 million, respectively, and real estate 
owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of $8 million and $9 
million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt 
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by 
regulatory guidance.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The 
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications 
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings 
(“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, 
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers 
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or 
nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on 
pages 48-52 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 
for information on loan modifications as of March 31, 2021. 
Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 
10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies 
for loan modifications and the allowance for credit losses.
Paycheck Protection Program
The Firm continues to participate in the PPP, for which the 
application deadline was extended to May 31, 2021. At 
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had 
approximately $32 billion and $27 billion of loans under the 
PPP, respectively, including $23 billion and $19 billion in the 
consumer portfolio, and $9 billion and $8 billion in the 
wholesale portfolio. The impact on interest income related to 
PPP loans was not material for the three months ended 
March 31, 2021.
When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to 
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the 
forgiveness amount from the SBA. The Firm continues to 
process forgiveness applications and through March 31, 
2021, approximately $7 billion of loans were forgiven.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion on the PPP.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of 
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto 
and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-
related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving 
primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. 
In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic 
environment continued to improve. The credit performance 
of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, 
benefited from government stimulus programs, payment 
deferrals and increasing home prices. The Firm may obtain 

credit protection against certain pools of loans in the 
retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit 
linked notes. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-120 and Note 12 of 
JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information 
on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and 
charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 
10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information on lending-related commitments.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate.
(b) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, excluded operating lease assets of $20.0 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets 

are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $23.4 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that 
PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for a 
further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm 
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain 
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies 

of $798 million and $874 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In 
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited 

COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged down 
to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(k) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $21.3 billion and $22.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 

respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.
As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had $9.3 billion of retained 
loans under payment deferral programs, which represented 
a decrease of approximately $1.5 billion from December 31, 
2020, $3.0 billion from September 30, 2020 and $19.0 
billion from June 30, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, 
there were approximately $886 million of new enrollments 

in payment deferral programs predominantly in residential 
real estate and credit card. Predominantly all borrowers that 
exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm 
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans 
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period 
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to 
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

(f)

Of the $9.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral 
programs as of March 31, 2021, approximately $3.9 billion 
were accounted for as TDRs, either because they were 
accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because 
they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance provided by the CARES Act 
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Predominantly all borrowers, including those with loans 
accounted for as TDRs, were current upon enrollment in 
payment deferral programs and are expected to exit 
payment deferral programs in a current status, either 
because no payments are contractually due during the 
deferral period or because payments originally contractually 
due during the deferral period will be due at maturity upon 
exit. For those borrowers that are unable to resume making 
payments in accordance with the original or modified 
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from 
deferral programs, they will be placed on nonaccrual status 
in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit 
cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven 
by higher loans in auto and other reflecting PPP loan 
originations, partially offset by lower residential real estate 
loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 

The retained loan portfolio declined from December 31, 
2020 due to paydowns predominantly in Home Lending 
which were largely offset by originations of prime mortgage 
loans in Home Lending and AWM. Retained nonaccrual 
loans were relatively flat from December 31, 2020. Net 
recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2021 
were lower when compared with the same period in the 
prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a 
loan sale in Home Lending.

The loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio 
increased from December 31, 2020 largely driven by 
warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at fair 
value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to 
sales in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $22.2 billion at March 31, 2021. This 
amount included $8.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $7.3 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were 
$25.9 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans 
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by 
an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 
2021 were consistent with the broader residential 
mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is 
generally in line with the performance of the broader 
residential mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale 
and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to 
certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to 
government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has 
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of 
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act 
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer

government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table 
above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in 
accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back 
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform 
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional 
information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with 
Ginnie Mae.

(b) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans

loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared 
with December 31, 2020 due to PPP loan originations net 
of forgiveness in Business Banking as well as from growth in 
the auto portfolio from loan originations, largely offset by 
paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent 
loans. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 
0.13% and 0.41% for the three months ended March 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively. Auto charge-offs for the 
three months ended March 31, 2021 benefited from 
government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and 
high vehicle collateral values.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2020 
reflecting the impact of seasonality as well as higher 
payment rates. The March 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.40% and 0.80%, respectively, 
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%, 
respectively. The delinquency rates were positively 
impacted by borrowers who received payment assistance 
and government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for the 
three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with the 
same period in the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs 
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment 
assistance and government stimulus.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At March 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.3 billion of credit card 
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to 
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 11 for 
additional information about loan modification programs to 
borrowers.

sheets.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold 
through credit derivatives used to manage both performing and 
nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not 
qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit 
derivatives on page 62 and Note 4 for additional information.
(c) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all 
of these loans were considered performing.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 55-59 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB including business banking and auto 
dealer for which the wholesale methodology is applied 
when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic 
environment continued to improve following the broad-
based credit deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of March 31, 2021, retained loans remained relatively 
flat while lending related commitments increased $31.4 
billion from December 31, 2020 to $481.2 billion, driven 
by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase 
in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the 
investment- grade percentage of the credit portfolio 
decreased from 71% to 69% driven by net portfolio 
activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure 
increased $5.3 billion from $41.6 billion at December 31, 
2020 to $46.9 billion at March 31, 2021, driven by select 
downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades. 
Nonperforming exposure was relatively flat at $4.9 billion 
and net charge off activity was $53 million.

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and 
covenant modifications.

As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $1.3 
billion of retained loans still under payment deferral, 
representing 0.25% of the loan portfolio which has 
decreased approximately $0.3 billion from December 31, 
2020, $5.0 billion from September 30, 2020, and $15.5 
billion from June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that 

exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans, 
and the Firm has not experienced significant new payment 
deferral requests. The Firm continues to monitor the credit 
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout 
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the 
borrowers are required to resume making regularly 
scheduled payments and considers expected losses of 
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its 
allowance for credit losses.

(a) As of March 31, 2021, predominantly SPEs.
(b) Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment deferral, divided by the respective industry total retained loans balance.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment 
deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant 
or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the 
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered 
performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to 
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the 
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on 
internal risk ratings.

(a) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio, and loans at fair value.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. 
Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or 
changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.9 billion at 
March 31, 2021, compared with $41.6 billion at 
December 31, 2020, representing approximately 4.4% and 
4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The 
increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select 
downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades . The total 
criticized exposure was largely undrawn and $42.8 billion 
was performing.

Oil & Gas exposure was $41.5 billion as of March 31, 2021, including $20.4 billion of Exploration & Production and Oil field 
Services as shown in the table below. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the investment-grade percentage 
decreased from 47% to 42%, as a result of new non-investment grade commitments. However, criticized exposure decreased 
by $472 million from $5.7 billion to $5.3 billion, driven by select upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by select 
downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2021 
and 2020. Since March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure 
increased $1.5 billion, driven by downgrades across 
multiple industries on client credit deterioration, with the 
largest concentration in Real Estate, predominantly within 
Retail and Lodging. In the three months ended March 31, 
2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $390 million, 
when compared to December 31, 2020 driven by net 
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas and 
Individuals.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88% at both March 31, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of 
derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $73.1 billion and $79.6 
billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market 
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value 
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and the related 
cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held 
liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm 
believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security 
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s 
favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets 
as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the 
appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take 
into consideration other collateral, which generally 
represents securities that do not qualify as high quality 
liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes 
is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each 
counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables 
for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the 
net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile 
for the periods presented.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily 
marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this 
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally 
held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the 
Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the 
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires 
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to 
reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are 
reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on 
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the table above, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
recognized within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance 
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 
decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, 
consisting of:

• a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential 
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued 
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser 
extent portfolio run-off, and

• a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the 

LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic scenarios 

While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the 
Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not 
experienced in recent history, which has created additional 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and 
increased the reliance on management judgment. These 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates 
remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 
2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range 
of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have 
been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately 
address these economic circumstances.

Further, despite the improvement in the economy, 
uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying 
labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, 
and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that 
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a 
result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place 
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in 
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above 
eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six 
percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross

placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably expected 
to be modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.
(c) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million and $19 million  as of

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial 
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. 
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended 
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for 
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $595.4 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70 for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
42-46 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership or 
other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset 
classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In 
general, principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments and investments made to enhance or 
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies. The Firm’s 
investments will continue to evolve in line with its 
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support 
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the 
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly 
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 
uncertainties remain that could result in future negative 
impacts.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur, such as those observed at the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 73.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. 

Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.  

(b) Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third quarter 

of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer holds this position.

(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 

benefit is not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR increased by $10 million for the three 
months ended March 31, 2021 when compared with the 
prior quarter driven by increases in exposure in fixed 
income, partially offset by volatility which occurred in late 
March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period.

Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $47 million for the three 
months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same 
period in the prior year. This increase was driven by 
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic and predominantly impacted exposure in fixed 
income, as well as increases from Corporate VaR due to the 
inclusion of a private equity position that became publicly 
traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. These 
increases were partially offset by risk reductions in equities.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to 
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected 
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based 
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these 
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total 
VaR and each of the components would have been higher 
by the amounts reported in the following table:

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. As noted previously, average total VaR 
increased by $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year. 
However, as of March 31, 2021 daily Risk Management VaR has declined from March 31, 2020 as the volatility which occurred 
in late March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to roll out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset 
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 165 of the 259 days, and observed two VaR 
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 47 of the 63 days, 
and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended March 31, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily 
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A 
backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. 
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart 
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and 
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities 
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any 
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these 
scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due 
to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table 
below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected 
updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as 
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of 
March 31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could 
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never 
experienced an interest rate environment where the 
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While 
the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings-
at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of 
up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income. 
In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling 
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require 
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual 
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the 
table below.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Given the remaining uncertainty around the COVID-19 
pandemic, Country Risk Management continues to monitor 
the impact to individual countries.

Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2021 and their 
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.

The increase in exposure to Australia was predominantly 
due to increased cash placements with the central bank of 
Australia, driven by client activity following recent policy 
decisions in the country and growth in client deposits.

Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the on-going impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues 
to leverage use of remote access and also video 
conferencing solutions provided by third parties to facilitate 
remote work. As a result, the Firm deployed additional 
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level 
across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19 
pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment 
authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams 
involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of 
fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of 
these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators 
continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for 
managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee 
and client education and awareness trainings. 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk 
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected 
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, 
health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and 
customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency 
program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its 
critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, 
technology and facilities) in the event of a business 
interruption. The program includes governance, awareness 
training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as 
strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and 
manage business interruption and public safety risks. The 
strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program 
has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s 
business operations during and after various events.

72

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 74-76 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64 and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest 

effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market 
and weak overall economic conditions that  affected 
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of 
improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of 
underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus 
strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior 
that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. 
Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate 
the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 2.4% higher 
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021; lower 
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 2.6% lower 
at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak 
difference of nearly 6.6% in the third quarter of 2021; and 
lower national HPI with a peak difference of 17.4% and a 
trough in the second quarter of 2022.

74

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:

• the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse 

scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as 
of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing 
allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those 
estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in 
the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees 
not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher 
degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss 
estimations 

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration 

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, effects of government support and customer 
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2021, the Firm 
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse 
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the 
additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse 
scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison 
between these two scenarios reflects the following 
differences:

estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2021.

Fair value   
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.9 billion 
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the 
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation 
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $3.6 billion for credit card 

loans

• An increase of approximately $2.1 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill 
impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
March 31, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $8.0 billion and $7.7 
billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 
154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description 
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated 
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 154-155 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Effects on financial statements

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and 
updated January 
2021

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current 
accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge 
accounting relationships, and other transactions are 
amended due to reference rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain contract 
amendments related to reference rate reform as 
modifications rather than extinguishments without the 
requirement to assess the significance of the 
amendments.  

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge 

accounting relationship without automatic termination 
of that relationship. Provides various practical 
expedients and elections designed to allow hedge 
accounting to continue uninterrupted during the 
transition period.  

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out 
of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria 
are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to 

account for derivatives modified to change the rate 
used for discounting, margining, or contract price 
alignment (collectively “discounting transition”) as 
modifications. 

•

Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 
2021 update was effective when issued. 

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical 

expedients related to contract modifications and hedge 
accounting relationships, and discounting transition 
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting 
transition election was applied retrospectively. The main 
purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the 
administrative burden of accounting for contracts 
impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did 
not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
