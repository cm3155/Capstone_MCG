(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
(b) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition

JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third 
quarter of 2021 versus the third quarter of 2020, unless 
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $11.7 billion for 
the third quarter of 2021, or $3.74 per share, on net 
revenue of $29.6 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 18% 
and ROTCE of 22%. The Firm's results for the third quarter 
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses of $2.1 billion and an income tax benefit of $566 
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax 
return. The tax benefit included state and local impacts of 
federal tax method changes and a reduction in the valuation 
allowance for U.S. foreign tax credits.

• Net income was $11.7 billion, up $2.2 billion.

• Total net revenue was up 1%.

– Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 2%, driven 
by higher Investment Banking fees in CIB and asset 
management fees in AWM, predominantly offset by net 
investment securities losses in Corporate compared to 
net gains in the prior year, and lower revenue in Home 
Lending.

– Net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 1%, driven 
by balance sheet growth and higher market rates, 
predominantly offset by change in balance sheet mix 
and lower net interest income in CIB Markets.

• Noninterest expense was $17.1 billion, up 1%, driven by 

continued investments in the business, including 
marketing and technology, and higher volume- and 
revenue-related expense, predominantly offset by lower 
legal expense and structural expense. Noninterest 
expense for the prior year included an impairment on a 
legacy investment.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.5 
billion, reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for 
credit losses of $2.1 billion, driven by improvements in 
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and $524 million of 
net charge-offs. 

– The net reserve release in the current period consisted 

of $1.2 billion in Wholesale and $874 million in 
Consumer, driven by $850 million in Card.

– Net charge-offs of $524 million declined $656 million, 

predominantly driven by Card.

The prior year provision was an expense of $611 million, 
reflecting $1.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net 
reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $569 
million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $20.5 billion at 
September 30, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.86%, 
compared with 2.02% in the second quarter of 2021, 
and 3.26% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.9 billion at 

September 30, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the 
prior year, driven by: 

– paydowns and upgrades in the wholesale portfolio, 

across CB, CIB and AWM, and

– lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the consumer 

portfolio due to sales in CIB. 

Nonperforming assets were down $920 million from June 
30, 2021, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the 
wholesale and consumer portfolios, reflecting improved 
credit performance and paydowns.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 5% 

driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM, partially offset by  
lower loans in CB and CCB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 19%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and 
are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 90 and Risk Factors on 
page 194 of this Form 10-Q and pages 8–32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of 
those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could 
cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially 
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance 
that actual results will be in line with the outlook information 
set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any 
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2021 should be viewed 
against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the 
COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets activity, the 
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client 
and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative 
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm 
does business. Each of these factors will affect the 
performance of the Firm and its LOBs. The Firm will continue 
to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and 
operations in response to ongoing developments in the 
business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in 
which it operates. 

Full-year 2021
• Management expects net interest income, on a managed 

basis, to be approximately $52.5 billion, market 
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be 
approximately $71 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card to be 

approximately 2.0%.

Net interest income, on a managed basis, and adjusted 
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures on pages 20-21.

Business Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained 
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities, 
as well as the well-being of its employees.

The Firm continues to actively monitor the health and 
safety situations at local and regional levels as more of the 
Firm's global workforce returns to the office, and will adapt 
its plans as these situations evolve.

Form 10-K for a discussion of U.S. government actions

programs in which the Firm has participated. 

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority 
("FCA") confirmed that the publication of the principal 
tenors of the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate 
("LIBOR") (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately 
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The 
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, 
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31, 
2021. The Firm continues to prioritize those currencies and 
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation and is finalizing its 
operational readiness to support rate fallback mechanisms 
across all products that reference IBORs for which 
publication will cease on December 31, 2021.

The Firm continues to engage with clients to arrange for the 
remediation of in-scope IBOR-linked contracts, and to 
amend contracts with clients that are prepared to do so. For 
example, substantially all of the notional amounts of the 
Firm’s derivatives exposures that are documented under 
bilateral agreements now contain IBOR fallback provisions 
by virtue of counterparty adherence to the 2020 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.’s 
("ISDA") IBOR Fallbacks Protocol. The Firm is also prepared 
for the conversion to alternative reference rates at various 
central counterparties ("CCPs") scheduled for the fourth 
quarter of 2021.

The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have 
encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that 
use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 
2021, and in connection with this, the Firm now offers 
various floating rate products, and provides and arranges 
various types of floating rate debt financings, that reference 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) across its 
businesses. 

The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the 
tax implications of reference rate reform and the legislative 
progress associated with contracts or instruments that do 
not have satisfactory rate fallback mechanisms and that 
cannot easily be amended (e.g., certain floating rate debt 
securities, securitizations and adjustable rate mortgages). 
Refer to Business Developments on page 51 of JPMorgan 
Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
primarily reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and  

wallet share gains, and

• higher equity underwriting fees due to wallet share gains 

and increased activity in the IPO market.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and Note 5 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:

• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets across 

products, particularly in Commodities, Rates and Credit 
compared to a strong prior year, including an adjustment 
to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio; and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across prime brokerage, derivatives and 
Cash equities.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34  and Note 5 
for additional information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased largely as a 
result of higher cash management fees in CIB and CB.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and CB on 
pages 35-38, and Note 5 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees 
in AWM as a result of cumulative net inflows into long-term 
products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity 
fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher level of client 
investment assets on higher average market levels and net 
inflows.

Refer to AWM and CCB segment results on pages 39-43, 
and pages 24-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional 
information on asset management, administration and 
commissions revenue.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year from the sales of 
U.S. GSE and government agency mortgage-backed 
securities ("MBS"). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 44-46 and Note 9 for additional information on 
investment securities gains/(losses).

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior 
period, and

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting lower 

partially offset by

production margins, partially offset by higher volumes.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, Note 5 and 
14 for additional information.

Card income decreased reflecting the amortization of 
higher account origination costs, including promotional 
offers. Net interchange was relatively flat as the increase in 
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an increase 
to the rewards liability. Refer to CCB segment results on 
pages 24-28, Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88, 
and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income increased reflecting: 

• higher gains on several investments, predominantly in 

CIB, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to 

derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination 
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and 
CIO, 

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of 

the decline in volume.

Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet 
growth and higher market rates, primarily offset by change 
in balance sheet mix and lower net interest income in CIB 
Markets.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $345 billion, primarily driven by higher deposits 
with banks, and the yield was 1.80%, down 25 basis points 
(“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 
1.62%, a decrease of 20 bps. The net yield excluding CIB 
Markets was 1.91%, down 14 bps.

Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB 
Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the 
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates 
schedule on page 183 for further details; and the 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a further 
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and 

wallet share gains

• higher equity underwriting fees due to increased activity 

and wallet share gains in the IPO market, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by an active 

leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition 
financing.

Principal transactions revenue decreased driven by CIB, 
reflecting:

• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in 

Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Commodities 
compared to a strong prior year, and an increase in 
Securitized Products,

• higher revenue in Equity Markets driven by strong 

performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and 
Cash Equities,

• favorable results in Credit Adjustments & Other, with a 
net gain of $338 million largely driven by valuation 
adjustments related to derivatives, compared with a 
$272 million net loss, in the prior year, predominantly 
driven by losses on certain components of fair-value 
option elected liabilities, as well as the impact of funding 
spread widening on derivatives; and

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash 
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were 
more than offset by the related net interest income earned 
on these transactions.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of:

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher 
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees 
in CIB, 

predominantly offset by

• lower overdraft fees in CCB.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of 

strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity 
products and higher average market levels, net of 
liquidity fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher 
level of client investment assets on higher average 
market levels and net inflows, and

• higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily 
associated with the higher level of assets under custody.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year from the sales of 
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:
• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

production volumes.

Card income increased due to higher net interchange 
income and merchant processing fees reflecting the 
acceleration of debit and credit card sales volume above 
pre-pandemic levels, and lower amortization costs related 
to new account originations.
Other income increased reflecting:
• gains on several investments compared with losses in the 
prior year, primarily in CIB, and higher gains in AWM, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early 
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in 
Treasury and CIO, and derivatives in Other Corporate,

11

predominantly offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of 

the decline in volume, and

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits. Additionally, the first quarter of 
2021 included weather-related write-downs on certain 
renewable energy investments.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the 
impact of lower market rates and change in balance sheet 
mix, partially offset by balance sheet growth. 

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $454 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.82%, down 65 bps. The net yield on these assets, on 
an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 40 bps. The net 
yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.92%, down 49 bps.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net

Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net 
reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflected a net reduction of $1.2 
billion in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly in 
CIB and CB. The prior year included a $270 million net 
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $874 million reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, in particular $850 million in Card reflecting 
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card as consumer 
cash balances remained elevated benefiting from the 
residual impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs;

• the prior year included a $396 million reduction in the 

allowance for credit losses. 

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, CIB on pages 
29-34, CB on pages 35-38, AWM on pages 39-43, the 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76, and Notes 9 
and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio 
and the allowance for credit losses. 

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 

losses, including $6.2 billion in Card reflecting 
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and 
$1.2 billion in Home Lending primarily due to continued 
improvements in Home Price Index ("HPI") expectations, 
and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting 
from the impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs;

• the prior year included an $8.3 billion addition to the 

allowance for credit losses. 

The decrease in wholesale reflects a net reduction of $2.3 
billion in the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook. The prior year included a $6.7 billion net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses.

to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return. The tax 
benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury 
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements 
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower 

client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in 

CIB Markets.

Securities borrowed increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities, and an increase in the demand for 
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets.

Refer Note 10 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.

Trading assets increased reflecting;

• client-driven market-making activities in equity 

instruments, predominantly in CIB prime brokerage,

partially offset by
• lower derivative receivables, primarily driven by 

maturities of certain trades in CIB, and

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO. 

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to purchases and 
paydowns in held-to-maturity ("HTM") securities, partially 
offset by paydowns and net purchases in available-for-sale 
("AFS") securities. In the second quarter of 2021, AFS 
securities of $104.5 billion were transferred to the HTM 
portfolio for capital management purposes. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 44-46, Investment 
Portfolio Risk Management on page 77, and Notes 2 and 9 
for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; and higher 

securities-based lending, mortgages, as well as custom 
lending in AWM,

partially offset by

• lower loans in CBB and CB primarily driven by the impact 
of PPP forgiveness; and lower retained residential real 
estate loans in Home Lending primarily due to net 
paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses decreased, consisting of:

• a $7.9 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and in the residential real 
estate portfolio, primarily due to continued 
improvements in HPI expectations, and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.

There was a $104 million net reduction in the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and 
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on 
the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction in 

16

September 30, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to 
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially offset 

by the realization of expected cash flows; and

• an increase in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions of 

Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank and Campbell Global. 

Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased due to the higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs") in CIB, and 
higher tax receivables. Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on securities financing transactions.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by 
growth from existing and new accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers. Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 54-58 and Notes 2 and 15 for 
additional information. 

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• the impact of client activities and secured financing of 

trading assets in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 

Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased predominantly as a result 
of higher financing of prime brokerage activities in CIB. 
Refer to pages 54-58 for information on changes in 
Liquidity Risk Management. 

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which 
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt 
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables 
largely as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 
and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for 
additional information on securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased 
driven by maturities of credit card securitizations in 
Treasury and CIO, as well as lower issuances of commercial 
paper as a result of lower loan balances in the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits in CIB. Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 19 and Notes 13 and 
22 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and 
loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances, partially 
offset by fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
higher rates. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
54-58 for additional information. 

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income, 
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a  
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of 
higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow 
hedges. Refer to page 94 for information on changes in 
stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on pages 51-52, and 
Note 19 for additional information on AOCI.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements 
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 91-95.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 

excluding Firmwide legal expense

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. 

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm 
allocates interest income and expense to each business 
segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate. 
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate 
risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements on a product-
by-product basis within each business segment.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and 
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on page 51, and page 98 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $769 million and $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, 

and $2.5 billion and $3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Included MSR risk management results of $(145) million and $145 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 

$(363) million and $134 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Quarterly results 
Net income was $4.3 billion, up 12%, driven by a decrease 
in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 3%. 

Net interest income was $8.4 billion, up 4%, driven by:

• growth in deposits net of margin compression as well as 

the impacts from PPP including the accelerated 
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan 
forgiveness in CBB, lower prepayments in Home Lending, 
higher auto loans, and lower funding costs in Card, 

partially offset by

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of higher 
payments and lower cumulative sales volume throughout 
2020.

Noninterest revenue was $4.1 billion, down 15%, driven 
by:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior 
period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the 

decline in volume,

• lower card income reflecting the amortization of higher 
account origination costs, including promotional offers, 
while net interchange was relatively flat as the increase in  
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an 
increase to the rewards liability, and

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting the net 

impact of lower production margins and higher volumes,

partially offset by

• higher asset management fees related to the higher level 
of client investment assets on higher average market 
levels and net inflows.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical 
Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88, and Note 5 for 
additional information on card income. 

Noninterest revenue was $13.5 billion, up 2%, driven by:

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income 
reflecting the acceleration of debit and credit card sales 
volume in 2021, above pre-pandemic levels, and lower  
amortization costs related to new account originations,

• higher asset management fees related to the higher level 
of client investment assets on higher average market 
levels and net inflows, and 

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 5%, driven by:

production volumes,

• continued investments in the business, including 

offset by

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue as a result of a net 
loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior 
period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the 

decline in volume, and

• lower overdraft fees.

Noninterest expense was $21.5 billion, up 3%, reflecting:

• continued investments in the business, including 

marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing 
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the businesses, 

including performance-related compensation,

largely offset by

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the 

impact of higher vehicle collateral values

• lower structural expenses.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $5.9 
billion, compared with an expense of $12.4 billion in the 
prior year, driven by: 

• an $8.2 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 

losses, driven by improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, consisting of $6.2 billion in 
Card, $1.2 billion in Home Lending, primarily due to 
continued improvements in HPI expectations, $575 
million in CBB and $225 million in Auto, and 

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting 
from the impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs.

The prior year included an $8.7 billion addition to the 
allowance for credit losses.

marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing 
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the businesses, 

including performance-related compensation,

partially offset by 

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the 

impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $459 
million, compared with an expense of $795 million in the 
prior year, driven by:

• a $950 million reduction in the allowance for credit 

losses, reflecting improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook consisting of $850 million in 
Card and $100 million in CBB, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting 
from the residual impact of government stimulus and 
payment assistance programs.

The prior year included a $300 million reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $16.7 billion, up $12.8 billion, driven by a 
decrease in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $37.8 billion, a decrease of 2%.

Net interest income was $24.3 billion, down 4%, driven by:

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of higher 
payments and lower cumulative sales volume throughout 
2020 and the net impact of deposit margin compression 
and growth in CBB,

largely offset by

• lower funding costs in Card related to changes in portfolio 
mix and the impacts from PPP including the accelerated 
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan 
forgiveness in CBB.

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.6 billion, up 29% and includes a net 
benefit in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $12.4 billion, up 7%.
Banking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 30%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, up 45%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 52%, 
reflecting higher advisory and equity underwriting fees.
– Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, up 187%, driven by 

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 41%, 
driven by wallet share gains and increased activity in 
the IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 3%, 

driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily 
related to acquisition financing.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.6 billion, up 22%, 
and included gains on equity investments. Excluding 
these gains, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 10%, driven by 
higher deposit balances and fees, partially offset by 
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $244 million, down 27%, driven by 

lower net interest income.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.5 billion, 
down 4%. Markets revenue was $6.3 billion, down 5%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.7 billion, down 

20%, driven by lower revenue in Commodities, Rates and 
Spread products compared to a strong prior year, 
including an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the 
derivatives portfolio.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.6 billion, up 30%, driven 

by strong performance across prime brokerage, 
derivatives, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 9%, 

driven by growth in fees and deposit balances.

Noninterest expense was $5.9 billion, relatively flat  to the 
prior year, as higher structural expense, volume- and 
revenue- related expense and investments in the business, 
including technology and front office hires, were offset by 
lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $638 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with a net benefit of $81 million in the 
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $16.3 billion, up 39%, primarily reflecting 
the absence of an increase in the provision for credit losses  
in the prior year.
Net revenue was $40.2 billion, up 6%.
Banking revenue was $14.5 billion, up 27%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $9.3 billion, up 46%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 42%, 
reflecting higher fees across products. The Firm ranked 
#1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to 
Dealogic.
– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, up 84%, driven by 

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $3.2 billion, up 54%, 
driven by increased activity and wallet share gains in 
the IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $3.9 billion, up 16%, 
predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan 
market primarily related to acquisition financing.
• Wholesale Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, up 8% 
and included gains on equity investments. Excluding 
these gains, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 4%, driven by 
higher deposit balances and fees, largely offset by 
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $738 million, down 23%, driven by 
lower net interest income, partially offset by higher loan 
commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.7 billion, 
down 3%. Markets revenue was $22.1 billion, down 6%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $13.5 billion, down 
20%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies & 
Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and 
Commodities compared to a strong prior year, partially 
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $8.6 billion, up 30%, driven 

by strong performance across derivatives, prime 
brokerage, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%, with 

growth in deposits and fees, predominantly offset by 
deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $338 million 

largely driven by valuation adjustments related to 
derivatives. The prior year loss of $272 million was 
predominantly driven by losses on certain components of 
fair value option elected liabilities, as well as the impact 
of funding spread widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $19.5 billion, up 5%, 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, largely performance-related 
compensation, as well as higher structural expense, 
partially offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.0 
billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $3.3 billion in the 
prior year.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets 
revenue on page 74 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.4 billion, up 30%, largely driven by a 
decrease in the provision for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results
Net income was $4.0 billion, up $3.5 billion, predominantly 
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.5 billion, up 10%. Net interest income 
was $1.5 billion, up 1%, driven by the impact of lower 
funding costs on loans and higher deposit balances, largely 
offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue 
was $988 million, up 30%, driven by higher investment 
banking revenue and wholesale payments revenue. 

Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, up 7%, 
predominantly driven by higher investments in the business 
and higher volume- and revenue- related expense.      

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $363 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with a net benefit of $147 million in the 
prior year.  

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Net revenue was $7.4 billion, up 8%. Net interest income 
was $4.5 billion, down 3%, driven by deposit margin 
compression, offset by the impact of lower funding costs on 
loans and higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
$2.9 billion, up 30%, predominantly driven by higher 
investment banking revenue and wholesale payments 
revenue.

Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, up 5%, driven by 
higher investments in the business and higher volume- and 
revenue-related expense. 

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $858 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $3.3 billion in the 
prior year.

(a) In the first quarter of 2021, the Wealth Management business was renamed Global Private Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2020, certain wealth 

management clients were transferred from AWM Global Private Bank to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management unit in CCB’s Consumer & Business Banking 
business. For further information see page 80 of the 2020 Form 10-K.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 36%.

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up 21%. Net interest income 
was $988 million, up 21%. Noninterest revenue was $3.3 
billion, up 21%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3 billion, up 21%, 
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on cumulative net inflows 

into long-term products and higher average market 
levels, net of liquidity fee waivers; and higher 
performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.0 billion, up 
20%, predominantly driven by:
• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 

management fees, as well as the impact of lower funding 
costs on loans, partially offset by deposit margin 
compression.

Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 13% 
predominantly driven by higher performance-related 
compensation, distribution fees, and structural expense.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $3.6 billion, an increase of 63%.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, an increase of 20%. Net 
interest income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. Noninterest 
revenue was $9.6 billion, up 23%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $6.8 billion, up 24%, 
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net 
inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher 
average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers; and 
higher net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.7 billion, up 
16%, predominantly driven by:

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 

management fees, as well as the impact of lower funding 
costs on loans, partially offset by deposit margin 
compression.

Noninterest expense was $7.9 billion, an increase of 10%, 
predominantly driven by performance-related 
compensation and distribution fees. 

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $191 
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $265 million in the 
prior year.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.
Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer group 
quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled 
funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, for which the source 
remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund 
performance utilizing this peer group ranking and believes that it provides 
investors with comparability across the industry. This change resulted in 
positive impacts on the quartile rankings shown in the following table, and 
both positive and negative impacts on the quartile rankings for prior periods, 
as compared to how they would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, 
AWM has changed its selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent 
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table have 
been revised to conform to the current presentation.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- 

or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best 
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-
star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-
star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-
wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a 
weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- 
and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share 
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted 
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not 
rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned 
peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are 
sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the 
fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for 
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the 
star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides 
ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if 
all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked 

in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile 
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive 
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile 
rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where 
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. 
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and 
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, 
at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., 
Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other 
funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes 
had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc 
share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not 
available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $64 million and $62 million for the three months ended 

September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $197 million and $186 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and risk management employees were transferred from Corporate to CIB.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $817 million compared with a net loss of $699 
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957 million, 
driven by:

• limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth 

continued,

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS, and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments, 

compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to 

derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination 
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and 
CIO

Noninterest expense of $160 million was down $559 
million primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on 
a legacy investment in the prior year and lower structural 
expense.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly 
driven by an income tax benefit of $383 million related to 
finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return and the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $2.6 billion compared with a net loss of $1.4 
billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $2.9 billion, compared with a loss 
of $927 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower 
net interest income on limited deployment opportunities as 
deposit growth continued.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS,

predominantly offset by

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash 
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were

more than offset by the related net interest income 
earned on these transactions, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early 
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in 
Treasury and CIO and derivatives in Other Corporate

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion was up $539 million  
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation and higher legal and technology expense, 
partially offset by the absence of an impairment on a legacy 
investment in the prior year.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, the impact of the 
Firm's estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the 
level of year-to-date pretax income, as well as an income 
tax benefit of $383 million related to finalizing the Firm's 
2020 U.S. federal tax return.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

• Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.

47

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 

The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies 
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approaches compared to their respective 
minimum capital ratios. 

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding 
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to 
SLR on page 51 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their 
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided 
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of 
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a 

three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 
(“CECL capital transition provisions”). 

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended 
September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm 
exclude $3.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact 
to retained earnings and 25% of the $1.9 billion increase 
in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).  

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk 
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL 
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting 
guidance.  

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued 
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of 
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by 
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated 
under the program. The Firm does not expect to realize 
material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are 
guaranteed by the SBA. As of September 30, 2021, the 
Firm had approximately $13 billion of loans remaining 
under the program. 

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them 
under the final rule.  

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing 
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based 
capital metrics.

dividend, which increased to $1.00 per share from $0.90 
per share, effective with the dividend payable on October 
31, 2021. The Firm’s dividends are subject to approval by 
the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced 
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. 
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of 
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase 
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal 
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends 
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and 
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the 
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire 
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 
2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") 
stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject

Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement of 3.2% (down from 
3.3%) and the Firm's minimum Standardized CET1 capital 
ratio of 11.2% (down from 11.3%). The 2021 SCB 
requirement became effective on October 1, 2021 and will 
remain in effect until September 30, 2022.

rules, each of which have implemented Basel III and thereby 
subject J.P. Morgan Securities plc to its requirements.

Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 101 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
on J.P. Morgan Securities plc. 

The Bank of England requires, on a transitional basis, that 
U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas 
groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (“MREL”). As of September 30, 2021, 
J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the 
requirements of the MREL rule.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR 
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk 
Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports 
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 
2020 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR 
framework.

Reserve Banks. 

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, 
and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or 
purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment 
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the three-
month period ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an 

increase in cash from long-term debt issuances during the 
second quarter 2021.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the prior year 
period primarily due to the relative impact on net cash 
outflows from the significant increase in deposits.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared 
with both the three month periods ended June 30, 2021 
and September 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in 
deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the third quarter 
primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in 
excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded 
from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable 
securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm 
believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes 
excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair 
value of these securities was approximately $878 billion 
and $740 billion as of September 30, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of 
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on 
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased 
compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in 
excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which 
was primarily a result of higher deposits as well as an 
increase in CIB trading assets.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral 
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $303 
billion and $307 billion as of September 30, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity 
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the 
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that 
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and other central banks. Although available, the 
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks 
as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies 

54

 
 
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking 
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% 
on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective 
on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly 
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 

Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of 

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. are compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR, 
based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule.

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.  

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of September 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020, and the average deposit balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of 
total liabilities, as of September 30, 2021 and

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of 
market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three and nine months 
ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine 
months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting significant 
inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of 
certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth 
from existing and new accounts across both consumer and 
small business customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on 
pages 22-46 and pages 16-17, respectively, for further

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist 
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale 
commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at 
September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to 
lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity 
management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at 
September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020, and for 
the average three and nine months ended September 30, 
2021 compared to the prior year period, was primarily due 
to net issuances of structured notes and higher overdrafts 
in CIB Markets.

MMLF.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at September 30, 2021, compared with December 31, 
2020, reflecting the impact of client activities and secured 
financing of trading assets in CIB Markets, partially offset by 
lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured 
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary 
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC 
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The 
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance 
and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine 
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 19, and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 61-76 for a further 
discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 77 for a further discussion of Investment 
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk 
Management on pages 110–134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit and 
Investment Risk Management framework.

through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage  
credit exposures. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform 
with the current presentation.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current 

presentation.

(d) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming 

assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured 
by U.S. government agencies of $644 million and $874 million, 
respectively, and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $5 million and $9 million, respectively. These 
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans 
from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory 
guidance.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered troubled debt 
restructurings (“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of 
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for 
those customers and clients who would have otherwise 
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 and Wholesale 
Credit Portfolio on pages 66-74 for information on loan 
modifications as of September 30, 2021. Refer to Notes 12 
and 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further 
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan 
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm 
had approximately $13 billion and $27 billion, respectively,  
of PPP loans remaining, including $11 billion and $19 
billion, respectively, in the consumer portfolio, and $2 
billion and $8 billion, respectively, in the wholesale 
portfolio. Since inception of the Program, the Firm funded 
approximately $40 billion of loans. The PPP ended on May 
31, 2021 for new applications. 

The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and 
through September 30, 2021, approximately $27 billion of 
loans were forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated 
recognition in interest income of the associated deferred 
processing fees, primarily in CCB.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28 and Credit 
Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-
K for a further discussion on the PPP.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime 
segment of the consumer credit market. The macroeconomic environment continued to improve in 2021, with the credit 
performance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefiting from government stimulus programs, payment 
deferral programs and increasing home prices. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 
114-120 and Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s 
nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 
10-K for further information on lending-related commitments.

Consumer assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. During the 
third quarter of 2021, there were approximately $390 
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral 
programs.
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $3.7 
billion of retained consumer loans under payment deferral 
programs, a decrease of approximately $24.6 billion from 
June 30, 2020. The loans under deferral were predominantly 
in residential real estate.  Predominantly all borrowers that 
exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm 
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans 
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period 
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to 
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

Of the $3.7 billion of retained loans still under payment 
deferral programs as of September 30, 2021, approximately 
$1.6 billion were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment 
deferral and approximately $100 million were accounted for 
as TDRs because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not 
elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance 
provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act. Borrowers that are unable to resume or 
continue making payments in accordance with the original or 
modified contractual terms of their agreements upon exit 
from deferral programs will be placed on nonaccrual status 
in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit 
cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and the loans 
charged off or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off 
policies. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 
10-K for additional information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and 
charge-off policies.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2020 driven by higher 
residential real estate loans at fair value, partially offset by 
lower retained residential real estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans declined from December 31, 2020 due to 
paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage loans 
in Home Lending, largely offset by growth in AWM. Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2020 
reflecting improved credit performance. The three and nine 
month periods ending September 30, 2021 reflected net 
recoveries benefiting from further improvement in HPI and 
higher reversals of prior write-downs due to loan 
prepayments as a result of the low rate environment 
compared to net charge-offs for the three months ended 
September 30, 2020, and lower net recoveries for the nine 
months ended September 30, 2020.  In addition, the nine 
months ended September 30, 2020 included a recovery on 
a loan sale.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2020, 
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher 
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home 
Lending due to the continued low rate environment. 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 
31, 2020 due to sales in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $19.8 billion at September 30, 2021. This 
amount included $6.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $6.4 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the 
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans 
were $27.8 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These 
loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing 
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as 
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, 
predominantly in AWM. Net recoveries and charge-offs for 
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, 
respectively, were not material, as the credit performance 
of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of 
the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has 
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of 
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act 
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer

(a) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $9 million and $7 

million of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in

(i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such 
loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie 
Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan 
pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to 
foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information about sales of 
loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.

(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans 

included $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers 
were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s

TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio was relatively flat when 
compared with December 31, 2020 due to growth in the 
scored auto portfolio predominantly offset by a decrease in 
business banking loans. The increase in the scored auto 
portfolio was predominantly driven by loan originations 
largely offset by paydowns. Business Banking loans declined 
due to PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns largely offset by 
loan originations. Net charge offs for the three months 
ended September 30, 2021 increased when compared to 
the same period in the prior year primarily due to 
overdrafts. Net charge offs for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2021 decreased when compared to the 
same period in the prior year primarily due to lower auto 
charge-offs as the current year had a greater benefit from 
government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and 
higher vehicle collateral values. The scored auto portfolio 
net charge-off rates were 0.03% and 0.04% for the three 
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively, and 0.01% and 0.28% for the nine months 
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Credit card
Total credit card loans were relatively flat from 
December 31, 2020 reflecting higher payments, offset by 
strong sales volume in the second and third quarters of 
2021. The September 30, 2021 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.00% and 0.49%, respectively, 
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%, 
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to be 
positively impacted by government stimulus and support 
provided to borrowers who participated in payment 
assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased for the 
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 
compared with the  prior year periods reflecting lower 
charge-offs and higher recoveries as consumer cash 
balances remained elevated benefiting from the impact of 
government stimulus and payment assistance programs.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At September 30, 2021, the Firm had $1.1 billion of credit 
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, 
which does not include loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, 
compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to 
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification 
programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 68-71 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the credit 
environment continued to improve following the broad-
based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of September 30, 2021, retained loans increased $17.8 
billion driven by CIB and AWM partially offset by decreases 
in CB and CCB. In CB, the decrease was largely driven by a 
net decrease in PPP loans. Lending-related commitments 
increased $49.4 billion, predominantly driven by net 
portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held 
for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the 
investment-grade percentage of the credit portfolio 
decreased from 71% to 70% driven by net portfolio 
activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure 
was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020. Nonperforming exposure decreased 
$814 million driven by lower nonperforming loans, largely 
in Oil & Gas and Individuals and Individual Entities, with net 
portfolio activity and select upgrades being partially offset 
by select downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans 
was partially offset by an increase in nonperforming 
derivatives. Net charge-offs were $100 million.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current 

presentation.

(d) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021, 
predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form 
of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $177 million of retained loans under payment deferral, which decreased 
from $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans. The 
Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an 
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of 
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals 
and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they 
qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of September 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/
Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal 
risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk 
ratings.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on 
which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit 
portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the 
retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative 
contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market 
conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the 
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and  December 31, 2020, representing approximately 3.8% and 4.0% 
of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively, as select downgrades were offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity. 
The total criticized exposure at September 30, 2021 was largely undrawn and $38.5 billion was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The 
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of 
JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas exposure was $46.2 billion as of September 30, 2021, including $27.2 billion of Exploration & Production and Oil 
field Services as shown in the table below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the investment-grade 
percentage decreased from 47% to 41%, predominantly driven by increased noninvestment-grade derivative receivables 
resulting from market movements related to Oil & Gas prices. However, criticized exposure decreased by $2.4 billion from 
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.3 billion at September 30, 2021, driven by net portfolio activity and select upgrades 
partially offset by select downgrades.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88% at both September 30, 2021, 
and December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. 
Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative 
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $67.9 billion and $75.4 
billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, with decreases primarily driven by maturities 
of certain trades in CIB. Derivative receivables represent the 
fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to 
legally enforceable master netting agreements and the 
related cash collateral held by the Firm. 

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and 
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s 
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the 
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the 
definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR 
rule. 

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but 
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net 
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Information on credit portfolio management 
activities is provided in the table below.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 
Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies 
and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for 
credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and 
investment securities.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 86-88 for further information on the allowance for 
credit losses and related management judgments.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
reflected within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021 
was $20.5 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at 
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses reflected:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic 
variables (“MEVs”) used in the Firm's allowance estimate 
which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit 
loss estimates, increased the reliance on management 
judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately 
address the economic circumstances. These adjustments 
continued through the third quarter of 2021, although to a 
lesser extent than experienced during 2020.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the 
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse 
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the 
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may 
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of 
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on 
certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm 
retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in 
the third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of 
2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of 
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive 
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions 
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial 
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. 
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended 
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for 
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At September 30, 2021, 
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $593.0 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 44-46 and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 78-82 for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
54-58 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership 
interests or other forms of junior capital and span multiple 
asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated 
investing businesses or as part of a broader business 
strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-
oriented investments and investments made to enhance or 
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those 
that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. The 
Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its 
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support 
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the 
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly 
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as September 30, 2021 
and December 31, 2020.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 85.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. 

Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 

benefit is not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three 
months ended September 30, 2021 when compared with 
June 30, 2021. This was due to volatility rolling out of the 
one-year historical look-back period impacting exposures in 
commodities, as well as risk reductions in equities.

Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $54 million for the three 
months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the 
same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by 
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical look-back 
period, predominantly impacting exposures in fixed income 
and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. As noted previously, average total VaR 
decreased by $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year. 
Daily Risk Management VaR has returned to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in late March of 2020 at the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset 
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of the 259 days, and observed eight 
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 
66 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended September 30, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the 
chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information).

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
September 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 
reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-
term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s 
balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of 
September 30, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could 
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never 
experienced an interest rate environment where the 
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. In a 
negative interest rate environment, the modeling 
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require 
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual 
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario

levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at 
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and 
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities 
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any 
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts do not currently include assumptions to 
account for the reversal of Quantitative Easing in the 12-
month horizon for earnings-at-risk.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net 
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to 
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for 
additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries.

Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021 and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.

The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased 
cash placements with the central bank of Australia in the 
first quarter of 2021, predominantly driven by client 
activity following policy decisions in the country and growth 
in client deposits.

Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues 
to leverage use of remote access and video conferencing 
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote 
work. As a result, the Firm has deployed additional 
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud has normalized since the 
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to employ various 
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as 
providing employee and client education and awareness 
trainings. 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk 
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected 
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism 
and health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees 
and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide 
resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover 
its critical business functions and supporting assets (e.g., 
people, technology, data and facilities) in the event of a 
business interruption. The program includes governance, 
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as 
well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, 
and manage business interruption and public safety risks. 
The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency 
program has played an integral role in maintaining the 
Firm’s business operations during and after various events.

84

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 86-88 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-76 and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across 
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market 
and weak overall economic conditions that affected 
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios. 

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the 
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse 
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the 
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may 
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of 
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on 
certain sectors. Judgment is still required to estimate the 
speed and trajectory of the economic recovery. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 
approximately 2.3% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, 
with a peak difference of approximately 3.7% in the first 
quarter of 2022; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower 
recovery, remaining nearly 2.7% lower at the end of the 

86

eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 5.9% in the first quarter of 2022; and lower 
national HPI with a peak difference of nearly 14.4% and 
forecasted trough, both in the first quarter of 2023.

consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2021.

Fair value  
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $6.8 billion 
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the 
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation 
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:

• the Firm continues to place meaningful weighting on its 
adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit 
losses as of September 30, 2021, and accordingly, the 
existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond 
those estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in 

the Firm's allowance estimate, which has created 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimations 

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration 

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, effects of government support and customer 
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2021, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its 
adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated 
effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s 
allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the 
comparison between these two scenarios reflects the 
following differences:

• An increase of approximately $350 million for residential 

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.6 billion for credit card 

loans

• An increase of approximately $2.1 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments 

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on 
page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
September 30, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $9.4 billion and $7.7 
billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers 
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser 
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions. Refer 
to page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, 
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 154-155 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021

Standard

Summary of guidance 

Effects on financial statements

• Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 

7, 2021 update was effective when issued. 

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical 
expedients related to contract modifications and 
hedge accounting relationships, and discounting 
transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. 
The discounting transition election was applied 
retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical 
expedients is to ease the administrative burden of 
accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate 
reform. These elections did not have a material 
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and 
updated 
January 2021

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to 
current accounting guidance when financial 
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and 
other transactions are amended due to reference 
rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain 

contract amendments related to reference rate 
reform as modifications rather than 
extinguishments without the requirement to 
assess the significance of the amendments.  

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge 
accounting relationship without automatic 
termination of that relationship. Provides various 
practical expedients and elections designed to 
allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted 
during the transition period.  

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities 
out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain 
criteria are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to 
account for derivatives modified to change the 
rate used for discounting, margining, or contract 
price alignment (collectively “discounting 
transition”) as modifications.
