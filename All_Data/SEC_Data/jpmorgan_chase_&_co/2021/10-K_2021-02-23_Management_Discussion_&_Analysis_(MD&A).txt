on pages 52-53 and Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for additional
information.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the full year of
2020 versus the full year of 2019, unless otherwise specified.
Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $29.1 billion for 2020, or
$8.88 per share, on net revenue of $119.5 billion. The Firm
reported ROE of 12% and ROTCE of 14%. The Firm's results for
2020 included net additions to the allowance for credit losses of
$12.2 billion and Firmwide legal expense of $1.1 billion.
• The Firm had net income of $29.1 billion, down 20%.
• Total net revenue was up 4%. Noninterest revenue was $65.0

billion, up 12%, driven by higher CIB Markets revenue,
Investment Banking fees and net production revenue in Home
Lending. Net interest income was $54.6 billion, down 5%, driven
by the impact of lower rates,

predominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB
Markets as well as balance sheet growth.

• Noninterest expense was $66.7 billion, up 2%, driven by higher

volume- and revenue-related expense, legal expense and
continued investments in the businesses, partially offset by lower
structural expense.

• The provision for credit losses was $17.5 billion, up $11.9 billion
from the prior year, driven by net additions to the allowance for
credit losses of $12.2 billion due to the deterioration and
increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

December 31, 2020. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses
to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.95%, compared with 1.39%
in the prior year; the increase from the prior year was driven by
the additions to the allowance for credit losses and the adoption
of CECL.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at

December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.9 billion from the prior
year, primarily reflecting client credit deterioration across
multiple industries in the wholesale portfolio; and in the
consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the adoption
of CECL, as the purchased credit deteriorated loans in the
mortgage portfolio became subject to nonaccrual loan treatment.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, nonperforming assets decreased
$556 million from the prior quarter, reflecting some credit
improvement in the wholesale portfolio. The consumer portfolio
remained relatively flat, as the increase in loans placed on
nonaccrual status in Home Lending related to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic was predominantly offset by lower loans at
fair value in CIB, largely due to sales.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, driven by

higher loan balances in AWM and CIB, as well as loans
originated under the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”)
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), predominantly offset by
lower loan balances in Home Lending and Card.

• Firmwide average deposits of $1.9 trillion were up 25%,

reflecting significant inflows across the Firm, primarily driven by
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of
certain government actions.

• As of December 31, 2020, the Firm had average eligible High

Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697 billion and
unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of
approximately $740 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion
of liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 102–108 for additional information.

2021 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and
are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-
Looking Statements on page 157, and the Risk Factors section on
pages 8-32 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K, for a further discussion

assurance that actual results in 2021 will be in line with the outlook
set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2021 should be viewed
against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the
COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets activity, the geopolitical
environment, the competitive environment, client and customer
activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of
these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs.
The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its
businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments
in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in
which it operates. The outlook information contained in this Form
10-K supersedes all outlook information included in the Firm’s
periodic reports furnished or filed with the SEC prior to the date of
this Form 10-K.

Full-year 2021
• Management expects net interest income, on a managed basis,

to be approximately $55 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $69
billion, which includes accelerated contributions to the Firm’s

Management’s discussion and analysis

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Firm invoked
resiliency plans to allow its businesses to remain operational,
utilizing disaster recovery sites and implementing alternative work
arrangements globally.

Additionally, the Firm implemented strategies and procedures
designed to help it respond to increased market volatility, client
demand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain industries and
the ongoing impacts to consumers and businesses.

Throughout 2020, the Firm remained focused on serving its
clients, customers and communities, as well as the well-being of
its employees, during the pandemic. The Firm continues to actively
monitor the health and safety situations at local and regional
levels, and will continue to adapt as these situations evolve.

Supporting clients and customers
The Firm has supported its clients and customers during the
challenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by
providing assistance, primarily in the form of payment deferrals on
loans and extending credit, including through its participation in the
Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) PPP.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 112 for information on assistance
granted to customers and clients. Refer to Consumer Credit
portfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on page 122
for information on retained loans under payment deferral.

The Firm has gradually re-opened its branches since April 2020,
with nearly 90% of its branches returning to full service as of
December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Firm continues to provide a
wide range of banking services that are accessible to clients and
customers through mobile and other digital channels.

Protecting and supporting employees
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm implemented
alternative work arrangements, with the vast majority of its global
workforce working from home since the onset of the pandemic and
continuing into the first quarter of 2021. The Firm also provided
additional benefits to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supporting communities
Since March, the Firm has committed $250 million to help address
humanitarian needs and long-term economic challenges posed by
the COVID-19 pandemic on the communities in which the Firm
operates. As of December 31, 2020, over 75% of this commitment
has been funded.

Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to
as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31, 2020. The U.K. and
the EU have entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement
which delineates many significant aspects of the future
relationship between the U.K. and the EU. However, the
agreement contained very limited provisions relating to cross-
border financial services, and the U.K. and the EU are expected to
engage in further negotiations concerning financial services.

The Firm has executed and continues to execute on its Firmwide
Brexit Implementation program, which encompasses a strategic
implementation plan across all impacted businesses and functions,
including an ongoing assessment of political, legal and regulatory
and other implementation risks. A key focus of the program has
been to ensure continuity of service to the Firm’s EU clients in the
following areas: regulatory and legal entities; clients; and business
and operations.

Regulatory and legal entities
The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are
now licensed to provide and are providing services to the Firm’s
EU clients, including through a branch network covering locations
such as Paris, Madrid and Milan. Subject to limited exceptions, the
Firm’s U.K.-based legal entities are no longer permitted to transact
business from the U.K. with EU clients.

Clients
Agreements covering substantially all of the Firm’s EU client
activity have been re-documented to EU legal entities to facilitate
continuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with
those clients that have not completed re-documentation or
required operational changes.

Business and operations
The COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional risk to the Firm’s
Brexit Implementation program, particularly in relation to staff
relocations. As a result, the Firm has worked closely with
regulators and employees to ensure that critical staff are relocated
in a safe and timely manner so that the Firm can meet its
regulatory commitments and continue serving its clients. Further
relocations are planned for 2021, and the Firm’s longer-term EU
staffing strategy will be developed over time in cooperation with its
regulators and as the post-Brexit market landscape evolves in
order to ensure that the Firm maintains operational resilience and
effective client coverage.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to make
progress in preparing for the discontinuation of the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs to comply with
the International Organization of Securities Commission’s
standards for transaction-based benchmark rates.

On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the
administrator of LIBOR, announced a public consultation on its
proposal to cease the publication of the principal tenors of U.S.
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month
and 12-month LIBOR) immediately following a final publication on
June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC also
released guidance encouraging market participants to cease
dealing in new U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts from the end of 2021.
There has been no change in the scheduled cessation of U.K.
sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, or the
remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, from December 31, 2021.

The Firm continues to work towards reducing its exposure to
IBOR-referencing contracts, including derivatives, bilateral and
syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock
issuances, to meet the industry milestones and recommendations
published by National Working Groups (“NWG”), including the
Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”) in the U.S.

On October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) published a new supplement to the ISDA
2006 definitions and the related 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol
(the “Protocol”). These publications are intended to facilitate the
incorporation of robust rate fallback provisions into both legacy
and new derivative contracts with effect from January 25, 2021.
The Firm’s client-facing legal entities have agreed to adhere to the
Protocol, in accordance with recommendations from multiple
industry working groups, including the ARRC. ISDA further
announced that bilateral templates have been made available for
use with counterparties who choose not to adhere to the Protocol.

As a key objective of the ARRC’s transition plan to encourage
adoption of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”),
counterparty clearing houses, clearing house members and other
impacted market participants successfully executed the
discounting and price alignment interest (“PAI”) switch from federal
funds to SOFR on October 16, 2020. The industry completed a
similar switch from EONIA to €STR on July 27, 2020.

On March 12, 2020 and January 7, 2021, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting standards updates
providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying
generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedge
accounting relationships affected by reference rate reform. These
optional expedients are intended to simplify the operational impact
of applying U.S. GAAP to transactions impacted by reference rate
reform. The Firm elected to apply certain of these expedients
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. On

August 27, 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”) issued guidance that provides similar relief for entities
reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS"). Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on
page 156 for additional information. The Firm continues to monitor
the transition relief being considered by the U.S. Treasury
Department regarding the tax implications of reference rate reform.

The Firm’s initiatives in connection with LIBOR transition include:

• continuing to reduce its overall exposure to LIBOR

• implementing rate fallback provisions developed by NWGs in

new LIBOR contracts, where appropriate

• continuing to educate and inform clients on LIBOR transition and

the necessity to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR

• assisting clients with discontinuing their issuance or use of

LIBOR-linked products within the timelines specified by NWGs

• supporting clients in their efforts to remediate contracts linked to
LIBOR, including contracts to which the Firm is a party, which it
manages or for which it acts as agent

• offering products linked to alternative reference rates (“ARRs”)

across its businesses, and

• planning for the implementation of rate fallback mechanisms
across products based on the conventions recommended by
NWGs to prepare for transition to ARRs upon the cessation of
various IBORs.

The Firm is on schedule to implement necessary changes to
operational and risk management systems in order to transition
away from IBORs, including by aiming to meet proposed deadlines
set by NWGs for the cessation of new contracts referencing these
benchmarks. The Firm continues to engage with and remains
committed to NWGs in devising solutions to unresolved issues
relating to IBOR transition.

The Firm continues to engage with market participants, NWGs and
regulators to address market-wide challenges associated with
LIBOR transition, including efforts to:

• improve liquidity in ARRs

• develop and introduce forward-looking term rates linked to

ARRs, and

• support legislative proposals in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU

that aim to resolve concerns involving “tough legacy” contracts
(i.e. contracts that do not provide for automatic conversion to
another rate or that are difficult to amend in order to add rate
fallback provisions).

Resolution of these challenges should provide more certainty and
help to provide a framework for market participants in transitioning
away from IBORs.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic
Since March 2020, the U.S. government as well as central banks
and banking authorities around the world have taken and continue
to take actions to help individuals, households and businesses that
have been adversely affected by the economic disruption caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act and the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, which were signed into law on
March 27, 2020 and December 27, 2020, respectively, provide,
among other things, funding to support loan facilities to assist
consumers and businesses. Set forth below is a summary as of
the date of this Form 10-K of U.S. government actions currently
impacting the Firm and U.S. government programs in which the
Firm is participating. The Firm will continue to assess ongoing
developments in government actions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.

U.S. government actions
Eligible retained income definition. On March 17, 2020, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”),
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),
collectively the “federal banking agencies,” issued an interim final
rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that revised the definition
of “eligible retained income” in the regulatory capital rules that
apply to all U.S. banking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule (issued as final on
August 26, 2020) that revised the definition of “eligible retained
income” for purposes of the total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”)
buffer requirements that apply to global systemically important
banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained
income makes any automatic limitations on payout distributions
that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules or TLAC rule
take effect on a more graduated basis in the event that a banking
organization’s capital, leverage and TLAC ratios were to decline
below regulatory requirements (including buffers). The March 17,
2020 interim final rule was issued, in conjunction with an
interagency statement encouraging banking organizations to use
their capital and liquidity buffers, to further support banking
organizations’ abilities to lend to households and businesses
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reserve requirements. On March 24, 2020, the Federal Reserve
issued an interim final rule (issued as final on December 22, 2020)
reducing reserve requirement ratios for all depository institutions to
zero percent, effective March 26, 2020, an action intended to free
up liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households
and businesses.

Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the reduction to the
reserve requirement.

Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”)
transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies
issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020)
that provided banking organizations with the option to delay the
effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a
three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”).
The Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions.

Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary revision. On April
1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that
requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage
exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding
companies (“BHC”), to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of
U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.
These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and will remain
in effect through March 31, 2021.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and Note 27
for additional information on the CECL capital transition provisions,
the impact to the Firm’s capital metrics and the Firm’s SLR.

Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies
along with the National Credit Union Administration, and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the
state financial regulators, issued an interagency statement revising
a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan modifications and
the reporting for financial institutions working with customers
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA
Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with borrowers where
the loans are prudently underwritten, and not considered past due
or carried on nonaccrual status, should not result in the loans
automatically being considered modified in a troubled debt
restructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting
purposes, or for purposes of their respective risk-based capital
rules, which would otherwise require financial institutions subject
to the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA Statement also
clarified the interaction between its previous guidance and Section
4013 of the CARES Act, as extended by Section 541 of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provides certain financial
institutions with the option to suspend the application of
accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for loan
modifications made to address the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic.

The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the
Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been
considered TDRs because:

• they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications,

whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments
or the IA Statement guidance, or

• the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the

application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by

52

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the
above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on pages 112-113 and Note 12 for additional
information on the Firm’s loan modification activities.

PPP. Beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP, established by the CARES
Act and administered by the SBA, authorized eligible lenders to
provide nonrecourse loans to eligible borrowers until August 8,
2020 to provide an incentive for these businesses to keep their
workers on their payroll. As part of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, additional funding was provided for new PPP
loans beginning in early January 2021. This program was
designed to target smaller businesses as well as to simplify the
loan forgiveness process for loans under $150,000. As of
February 19, 2021, the Firm has funded approximately $5 billion
under this extension of the program.

U.S. government facilities. Beginning in March 2020, the Federal
Reserve announced a suite of facilities using its emergency
lending powers under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to
support the flow of credit to individuals, households and
businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to
support the broader economy.

The Firm has participated and is participating in the PPP and
certain of the other government facilities and programs, as
needed, to assist its clients and customers or to support the
broader economy. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages
91-101, Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108, Credit
Portfolio on pages 112-113, Note 12 and Note 27 for additional
information on the Firm’s participation in the PPP and other
government facilities and programs.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset

management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees.
Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card
reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no
effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

(c) Included operating lease income of $5.5 billion for each of the years ended

December 31, 2020 and 2019, and $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018.

2020 compared with 2019
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB, reflecting:

• higher equity underwriting fees predominantly in follow-on

offerings and convertible securities markets due to increased
industry-wide fees

• higher debt underwriting fees in investment-grade and high-yield
bonds driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet share
gains. The increased activity resulted in part from clients seeking
liquidity in the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 71–76 and Note 6 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, predominantly in CIB,
reflecting higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by
strong performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates, and
Credit.
The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected
higher net valuations on several legacy equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have
offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.
The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business
on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 71–76 and
pages 83–84, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a result of
lower deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction
activity and the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19
pandemic, predominantly offset by higher cash management fees
in CIB and CB, as well as higher lending-related fees, particularly
loan commitment fees in CIB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 67–70,
pages 71–76 and pages 77–79, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions revenue
increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of net inflows
into liquidity and long term products, and higher performance
fees; and in CCB related to a higher level of investment assets

• higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher client-

driven volume,

partially offset by

• lower volume of annuity sales in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 67–70,
pages 71–76 and pages 80–82, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information.

Investment securities gains/(losses) increased due to the
repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, including sales
of U.S. GSE and government agency mortgage-backed securities,
particularly in the first and third quarters of 2020. Refer to
Corporate segment results on pages 83–84 and Note 10 for
additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to higher net
mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage
production volumes and margins; the prior year included gains on
sales of certain loans.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 67–70, Note 6 and 15 for
further information.

54

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Card income decreased due to:

• lower net interchange income reflecting lower credit card sales
volumes and debit card transactions as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, largely offset by lower acquisition
costs and higher annual fees in CCB, and

• lower merchant processing fees in CIB predominantly driven by
a reporting reclassification of certain expenses to be a reduction
of revenue in Merchant Services. Refer to CCB and CIB
segment results on pages 67–70 and pages 71–76, respectively,
and Note 6 for further information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• Increased amortization on higher levels of alternative energy

investments in CIB. The increased amortization was more than
offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax
credits

• lower net valuation gains on certain investments in AWM

• net losses on certain equity investments in CIB, compared with

net gains in the prior year

• higher costs associated with using forward contracts to hedge

certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment exposures,
and

• higher losses related to the early termination of certain of the

Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO,

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. In
conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and
lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio
segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied
when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to
conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

2020 compared with 2019
The provision for credit losses increased in consumer and
wholesale primarily driven by the deterioration and uncertainty in
the macroeconomic environment, in particular in the first half of
2020, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in consumer reflected:
• net additions of $7.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses,
consisting of $6.6 billion for Card, $520 million for Auto, $252
million for Business Banking,

partially offset by

partially offset by

• a net increase from a gain on an equity investment.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of lower rates,
predominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets,
as well as balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.8 trillion, up
$434 billion, and the yield was 2.34%, down 127 basis points
(“bps”), primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on these assets,
on an FTE basis, was 1.98%, a decrease of 48 bps. The net yield
excluding CIB Markets was 2.30%, down 97 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and
rates schedule on pages 300–304 for further details; and the
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on pages 62–64 for a further discussion of Net
interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs

and higher recoveries, primarily benefiting from payment
assistance and government stimulus.

The prior year included a $244 million net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

The increase in wholesale reflected a net addition of $4.7 billion
to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs, impacting
multiple industries.
The investment securities provision for credit losses relates to
the HTM portfolio, which became subject to
the CECL accounting guidance beginning on January 1, 2020.
Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 67–70, CIB on
pages 71–76, CB on pages 77–79, AWM on pages 80–82, the
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 132-133, and Notes 1, 10

allowance for credit losses.

(b) Included Firmwide legal expense of $1.1 billion, $239 million and $72 million for

the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(c) Included FDIC-related expense of $717 million, $457 million and $1.2 billion for

the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

2020 compared with 2019
Compensation expense increased driven by higher volume-and
revenue-related expense, predominantly in CIB and CCB, as well
as the impact of investments in the businesses.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher legal expense predominantly in CIB and AWM

• higher volume-related expense, in particular brokerage expense
in CIB and depreciation from growth in auto lease assets in CCB

• higher investments in the businesses, including technology and

real estate,

• an impairment on a legacy investment in Corporate, and

• higher FDIC-related expense,

partially offset by

• lower marketing expense as a result of lower investments in

marketing campaigns and lower travel-related benefits in CCB,
and

• lower structural expense, including lower travel and

entertainment across the businesses, and payment processing
costs, partially offset by higher contributions to the Firm’s
Foundation.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period

amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increased
primarily as a result of significant deposit inflows, which also funded
asset growth across the Firm, including investment securities and
securities purchased under resale agreements. Deposits with banks
reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central
banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased as a result of higher deployment of cash in
Treasury and CIO, as well as the impact of client activity and higher
demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 11 for
additional information.
Securities borrowed increased driven by client-driven activities in
CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and
Note 11 for additional information.
Trading assets remained elevated at the end of 2020, due to
stronger client-driven market-making activities in debt and equity
instruments and higher derivative receivables as a result of market
movements in CIB Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.
Investment securities increased, reflecting net purchases of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS in the
available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio, driven by interest rate risk
management activities and cash deployment. AFS securities of
$164 billion were transferred to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
portfolio, resulting in a decrease in AFS and a comparable increase
in HTM securities. The transfers were executed for capital
management purposes. Refer to

Corporate segment results on pages 83–84, Investment Portfolio
Risk Management on page 134 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional
information on investment securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• growth in wholesale loans and mortgages in AWM and the impact
of PPP loans in CBB and CB, as well as higher wholesale loans
related to client-driven activities in CIB Markets

largely offset by
• lower loans in Home Lending primarily due to net paydowns; and

lower loans in Card due to the decline in sales volumes that
began in March as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.

The allowance for loan losses increased primarily reflecting the
deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, in
particular in the first half of 2020, as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of:
• a net $7.4 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the credit

card portfolio, and

• a net $3.6 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs,

impacting multiple industries.

The adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $4.2 billion
addition to the allowance for loan losses.
There were also additions to the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets, of $1.1 billion related to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, and $98 million related to the adoption of
CECL. Total additions to the allowance for

credit losses were $12.1 billion related to COVID-19, and $4.3
billion related to CECL, as of December 31, 2020.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 110–
134, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion of loans and
the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased driven by
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in CIB
prime brokerage.

Deposits increased reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs
primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
related effect of certain government actions;
• in the wholesale businesses, while the inflows principally occurred
in March as clients sought to remain liquid as a result of market
conditions, balances continued to increase through the end of
2020, and

• in CCB, the increase was driven by lower spending and higher

cash balances across both consumer and small business
customers, as well as growth from existing and new accounts.
Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 102–
108; and Notes 2 and 17 for more information.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements increased reflecting:
• higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury

and CIO, as well as trading assets in CIB,

partially offset by
• a decline in client-driven market-making activities in CIB, including
the Firm's non-participation in the Federal Reserve's open market
operations. Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on
pages 102–108 and Note 11 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased reflecting higher financing of CIB
prime brokerage activities. Refer to pages 102–108 for information
on changes in Liquidity Risk Management.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles was flat as the increase
in goodwill related to the acquisitions of cxLoyalty and 55ip was
offset by lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment speeds on
lower rates, and the realization of expected cash flows, partially
offset by net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for additional
information.

Other assets increased reflecting higher cash collateral placed
with central counterparties in CIB.

Trading liabilities increased reflecting client-driven market-making
activities, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt
and equity instruments and higher derivative payables as a result of
market movements in CIB Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for
additional information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting higher
client payables related to client-driven activities in CIB Markets.
Refer to Note 19 for additional information.
Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on pages 60-61 and Note
14 and 28 for information on Beneficial interests issued by
consolidated VIEs.
Long-term debt decreased as a result of maturities of FHLB
advances; net maturities of senior debt, which included the early
termination of certain of the Firm's debt; partially offset by an
issuance of subordinated debt, and higher fair value hedge
accounting adjustments related to lower interest rates. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 for
additional information.
Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting the combined impact of
net income, capital actions, the adoption of CECL and an increase
in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The
increase in AOCI was driven by net unrealized gains on AFS
securities, and higher valuation of interest rate cash flow hedges.
Refer to page 165 for information on changes in stockholders’
equity, and Capital actions on page 99, Note 24 for additional
information on AOCI.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected
lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-
period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Operating activities
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These
assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of
business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are
affected by client-driven and risk management activities and
market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from
operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its
capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured
sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading assets,

other assets, and securities borrowed, partially offset by higher
trading liabilities and net income excluding noncash
adjustments.

• In 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding
noncash adjustments, lower trading assets, and net proceeds of
sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale,
partially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase in
other assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.

Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating
held-for-investment loans and investing in the investment
securities portfolio, and other short-term instruments.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of

investment securities, higher net originations of loans, and
higher securities purchased under resale agreements.

• In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment

securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under
resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and
securitizations of loans held-for-investment.

Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits
and issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred stock.

• In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an
increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term
borrowings.

• In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, partially offset
by a decrease in short-term borrowings and net payments of
long-term borrowings.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common

stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. On
March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal
Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to
discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-
balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may
require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized
on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-balance sheet
under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S.
GAAP”).

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements,
including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related
financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related
transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support
any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with
SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.
Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is
permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where
such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct.

The table below provides an index of where in this 2020 Form 10-K discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be
found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

Management’s discussion and analysis

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on
pages 162-166. That presentation, which is referred to as
“reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the
Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year
and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S.
GAAP financial statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis,
management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead
ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis
results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews
the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition
of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total
net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business
segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is
presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to
taxable investments and securities. These financial measures
allow

management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-
year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is
recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no
impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the
LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at
the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-
GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about
the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or
of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and,
therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business
segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to
Business Segment Results on pages 65–84 for additional
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial
measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly
named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a
managed basis, management also reviews these metrics
excluding CIB Markets, as shown below; these metrics, which
exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of
the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management)
and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics that exclude
CIB Markets are referred to as non-markets-related net interest
income and net yield. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure
of non-markets-related net interest income and net yield provides
investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze
the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides
a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising
activities.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
Pre-provision profit
Total net revenue – Total noninterest expense
Return on assets (“ROA”)
Reported net income / Total average assets
Return on common equity (“ROE”)
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
Tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”)
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP financial measures
which include:

Management’s discussion and analysis

Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS
Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common
stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs),
net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE.
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the
Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &
Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products
and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they
reflect the manner in which financial information is currently
evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results
are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,
on pages 62–64 for a definition of managed basis.

Business segment changes
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred certain assets,
liabilities, revenue, expense and headcount associated with certain
wealth management clients from AWM to the J.P. Morgan Wealth
Management business unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have
been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the
transfer of approximately 1,650 technology and support staff during
the second and third quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and
certain high-net-worth client relationships remained in AWM.
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale
Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the
Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments
business comprises:
• Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
• Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was

previously reported in Lending in CIB.

In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets,
liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services
business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and
expenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across
CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. In the
fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with
the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s
Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Payment
processing-only clients are those that only use payment services
offered by Merchant Services, and in general do not currently utilize
other services offered by the Firm. Prior-period amounts have been
revised

to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present each
segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management
reporting process that derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment
reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future
periods.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to
share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing
agreements.

Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by corporate
support units, or another business segment, the costs of those
services are allocated to the respective business segments. The
expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of
services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related
to corporate support units, technology and operations not currently
utilized by any LOB, are not

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

65

 
Management’s discussion and analysis

allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate.
Expense retained in Corporate generally includes parent company
costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone
businesses; and other items not aligned with a particular business
segment.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm allocates
interest income and expense to each business segment and
transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to
Treasury and CIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing
process considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory
requirements on a product-by-product basis within each business
segment.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of
the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term
debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable
business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in
Corporate. The methodology to allocate the

cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to
the business segments is aligned with the Firm’s process to allocate
capital. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in
a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is
reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business
segment’s net income applicable to common equity.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as
equity. As of January 1, 2021, the Firm has changed its line of
business capital allocations primarily as a result of changes in
exposures for each LOB and an increase in the relative risk
weighting toward Standardized RWA. The assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed
and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from
time to time. 

Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 for additional information
on business segment capital allocation.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2020 compared with 2019
Net income was $8.2 billion, a decrease of 50%, largely driven by
an increase in the provision for credit losses.

Noninterest expense was $28.0 billion, relatively flat, reflecting:

• lower marketing expense as a result of lower investments in
marketing campaigns and lower travel-related benefits, and

Net revenue was $51.3 billion, a decrease of 7%.

• lower structural expenses,

Net interest income was $33.5 billion, down 10%, driven by:

offset by

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, spread

• investments in the business, higher volume-related

compensation, and higher depreciation on auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $12.3 billion, an increase of
$7.4 billion from the prior year, driven by:

• additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of: $6.6 billion for
Card, $649 million for CBB, and $560 million for Auto,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs

and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment
assistance and government stimulus.

The prior year included a $300 million net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 110–
134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 132-133 for further
discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit
losses.

compression and lower loans in Home Lending, predominantly
due to paydowns and prior year loan sales, and lower loans in
Card due to the decline in sales volume as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic,

partially offset by

• growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion in Card,
the prior year included charges for the unwind of the internal
funding from Treasury and CIO associated with the sales of
certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue was $17.7 billion, flat, reflecting:

• lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction activity and
the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic,

• lower card income due to lower net interchange income
reflecting lower credit card sales volumes and debit card
transactions as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, largely offset by lower acquisition costs and higher
annual fees, and

• lower asset management, administration and commissions due
to a lower volume of annuity sales offset by a higher level of
investment assets,

offset by

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher
mortgage production volumes and margins; the prior year
included gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the
value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees
and related income.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The
adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are
considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Note
1 for further information.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned certain wealth management clients
from AWM to CCB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

(a) At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.6 billion of PCD loans.

Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the
Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools
was performing.

(b) At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage
loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of
$558 million, $963 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. These amounts have
been excluded based upon the government guarantee. Prior-period amounts of
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government
agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans have been revised to conform with
the current presentation; refer to footnote (c) for additional information.
(c) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option

elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) At December 31, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. The
rates prior to January 1, 2020 were revised to include the impact of PCI loans.

(e) At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, excluded mortgage loans insured by

U.S. government agencies of $744 million, $1.7 billion and $4.1 billion,
respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee. Prior-period amounts of
mortgage loans 30 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government
agencies excluded from 30+ day delinquency rate have been revised to
conform with the current presentation; refer to footnote (c) for additional
information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

(f) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response

to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-
116 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and
are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were also at least 150
days past due and therefore considered collateral-dependent. Collateral-
dependent loans are charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value
of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(g) At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking
under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm
does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit
Portfolio on pages 112-113 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(h) At December 31, 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card

and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-
19 pandemic were $9.1 billion, $264 million and $376 million, respectively.
Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not
considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-116
for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $33.7 billion, up 34%.
Markets revenue was $29.5 billion, up 41%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $20.9 billion, up 45%, driven

by strong client activity across products primarily in Rates,
Credit, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Securitized
Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $8.6 billion, up 33%, driven by

strong client activity across products.

• Securities Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2%, driven by

deposit balance and fee growth largely offset by deposit margin
compression.

The provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion, compared with
$277 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net
additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industries.

Noninterest expense was $23.5 billion, up 5%, driven by higher
volume- and revenue-related expense and legal expense.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2020 compared with 2019
Net income was $17.1 billion, up 43%.

Net revenue was $49.3 billion, up 26%.

Banking revenue was $15.6 billion, up 11%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $8.9 billion, up 23%, driven by
higher Investment Banking fees, up 25%, reflecting higher equity
and debt underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking
for Global Investment Banking fees with overall share gains,
according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, up 66%,

predominantly in follow-on offerings and convertible securities
markets due to increased industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $4.4 billion, up 23%, driven by

increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in
investment grade and high yield bonds. The increased activity
resulted in part from clients seeking liquidity in the first half of
the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

– Advisory fees of $2.4 billion were flat, reflecting an increase in

wallet share, despite a decrease in industry-wide fees.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $5.6 billion, down 5%, driven
by deposit margin compression and a reporting reclassification
for certain expenses which are now reported as a reduction of
revenue in Merchant Services, largely offset by higher deposit
balances.

• Lending revenue was $1.1 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven
by higher net interest income reflecting higher yields on new
loans and higher loan balances, as well as higher loan
commitment fees, largely offset by fair value losses on hedges of
accrual loans.

between the price at which a market participant is willing and able
to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another
market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and
vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are
interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-
related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic
conditions. 

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement data for
the Markets businesses. Markets consists of Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across
revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are
recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7
for a description of the composition of these income statement line
items.

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments
and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-
making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts
recognized upon executing new transactions with market
participants, as well as “inventory-related revenue”, which
is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and
other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of,
or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of
instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue
recognized upon executing new transactions with market
participants is driven by many factors including the level of client
activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference

(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss
days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the
Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a
particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 137–139.

2020 compared with 2019
Net income was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 35%, driven by an
increase in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $9.3 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Net
interest income was $6.2 billion, a decrease of 5%, driven by
deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher
deposit balances and lending revenue. Noninterest revenue was
$3.1 billion, an increase of 13%, driven by higher deposit-related
fees, particularly cash management fees, higher investment
banking revenue, and a gain on a strategic investment. The
increase was partially offset by a $56 million markdown of a held-
for-sale position and lower card income, primarily due to lower
volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of 2%, driven by
higher compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion, compared to $296
million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net additions
to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industries.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from
CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. In conjunction with
this realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale
payments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with
the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale
Payments business from CCB and CB. Prior-period revenue and expense amounts
have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset

management, administration and commissions (which are included in all other
income) to lending and deposit-related fees. Prior period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current period presentation.

(b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax credits
related to equity investments in designated community development entities
and in entities established for rehabilitation of historic properties, as well as tax-
exempt income related to municipal financing activities of $351 million, $460
million and $444 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and
2018, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CB product revenue consists of the following:
Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are
primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral includes
receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.
Products include term loans, revolving lines of credit, bridge
financing, asset-based structures, leases, and standby letters of
credit.
Wholesale payments includes revenue from a broad range of
products and services that enable CB clients to manage payments
and receipts, as well as invest and manage funds.
Investment banking includes revenue from a range of products
providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-raising alternatives,
as well as balance sheet and risk management tools through
advisory, equity underwriting, and loan syndications. Revenue from
Fixed Income and Equity Markets products used by CB clients is
also included.
Other product revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent
adjustments generated from Community Development Banking
activities and certain income derived from principal transactions.

2020 compared with 2019
Net income was $3.0 billion, an increase of 4%.

Net revenue was $14.2 billion, an increase of 5%. Net interest
income was $3.4 billion, up 2%, driven by higher deposit and loan
balances as well as loan margin expansion, offset by deposit
margin compression. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up
6%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees as a
result of net inflows into liquidity and long term products, higher
performance fees and increased brokerage commissions on
higher client-driven volume, partially offset by lower net investment
valuation gains.

Revenue from Asset Management was $7.7 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by higher asset management fees as a result
of net inflows into liquidity products as well as higher performance
fees, partially offset by lower net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $6.6 billion, up 4%,
predominantly driven by higher deposit and loan balances,
increased brokerage commissions and asset management fees,
largely offset by deposit margin compression.

The provision for credit losses was $263 million, driven by
additions to the allowance for credit losses, predominantly as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Noninterest expense was $10.0 billion, an increase of 2%, driven
by legal expense, volume- and revenue-related expense as well
as investments in the business, partially offset by lower structural
expense.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned certain wealth management clients
from AWM to CCB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation, including a decrease to net revenue of $725 million and $649
million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Effective in
the first quarter of 2021, the Wealth Management business was renamed Global
Private Bank.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

AWM’s client segments consist of the following:
Private Banking clients include high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals,
families, money managers and business owners.

Institutional clients include both corporate and public institutions, endowments,
foundations, nonprofit organizations and governments worldwide.
Retail clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or

5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted
performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the
worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The
“overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are
given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of
history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are
sourced from these fund rating providers mentioned in footnote (a). The data
providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is
based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except
for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share
class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as
being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail
version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment,
currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if
all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in
the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile rankings, the
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are
sourced from the fund ranking providers mentioned in footnote (b). Quartile
rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data
providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class
level for U.S. domiciled funds and at the “primary share class” level or fund
level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar,
denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio
and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual
management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where
peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class”
territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness. The
performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have
been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

2020 compared with 2019
Net income was a loss of $1.8 billion compared with income of
$1.1 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, compared with revenue of
$1.2 billion in the prior year, driven by lower net interest income
partially offset by higher noninterest revenue. The decrease in net
interest income was predominantly driven by lower rates, including
the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities,
as well as limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to
significant deposit growth across the LOBs.

Noninterest revenue increased reflecting higher net valuations on
certain legacy equity investments and higher net investment
securities gains due to the repositioning of the investment
securities portfolio.

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion was up $305 million driven by
an impairment on a legacy investment.

The provision for credit losses relates to the HTM portfolio, which
became subject to the CECL accounting guidance beginning on
January 1, 2020.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly driven by
a lower level of pre-tax income and changes in the level and mix of
income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and local
taxes. The prior period included $1.1 billion of tax benefits related
to the resolution of certain tax audits.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from

municipal bonds, of $241 million, $314 million and $382 million for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Treasury and CIO overview
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring,
monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding,
capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The
risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities
undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments
to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and
off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability
management objectives generally by investing in high-quality
securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also use
derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-liability management
objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In
addition, Treasury and CIO manage the Firm’s cash position
primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in
short-term instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 102–108 for further information on liquidity and funding risk.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–142 for
information on interest rate, foreign exchange and other risks.

The investment securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. GSE
and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed
securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, obligations of
U.S. states and municipalities, other ABS and corporate debt
securities. At December 31, 2020, the investment securities
portfolio was $587.9 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external
ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further information
on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities.
When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises
customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes
markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm
takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to
manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that
balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and
investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among
other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and independent
oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s
performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework
involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts

of risks. 

Drivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of
risks include the economic environment, regulatory and
government policy, competitor and market evolution, business
decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,
dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.

Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves.
Risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:

• Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or

reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business
plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating
environment.

• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default
or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer;
or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments, including

consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment
portfolio risk.

• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in
market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates,
equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied
volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the
short and long term.

• Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome

resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems; human factors; or external events impacting the
Firm’s processes or systems. It includes compliance, conduct,
legal, and estimations and model risk.

Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and
qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks
manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in
earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or
qualitative impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and
customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is managed
on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk
Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the Risk
Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk
Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s
Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM organization and
manage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The framework
is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee in the form of
the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO
oversees and delegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk
Executives (“FREs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”), who each establish Risk Management and Compliance
organizations, set the Firm’s risk governance policies and
standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the
Firm’s risk governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks
that arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span
across the individual LOBs, functions and regions.

Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each of its LOBs and Corporate areas giving
rise to risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM
function, and within its own management-identified risk and control
standards. Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned
Operations, Technology and Control Management, are the Firm’s
“first line of defense” and own the identification of risks, as well as
the design and execution of controls to manage those risks. The
first line of defense is responsible for adherence to applicable
laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation of the risk
management structure (which may include policy, standards,
limits, thresholds and controls) established by IRM.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

85

Management’s discussion and analysis

The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is the
Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function independently
assesses and challenges the first line of defense risk management
practices. IRM is also responsible for its own adherence to
applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation
of policies and standards established by IRM with respect to its
own processes.

Internal Audit is an independent function that provides objective
assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide
processes, controls, governance and risk management as the
“third line of defense.” The Internal Audit Function is headed by
the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and
administratively to the CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a
particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources
and Legal.

Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate area owns the ongoing identification of
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls, inclusive of
IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this
activity, the Firm has a formal Risk Identification framework
designed to facilitate their responsibility to identify material risks
inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository and
review the most material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function
reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks,
maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated
Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and
Board Risk Committee.

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a “Risk Appetite”
framework. The framework and the Firm’s risk appetite are set and
approved by the Firm’s CEO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and
CRO. Quantitative parameters and qualitative factors are used to
monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent
with its stated risk appetite. Qualitative factors have been
established to assess select operational risks, and impact to the
Firm’s reputation. Risk Appetite results are reported to the Board
Risk Committee.

86

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to senior
management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk
governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the oversight of risk which are not
shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s
CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other
senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the
Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible
for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate
the Board’s exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors provides oversight of risk. The
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees
risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control
environment, and the Compensation & Management Development
Committee oversees compensation and other management-
related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees
reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of
responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible
for the oversight of management of the bank. The JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this function acting directly
and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board
of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan
Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Risk
Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with
respect to

compensation and other management-related matters, the
Compensation & Management Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to implement a global risk
management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess
and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s
responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies
and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and
reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite
and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact
on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other
significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk
Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective
system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s
assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial
statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical
standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and
regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s
independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications,
independence and performance, and of the performance of the
Firm’s Internal Audit function.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The Compensation & Management Development Committee
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews and
approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified benefits
programs. The Committee reviews the performance of Operating
Committee members against their goals, and approves their
compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s award is subject to
ratification by the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC
also reviews the development of and succession for key
executives, and provides oversight of the Firm’s culture, including
reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct
issues and any related employee actions, including compensation
actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee assists the Board in its
oversight of the Firm's positions and practices on public
responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending,
sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues
that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the
Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also
provides guidance on these matters to management and the
Board, as appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises
general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of
Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the
Board of Directors proposed nominees for election to the Board.
The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board
corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also
appraises the framework for assessing the Board’s performance
and self-evaluation.

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily
responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest
management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of the risks
inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an escalation
point for risk topics and issues raised by underlying committees
and/or FRC members.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation
committee for senior management to review and discuss the
Firmwide operational risk environment including identified issues,
operational risk metrics and significant events that have been
escalated.

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible
for providing oversight of the governance, limits, and controls that
are in place through the scope of their activities. These
committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the
business operating in a particular region could be exposed to
adverse outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting,
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these
committees.

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees
oversee the operational risk and control environment of their
respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk,
Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are
responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks
and other data that may impact the level of operating risk in a
business or function, addressing key operational risk issues,
focusing on processes with control concerns and overseeing
control remediation.

The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management (“ALM”)
activities and the management of liquidity risk, balance sheet,
interest rate risk, and capital risk.

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is composed
of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for
overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation
activities conducted across the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation
associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or
inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each LOB
and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s most
significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen by IRM
through participation in relevant business reviews, LOB and
Corporate senior management meetings, risk and control
committees and other relevant governance forums and ongoing
discussions. The Board of Directors oversees management’s
strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM
and the Firm’s risk management framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify the
associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk
Identification process and monitored and assessed as part of the
Firmwide Risk Appetite framework.

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and
Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk
profile of the Firm.

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the
development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by the
Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”), the
Operating Committee and senior management teams in each LOB
and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically.
The process includes evaluating the high-level strategic framework
and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the
operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing
new strategies.

These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are
incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the Board for
review. 

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-adjusted
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in
the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk
Management on pages 91-101 for further information on capital
risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 for
further information on liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk
Management on page 109 for further information on reputation
risk.

90

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and
associated risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance
sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a
strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and
Operating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet
philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and
robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy
focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to
build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly
stressed environments. Senior management considers the
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making any significant
decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to
considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management
evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring
the Firm’s capital strength.

• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its

subsidiaries;

• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital
ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm
and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all
times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;

• Meet capital distribution objectives; and

• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a
resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred
resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through establishing internal
minimum capital requirements and a strong capital governance
framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment
of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress
events, when setting its minimum capital levels.

Capital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a
range of potential events.

Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function whose
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk
across the Firm.

The current capital governance framework requires regular
monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and follows prescribed
escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity
levels.

Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and

indicators, including capital risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit

breaches; and

• Performing an independent assessment of the Firm’s capital

management activities, including changes made to the
Contingency Capital Plan described below.

In addition, the Basel Independent Review function (“BIR”), which
is a part of the IRM function, conducts independent assessments
of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework. These assessments are
intended to ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory
capital rules in support of senior management’s responsibility for
managing capital and for the Board Risk Committee’s oversight of
management in executing that responsibility.

Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management are to:

• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and
invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in
stressed environments;

• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment

opportunities;

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital
management include the Capital Governance Committee, the
Treasurer Committee and the Firmwide ALCO. Oversight of capital
management is governed through the CIO, Treasury and
Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk
Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance.
Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 85-89 for additional
discussion on the Board Risk Committee and the ALCO.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including the Firm, to
submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and
approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses
CCAR and other stress testing processes to ensure that large
BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and
financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital
assessment and planning processes in place that address each
BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain
stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates
each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy
assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make
capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock
repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely
adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine
each firm’s SCB requirement for the coming

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Management’s discussion and analysis

year. Refer to Key Regulatory Developments on pages 93–94 for
additional information.

On June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that it had completed the
2020 CCAR stress test process. On August 10, 2020, the Federal
Reserve affirmed the Firm's SCB requirement of 3.3% and the
Firm's minimum Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.3% (up
from 10.5%). The SCB requirement became effective on October
1, 2020.

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve determined that changes in
financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook due to the
COVID-19 pandemic could have a material effect on a firm’s risk
profile and financial condition and therefore required all large bank
holding companies, including the Firm, to update and resubmit
their capital plans by November 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020,
the Federal Reserve released its results from the 2020 CCAR
Round 2 stress test, which showed that large banks had strong
levels of capital and announced that it would allow all large banks,
including the Firm, to resume share repurchases commencing in
the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions for at least
the first quarter of 2021 given considerable economic uncertainty
remained. The Federal Reserve has stated that due to uncertainty
about future economic conditions and the ultimate path of the
current recovery, the SCB will not be reset at this time. The
Federal Reserve will notify firms by March 31, 2021 whether a
revised SCB requirement based on the 2020 CCAR Round 2
stress test will be recalculated ahead of the 2021 annual CCAR
assessment.

Refer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on actions
taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 2020 CCAR
results.

Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of
Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for
managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance
with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital
adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols
with capital planning.

The CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the potential
impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the
Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the
parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are
articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key
drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate
short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational
risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key
vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However,
when defining a broad range of scenarios, actual events can be
worse. Accordingly, management considers additional stresses
outside these scenarios, as necessary. These results are reviewed
by management and the Board of Directors.

Contingency capital plan
The Firm’s contingency capital plan establishes the capital
management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles
underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in
normal economic conditions and during stress. The contingency
capital plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital
levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the
ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken
or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period
of stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including
well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding
company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital
requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries,
including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital
requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel
Committee, as amended from time to time.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios
and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and
its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs
and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach
(“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios,
the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their
respective minimum capital ratios.

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk
RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced,
operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit
risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches
are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-
sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal
credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market
risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the
RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may
supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment
and feedback from its regulators.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach
banking organizations, including the Firm, to

calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional
information.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-capitalized. However, the
continuation or further deterioration of the current macroeconomic
environment could result in impacts to the Firm’s capital and
leverage.

Key Regulatory Developments

Current Expected Credit Losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the
Firm adopted the Financial Instruments – Credit Losses guidance
under U.S. GAAP. As permitted under the U.S. capital rules issued
by the federal banking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected
to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to
retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year
in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26,
2020) that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition
period (“CECL capital transition provisions”).

The final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the
effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model
during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2”
transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1
capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses
(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2
transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized
in CET1 capital, as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be
phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,
2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the year ended December 31,
2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $5.7 billion, which is
the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the
$12.2 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding
allowances on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also
been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and
total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 1 for further information on
the CECL accounting guidance.

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ("MMLF"). The
Federal Reserve established the MMLF facility on March 18, 2020,
authorized through at least March 31, 2021, to enhance the
liquidity and functioning of money markets. Under the MMLF, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (“FRBB”) makes nonrecourse
advances to participating financial institutions to purchase certain
types of assets from eligible money market mutual fund clients.
These assets, which are reflected in other assets on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB as
collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies
issued an interim final rule (issued as final on

September 29, 2020) to neutralize the effects of purchasing assets
through the program on risk-based and leverage-based capital
ratios. As of December 31, 2020, the Firm excluded assets
purchased from money market mutual fund clients pursuant to
nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF in the amount of
$187 million from its RWA and $358 million from adjusted three
month average assets and total leverage exposure.

Supplementary leverage ratio temporary revision. On April 1,
2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that
requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage
exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding
companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These
exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect
through March 31, 2021.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an
interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to
apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of
December 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not elected
to apply this exclusion.

Paycheck Protection Program. On April 13, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on
September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a
zero percent risk weight to loans originated under the program.
Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does
not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. As of
December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately $27 billion of
loans under the program.

The rule also provides that if a PPP loan is pledged as collateral
for a non-recourse loan under the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck
Protection Program Lending (“PPPL”) Facility, the PPP loan can
be excluded from leverage-based capital ratios. As of December
31, 2020, the Firm had not participated in the PPPL Facility.

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic on pages 52-53 for additional information on regulatory
actions and significant financing programs that the U.S.
government and regulators have introduced to address the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stress Capital Buffer. On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve
issued the final rule introducing the SCB framework for the Basel
III Standardized approach that is designed to more closely
integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in the annual
CCAR with the ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs
under the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the fixed
2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer in the Standardized
approach with a dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final rule
does not apply to the U.S. Basel III Advanced approach capital
requirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be effective on
October 1 of each year and is expected to remain in effect until
September 30 of the following year.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued a final rule prescribing the regulatory capital
treatment for holdings of TLAC debt instruments by certain large
banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing capital
deductions rule around the

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums

holdings of capital instruments of financial institutions to also
include TLAC debt instruments issued by systemically important
banking organizations. The final rule will become effective on April
1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Firm’s risk-based capital metrics.

The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III minimum CET1 capital ratio under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum
CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to
hold additional levels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation
buffer”. The capital conservation buffer incorporates a global
systemically important bank (“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary
countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation
buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a
variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized
regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to
assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two
separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous
fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. The first
(“Method 1”), reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the
Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated
across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. The second
(“Method 2”), modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a
measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of
substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also
required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer.

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the
Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is
calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet
assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital,
and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn
commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory
minimum will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the
Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share
repurchases.

Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III,
the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum
capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under
the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt
Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement
Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional
information.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well
as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm
is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the
Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III
measures.

The Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge
calculated under Method 2 remains unchanged at 3.5% for 2021.
On November 11, 2020, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”)
released its annual GSIB list, which published the Firm’s Method 1
GSIB surcharge of 2.0% (down from 2.5%) effective January 1,
2021, based upon data as of December 31, 2019.

The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as
of December 31, 2020 is 4.0%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB
rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective regulatory minimum
GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.0% on January 1,
2023 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB surcharge calculation
based upon data as of December 31, 2021 is lower.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework
for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into
account the macro financial environment in which large,
internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2020,
the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The
Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least
annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve,
FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully
above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of
RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the
risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital
conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any
countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of
capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and
common share repurchases, as well as certain executive
discretionary bonus payments.

The Firm has a target Basel III CET1 capital ratio of 12%.
However, the Firm may remain above that level in order to satisfy
leverage-based capital requirements if deposits continue to grow
due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier
holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels
of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer
to TLAC on page 100 for additional information.

consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected
returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s
performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge,
and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. As of
January 1, 2021, the Firm has changed its line of business capital
allocations primarily as a result of changes in exposures for each
LOB and an increase in the relative risk weighting toward
Standardized RWA. The assumptions and methodologies used to
allocate capital are periodically assessed and as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change from time to time. 
The following table presents the capital allocated to each business
segment.

Common stock
On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily
suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the
Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to
discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large
banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases
commencing in the first quarter of 2021. As directed by the Federal
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends in the
first quarter of 2021 are restricted and cannot exceed the average
of the Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.
The Firm's Board of Directors has authorized a new common
share repurchase program for up to $30 billion.

The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common
stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

The authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at
management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the
exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is
subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and
regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account
goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and
alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program
does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be
suspended by management at any time; and may be executed
through open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written
trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under
Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which
allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods
when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for
example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Management’s discussion and analysis

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its
contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or
that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and
tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Oversight function whose primary
objective is to provide oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm.
Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;

• Establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including

liquidity risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit

breaches;

• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management

processes;

• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity

liquidity stress tests as well as regulatory defined liquidity stress
tests;

• Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity

stress assumptions; and

• Monitoring liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and

funding activities;

Liquidity management
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management are to:

• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal

entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet
contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal
economic cycles as well as during stress events, and

• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-specific

liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding
plans;

• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk

appetite tolerances and limits;

• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to

funding and liquidity risk; and

• Setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying liquidity

characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as
certain off-balance sheet items.

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the
Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition,
the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board
of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances,
liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk
Management on pages 85-89 for further discussion of ALCO and
other risk-related committees.

Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has
sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including
scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery
planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal entities on a
regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to
specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume
all of the Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take
into consideration:

• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity

• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding

sources.

markets,

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the
Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global
approach in order to:

• Optimize liquidity sources and uses;

• Monitor exposures;

•

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the
Firm’s legal entities; and

• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a

Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.

In the context of the Firm’s liquidity management, Treasury and
CIO is responsible for:

• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the
assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking
into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;

• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;

• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows, and

• Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of
liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such
as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.

Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market
and idiosyncratic stresses.

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the
Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The
Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through
equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding
company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides
funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company
and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent
Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to
comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity
requirements, and to manage through periods of

102

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource needs
during a liquidity stress event and incorporates liquidity risk limits,
indicators and risk appetite tolerances that make up Liquidity
Escalation Points. The CFP also identifies the alternative
contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm
and its legal entities in a period of stress.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet
its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30
calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for
purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered
HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in
the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-
quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone
100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to
non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA.

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress
outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are
applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and
obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that

The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months
ended December 31, 2020, compared with the three-month period
ended September 30, 2020, predominantly driven by a decrease
in cash from long-term debt maturities, including the early
termination of certain of the Firm's debt at the end of the third
quarter 2020.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months
ended December 31, 2020, compared with the prior year period
primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from the
significant increase in deposits as well as elevated market
activities in the CIB.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during the
three months ended December 31, 2020, compared with both the
three month periods ended September 30, 2020 and December
31, 2019 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued to
increase in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the COVID-19
pandemic and the related effect of certain government actions.
The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to
changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a
result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a
further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as
equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part
of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that
are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these
securities was approximately $740 billion and $315 billion as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing
market conditions. The fair value increased compared to
December 31, 2019, due to an increase in excess eligible HQLA at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of
increased deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the
discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately
$307 billion and $322 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash
and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal
Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Available
borrowing capacity decreased from December 31, 2019 primarily
due to lower pledged credit card receivable balances driven by the
COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in pledged mortgage
collateral as a result of paydown and maturity activity. Although
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the
Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central
banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for
large banking organizations that is intended to measure the
adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable funding
over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking
organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an
NSFR of at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule
will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required
to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually
beginning in 2023.

As of December 31, 2020 the Firm estimates that it was compliant
with the 100% minimum NSFR based on its current understanding
of the final rule.

104

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet
obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of
funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding
in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the
primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access
funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through
the issuance of

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent
Company or the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are
primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury
and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned certain wealth management clients from AWM to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management business unit within CCB. In the first
quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s
reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of
the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale
operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable
sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service relationships with the
Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-
to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities,

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally
more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit
balances, over time. However, during periods of market disruption
those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the year ended December 31,
2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily
driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related
effect of certain government actions. In the wholesale businesses,
while the inflows principally occurred in March as clients sought to
remain liquid as a result of market conditions, balances continued
to increase through the end of 2020. In CCB, the increase was
driven by lower spending and higher cash balances across both
consumer and small business customers, as well as growth from
existing and new accounts.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results
and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 65–84
and pages 57-58, respectively, for further information on deposit

information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist
of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.
These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality
securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2020,
compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting higher secured
financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO, as well
as trading assets in CIB, partially offset by a decline in client-driven
market-making activities in CIB, including the Firm's non-
participation in the Federal Reserve's open market operations.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment
and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing,
the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities,
including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other
market and portfolio factors.

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm participated in the MMLF
government facility. The secured nonrecourse advances under the
MMLF are included in other borrowed funds. Refer to Capital Risk
Management on pages 91-101 for additional information on the
MMLF.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility ("PDCF") was established by
the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020. Under the PDCF, the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) provides
collateralized financing on a term basis to primary dealers. These
financing transactions were reported as securities sold under
agreements to repurchase. The Firm participated in the PDCF in
the first quarter of 2020, and ceased its participation in May 2020
as the secured financing market normalized.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist of
other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale commercial
paper. The decrease in short-term unsecured funding at
December 31, 2020, from December 31, 2019 and for the average
year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period,
was due to lower net commercial paper issuance primarily for
short-term liquidity management.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven
primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives
include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets,
tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both
bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the
IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on long-term debt.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit
ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect
on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of
funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to
lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of
ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and
behavioral factors,

which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and
stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient
liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due
to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other
third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in
credit ratings.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:

(a) On April 18, 2020, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries but revised the outlook on the credit

ratings from stable to negative given expectations that credit fundamentals will deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or
changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any
limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral,
based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings,
financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable
and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios,
strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse
funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic
and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future
profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as
well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.

Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles
for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of
employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation
of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage
in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction,
initiate a business process or other matters. Sustainability, social
responsibility and environmental impacts are important
considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a
component of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues deemed material are escalated as
appropriate.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively
impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in
the Firm’s competence by various constituents, including clients,
counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees,
communities or the broader public.

Organization and management
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm. As
reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and
quantify, a reputation risk management function is critical.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the
following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy
and standards consistent with the reputation risk framework

• Managing the governance infrastructure and processes that

support consistent identification, escalation, management and
monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide

•

Providing guidance to LOB Reputation Risk Offices (“RRO”),
as appropriate

The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are wide-
ranging and could be introduced in various ways, including by the
Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties
the Firm does business with. These events could result in financial
losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to
the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or
loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and
investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides
credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses.
In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities
(such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities
financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through
its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit
risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and
procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance
includes the following activities:

• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all

portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval

• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines

• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the

approval of credit exposure

• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans and

• Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-

based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
The Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures,
manages and limits credit risk across the Firm’s businesses. To
measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for
estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.
Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several
factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale),
risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and
borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk
management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk
measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or
counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the
exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses
for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects credit
losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment
loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments
reflects credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related
commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects
the credit losses related to the Firm’s HTM and AFS
securities. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting
Estimates used by the Firm on pages 152-155 for further
information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in
the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential
volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for
loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for
these losses include stress testing that considers alternative
economic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section
below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk
in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses
the potential impact of alternative economic and business
scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic
scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally,
articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across
the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit
migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in
the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing
processes, management also considers additional stresses
outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific
stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to
inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB
level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual
counterparties.

110

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit
Review function is responsible for:

• Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to
exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio, and assessing
the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible
business units; and

• Evaluating the effectiveness of business units’ credit

management processes, including the adequacy of credit
analyses and risk grading/LGD rationales, proper monitoring and
management of credit exposures, and compliance with
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale
loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making,
aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration
levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior
members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting
of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and
geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the
allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at
least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are
provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior
management and the Board of Directors.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed
to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and
decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks
are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly
and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.
The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities,
concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review
parameters and guidelines for management of distressed
exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs
used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other
trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as
certain of these trends can be modified through changes in
underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk
Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against
business expectations, current and forecasted economic
conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted
economic performance and trends are incorporated into the
modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the
monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with
established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised
periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and
counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and
economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss
constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by
the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at
the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its
obligations is decreasing.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is
accomplished through a number of means, including:

• Loan underwriting and credit approval process

• Loan syndications and participations

• Loan sales and securitizations

• Credit derivatives

• Master netting agreements, and

• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for
PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans under CECL. In
conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-
rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer,
excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio
segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining
the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform
with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.
The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the
Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been
considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) because:

•

•

they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications,
whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification
assessments or the IA Statement guidance, or

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs provided by the
CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the
above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. The Firm
considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest
associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its
allowance for credit losses. Refer to Business Developments on
pages 50-51 for more information on customer and client
assistance granted. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further
information on the Firm’s accounting policies on loan modifications
and the allowance for credit losses.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping borrowers
recover and in mitigating the Firm’s credit losses remains
uncertain in light of the unpredictable nature and duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance provided in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers and
clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or
nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
114-120 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 121-131 for
information on loan modifications as of December 31, 2020.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e.,
held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans
accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include
loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as
trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information
regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 28, and 5 for additional
information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and
derivative receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent
in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11
for information regarding credit risk inherent in the securities
financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
114-120 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit
environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit
Portfolio on pages 121-131 and Note 12 for further discussions of

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by the
SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to process and
originate PPP loans. When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are
subject to forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the
forgiveness amount from the SBA. PPP loans have a contractual
term of two or five years and provide borrowers with an automatic
payment deferral of principal and interest. Given that PPP loans
are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize
material credit losses on these loans. PPP processing fees are
deferred and accreted into interest income over the contractual life
of the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or
prepayment. The impact on interest income related to PPP loans
was not material for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Firm was in the early stages of the PPP loan forgiveness
process at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately $27 billion of
loans under the PPP, of which $19 billion are in the consumer
portfolio and $8 billion are in the wholesale portfolio.

insured by U.S. government agencies of $9 million and $41 million,
respectively. Prior-period amount of mortgage loans 90 or more days past due
and insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonperforming assets
has been revised to conform with the current presentation; refer to footnote (a)
for additional information. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by
regulatory guidance.

(g) At December 31, 2020, nonperforming loans included $1.6 billion of PCD loans

on nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded
PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as
each of the pools was performing.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related
commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime
segment of the consumer credit market. Originated mortgage
loans are retained in the residential real estate portfolio,
securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies and U.S.
government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans
are typically retained on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 12 for
further information on the consumer loan portfolio. Refer to Note
28 for further information on lending-related commitments.

In 2020, the allowance for credit losses increased, reflecting the
deterioration in and uncertainty around the future macroeconomic
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased
when compared to December 31, 2019, benefiting from payment
assistance and government stimulus. The potential for increased
infection rates and related lock downs, as well as the duration and
effectiveness of government and other consumer relief measures
remains uncertain which could have a longer term impact on
delinquency rates and net charge-offs.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to

realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 112-113 for a further discussion of the PPP.

revised to conform with the current presentation.
(f) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(g) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not

experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 28 for further information.

(h) Includes billed interest and fees.
(i) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(j) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $874 million and $1.1
billion, respectively. Prior-period amount of mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans has been
revised to conform with the current presentation; refer to footnote (e) for additional information. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.6 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized

interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(l) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19

payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were also at least 150 days past due and therefore considered collateral-
dependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $18.3 billion and $20.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Prior-

period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation; refer to footnote (e) for additional information. These amounts were excluded when calculating
net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form
of payment deferrals.

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm had $10.7 billion of retained
loans under payment deferral programs, which represented a
decrease of approximately $1.5 billion from September 30, 2020
and $17.5 billion from June 30, 2020. During the fourth quarter of
2020, there were approximately $1.4 billion of new enrollments in
payment deferral

programs predominantly in residential real estate and credit card.
Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral programs
are current. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk
associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the
deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are
required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and
considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on
these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

(b) The weighted average LTV ratio of residential real estate loans under payment deferral at December 31, 2020 was 57%.
(c) Excludes risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB and auto operating lease assets that were still under payment deferral programs as of December
31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Auto operating lease asset payment assistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered three
month payment deferral). Deferrals do not extend the term of the lease and all deferred payments are due at the end of the lease term.

(d) Includes $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral as of December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and

June 30, 2020, respectively.

(e) Represents the unpaid principal balance of retained loans which were still under payment deferral programs, divided by the total unpaid principal balance of the respective

loan classes retained loans.

(f) 85% of the balance that exited deferral were current at December 31, 2020.

Of the $10.7 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs
as of December 31, 2020, approximately $4.0 billion were
accounted for as TDRs, either because they were accounted for
as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because they did not qualify
for or the Firm did not elect the option to suspend TDR accounting
guidance provided by the CARES Act and extended by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act. A portion of the remaining $6.7
billion of loans could become TDRs in future periods, depending
on the nature and timing of further modifications or payment
arrangements offered to these borrowers. If the remaining $6.7
billion of loans were considered TDRs, the Firm estimates that it
would result in an increase in standardized RWA of as much as
$2.5 billion.

Predominantly all borrowers, including those accounted for as
TDRs, were current upon enrollment in payment deferral programs
and are expected to exit payment deferral programs in a current
status, either because no payments are contractually due during
the deferral period or because payments originally contractually
due during the deferral period will be due at maturity upon exit. For
those borrowers that are unable to resume making payments in
accordance with the original or modified contractual terms of their
agreements upon exit from deferral programs, they will be placed
on nonaccrual status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy,
except for credit cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and
charged off or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off
policies. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s
nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-value
ratio of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2020, $146.6 billion, or 65% of the total retained
residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans
insured by U.S. government agencies, were concentrated in
California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, compared with
$157.9 billion, or 65%, at December 31, 2019.

Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have
declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices,
customer pay-downs, and charge-offs or liquidations of higher LTV
loans.

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition
and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate
loans.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances were flat from December 31, 2019 as PPP loan
originations in Business Banking were offset by lower residential
real estate loans, reflecting paydowns.

The following discussions provide information concerning
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information
about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan
modifications and other credit quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio,
including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.
The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 driven by
paydowns largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans
that have been retained on the balance sheet. The 30+
delinquency rate decreased to 0.98% at December 31, 2020, from
1.35% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to payment assistance
and government stimulus. Nonaccrual loans increased from
December 31, 2019 due primarily to loans placed on nonaccrual
status related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as
the adoption of CECL, as PCD loans became subject to
nonaccrual treatment. Net recoveries for the year ended
December 31, 2020 were higher when compared with the prior
year as the current year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. This amount included $8.6
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully
amortizing payments or have been modified and $7.7 billion of
interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030.
The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of interest-
only residential mortgage loans were $25.6 billion and $22.5
billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment
period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated
as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. The net charge-off rate for the year ended
December 31, 2020 was consistent with the rate of the broader
residential mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is
generally in line with the performance of the broader residential
mortgage portfolio.

include both TDRs and modified loans accounted for as PCI loans
prior to the adoption of CECL. The following table does not include
loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are
not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs, or loans

the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing
Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural
Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not
included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to
modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold
back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become
subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about sales of
loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.

(b) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans included $3.0 billion and
$1.9 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90
days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loans modified
in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

(c) At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.3 billion of PCD loans.

Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the
Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools
was performing.

(d) Amount represents the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans at

December 31, 2019, which were moved to retained loans upon the adoption of
CECL.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio predominantly
consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,
as well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared with
December 31, 2019, predominantly due to PPP loan originations
of $21.9 billion in Business Banking of which $19.2 billion
remained outstanding at December 31, 2020 as well as from
growth in the auto portfolio from loan originations, partially offset
by paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans.
The 30+ delinquency rate decreased to 0.60% at December 31,
2020, from 1.31% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to
payment assistance and government stimulus, as well as PPP
loan originations as these loans are all considered current. The
scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.25% and 0.44%

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2019
reflecting a decline in sales volume that began in March as a result
of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The December 31, 2020
30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%,
respectively, decreased compared to the December 31, 2019 30+
and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 0.95%, respectively.
The delinquency rates were positively impacted by borrowers who
received payment assistance and government stimulus. Net
charge-offs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared with the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs and
higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment assistance
and government stimulus.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically
remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible
portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2020, $65.0 billion, or 45% of the total retained
credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas,
New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $77.5 billion, or 46%,
at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional information
on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card
loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2020, the Firm had $1.4 billion of credit card
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does
not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional
information about loan modification programs for borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well
as through various operating services (such as cash management
and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash
placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by
the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the
balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated
loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit
risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by
conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and
of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 123-127 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in
CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business
banking and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance
for credit losses.

In 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad-
based credit deterioration and an increase in the allowance for
credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, the investment-grade
percentage of the portfolio decreased from 74% to 71%, and
criticized exposure increased $26.5 billion from $15.1 billion to
$41.6 billion. The increase in criticized exposure was largely driven
by downgrades in Consumer & Retail, Oil & Gas and Real Estate,
and to a lesser extent, net portfolio activity in Technology, Media &
Telecommunications. The continuation or worsening of the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment
could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including
investment-grade percentages, as well as to criticized and
nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.

As of December 31, 2020 retained loans were up $33.3 billion
predominantly driven by AWM and CIB, and lending-related
commitments were up $32.4 billion, predominantly driven by CIB
and CB.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Wholesale assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of
payment deferrals and covenant modifications.

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately $1.6 billion
of retained loans still under payment deferral, which has
decreased approximately $4.6 billion from the third quarter, and
$15.1 billion from the second quarter. Predominantly all clients that
exited deferral are current or

have paid down their loans, and the Firm has not experienced
significant new payment deferral requests. The Firm continues to
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals
throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the
borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled
payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued
interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

(a) Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment deferral, divided by the respective industry total retained loans balance.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant
modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals
and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs,
either because the modifications were insignificant or they
qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended
by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. A portion of the $1.6
billion of loans under payment deferral as December 31,

2020 could become TDRs in future periods, depending on the
nature and timing of further modifications or payment
arrangements offered to these borrowers. If the $1.6 billion of
loans under payment deferral were considered TDRs, the Firm
estimates that it would result in an increase in standardized RWA
of as much as $500 million. Loans under assistance continue to be
risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk
management framework. As of December 31, 2020, predominantly
all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and
2019. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade,
and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note
12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

(d) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio, and loans at fair value.
(e) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(f) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which

protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.

(g) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that

are in a receivable position at December 31, 2020, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its
industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with
actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the
special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale
and loans at fair value, was $41.6 billion at December 31, 2020,
compared with $15.1 billion at December 31, 2019, representing
approximately 4.0% and 1.5% of total wholesale credit exposure,
respectively. The increase in total criticized exposure was largely
driven by downgrades in Consumer & Retail, Oil & Gas and Real
Estate due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a
lesser extent, net portfolio activity in Technology, Media &
Telecommunications. Predominantly all of the $41.6 billion was
performing and largely undrawn.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to
high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further
discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan
portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The
increase was driven by downgrades across multiple industries on
client credit deterioration, with the largest concentration in Real
Estate, predominantly within retail and lodging.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to
address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts
of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit
risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the
Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients
subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does
not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale
lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s
expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.

Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans
to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by
assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on
deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities).
Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required
margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit
additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when
appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Clearing services
The Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain
securities and derivative contracts. Through the provision of these
services the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its
clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by CCPs.
Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients
through the collection of adequate margin at inception and
throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease the
provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their
obligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to Note 28 for a
further discussion of clearing services.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses
derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk
positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market
risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to

the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded
derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-
the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be
exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master
netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of
the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to
collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their
short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily —
was approximately 88% and 90% at December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s
use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion
of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated
balance sheets were $79.6 billion and $49.8 billion at December 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from
market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of
the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable
master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by
the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and may be
used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the
Firm’s favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets as
defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate
measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration
other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the
Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each
counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables for the
counterparty. The following tables summarize the net derivative
receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.

exposure is in the Firm’s favor. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates
CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on
the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit
spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that
active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic
credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk
management process takes into consideration the potential impact
of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that
exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact
of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure
to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to
meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the
nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the
extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust
the CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm
risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange,
equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current
derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the
Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show
that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are
added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2020
(in billions)

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)
delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency
and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet
settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not
reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could arise
should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the
Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the
Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value
of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future
variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future
variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-
client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit
loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average
exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and
collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative
exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty
calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%
confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the
primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for
derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives
exposure management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative
exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to
be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme
measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input
for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and
other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future
time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is
used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to
calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to
manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various
exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives
used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending
activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses
(collectively, “credit portfolio management activities”). Information
on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table
below.

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage
other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities
held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit
derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management
activities.

(b) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP;
these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses
recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans
and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are
accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting
treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and
the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in
the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall
credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of
factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may
experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the
named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual
terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that
does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the
maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may
be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm
generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for
which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in
maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to
Credit derivatives in Note 5 for a detailed description of credit
derivatives.

prospect that government and other consumer relief measures set
to expire may not be extended, the Firm has placed significant
weighting on its adverse scenarios. These scenarios incorporate
more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment
rates remaining elevated throughout 2021 and 2022, ending the
fourth quarter of 2022 at approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP
ending 2022 approximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019

Management’s discussion and analysis

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. The adoption of this guidance established a single
allowance framework for all financial assets measured at
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.
This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects
credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and
considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.
Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is

presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which
covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized
within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

The allowance for credit losses increased compared with
December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the deterioration and
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, in particular in the
first half of 2020, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, consisting of:

• a net $7.4 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the

credit card portfolio, and

• a net $4.7 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs,

impacting multiple industries.

The adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $4.3
billion addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Discussion of changes in the allowance during 2020
The increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending-related
commitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision
for credit losses, reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty
around the future macroeconomic environment as a result of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm’s central case reflected U.S.
unemployment rates of approximately 7% through the second
quarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until the second half of
2022. This compared with relatively low levels of unemployment of
approximately 4% throughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm’s January
1, 2020 central case.

Further, while the Firm’s January 1, 2020 central case U.S. GDP
forecast reflected a 1.7% expansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP
contracted approximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020,
the Firm’s central case assumptions reflect a return to pre-
pandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Due to elevated uncertainty in the near term outlook, driven by the
potential for increased infection rates and related lock downs
resulting from the pandemic, as well as the

The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans under
CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer,
excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of
principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising
from the investment securities portfolio or from principal
investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance
sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal
investments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate.
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a
default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by
Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality
securities. At December 31, 2020, the Treasury and CIO
investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses,
was $587.9 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities
comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
83–84 and Note 10 for further information on the investment
securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 135–142 for further information on the
market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 102–108 for further information on related
liquidity risk.

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee
with regular updates to the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for
reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment
securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for
investment securities are established for each risk category,
including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-traded
financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of
junior capital and span multiple asset classes. These investments
are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies. The Firm’s
investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies,
including the Firm’s commitment to support underserved
communities and minority-owned businesses. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are
reflected within their respective financial results. The aggregate
carrying values of the principal investment portfolios have not
been significantly affected by recent market events as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the duration and severity of
adverse macroeconomic conditions could subject certain principal
investments to impairments, write-downs, or other negative
impacts.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate carrying values
of the principal investment portfolios were $27.5 billion and $24.2
billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g.,
alternative energy and affordable housing investments) of $21.3
billion and $18.2 billion, respectively, and private equity, various
debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.2 billion and
$6.0 billion, respectively.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with
the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk policy
framework exists for all principal investing activities and includes
approval by executives who are independent from the investing
businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for
reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments
in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance
structure, approved levels for investments are established and
monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to
manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts
stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other
risk events.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in
market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity
and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the
Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient
risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance
and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for
senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market
Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:

• Maintaining a market risk policy framework

• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB,

Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk
There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore
Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical
and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk (VaR)
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns
• Earnings-at-risk
• Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of
limits set in the context of the market environment and business
strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into
consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity,
accommodation of client business, and management experience.
Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm
level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as
profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs
and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and
updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible
for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an
ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified
time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior
management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for
adhering to established limits against which exposures are
monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to
limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and
senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk
Management consults with appropriate members of the Firm to
determine the suitable course of action required to return the
applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction
in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary
increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client
activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-
level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by
leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and
are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict
losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or
severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those observed
at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion
on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 151.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing
market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement,
and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures
accordingly over time. This is increasingly important in periods of
sustained, heightened market volatility.

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market
risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the extent
principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the table below. Refer to

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to
estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the
current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework
used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market
values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes
in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk
Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and
Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides
the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-
day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR
provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and
levels of diversification across product types and is used for
aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR
results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors
and regulators.

Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming
current changes in market values are consistent with the historical
changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur
VaR “backtesting exceptions,” defined as losses greater than that
predicted by VaR estimates, an average of five times every 100
trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed
can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting
exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of
historical data used in the VaR calculation.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR
models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk
factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as
part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive
VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose
activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular
and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily
changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are
selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities
and historical time series used to generate daily market values
may be different across product types or risk management
systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are
aggregated at the Firm level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of
market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition,
based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time
horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in
their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses,
particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or
severe shifts in market conditions.

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in
VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate
historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for
these and other products when daily time series are not available.
It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these
products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The
Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as
stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its
market risk positions.

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than
the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in
its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market
prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR
historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to
Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s
valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data
and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use
the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR
model calculations.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and
enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the
Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors.
Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 151 for
information regarding model reviews and approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used
to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements
under Basel III. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently
assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail
loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level.
Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by
Basel III, which may be different than the positions included in the
Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative
hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk
Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit
derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk
Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the
diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional
information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to

imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not

meaningful.

(c) Maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR was higher than the prior year, due to increases in the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by a private equity position that became

publicly traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020.

Generally, average VaR and maximum VaR across risk types and
LOBs were higher due to increased volatility that occurred at the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remains in the one-year
historical look-back period. As a result average total VaR
increased by $52 million for the year-ended December 31, 2020
when compared with the prior year driven by the fixed income and
commodities risk types.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate
exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair
value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in
other sensitivity-based measures. Additionally, effective July 1,
2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-
backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other
sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk
from these loans. In the absence of these refinements, the
average Total VaR and each of the components would have been
higher by the amounts reported in the following table:

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that
are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s revenue results as they exclude
select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading
and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains
and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the year ended
December 31, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s
Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 162 of the 260 days, and observed 10 VaR backtesting
exceptions, which were predominantly driven by volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that was materially higher than the levels
realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed
Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each
metric are different and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above.
For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 74-75.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures
Stress testing
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess
risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in
markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing
reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of
market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress
testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range
of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The
results are used to understand the exposures responsible for
those potential losses and are measured against limits.

The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions
in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate
multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and
market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors
such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates
and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to
capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how
the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously.
Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress
basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress
framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test
the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing
results are reported on a regular basis to senior management of
the Firm, as appropriate.

Stress scenarios are governed by an overall stress framework and
are subject to the standards outlined in the Firm’s policies related
to model risk management. Significant changes to the framework
are reviewed as appropriate.

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the
Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported to
the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are
incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are
reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.

Profit and loss drawdowns
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses
above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown
is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net
income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the
Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only
from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking
activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment
securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 for a summary
by

LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-
risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest
rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by
the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in
partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest
rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including
the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural
interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function
reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for
providing independent oversight and governance around
assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural
interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk
generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest
rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors,
including:

• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets,

liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance
sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same
time

• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term

market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope
of the yield curve)

• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets,

liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates
change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and
liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units
transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds
transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest
rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets.
These elements include asset and liability balances and
contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment
schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset
dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any
interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s
interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses
market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this
baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities
denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S.
dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained
loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer
pricing of positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-
based measures as described on page 136.

140

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing
multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift
involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an
equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term
rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield
curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors,
including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes

in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and
reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about
actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and
customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes.
Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest
rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying
contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical experience.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,

represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change
upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The
deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual
deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated
and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the
Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements
in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant
measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk
analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest
income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table
below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December
31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 reflected updates to the
Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and long-term rates as well as
the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. In addition,
during the fourth quarter of 2020 as part of the Firm’s continuous
evaluation and periodic enhancement to its earnings-at-risk
calculations, the Firm updated the deposit rates paid betas for
consumer deposit products based upon observed pricing during
the most recent economic cycle. In the absence of this update, the
Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2020 would
have been lower by $2.0 billion to the +100bps shift in short-term
and parallel rate scenarios.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of December 31,
2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative
interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate
environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest
rate policy. While the impact of negative interest rates on the
Firm's earnings-at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift
downward of up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest
income. In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table
below.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results.
The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment
securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily
manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other
comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant
business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based
measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive instruments that are not
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being
hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual
country. The use of different measurement approaches or
assumptions could affect the amount of reported country
exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:
• Lending exposures are measured at the total committed

amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit
losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral
received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with

central and commercial banks

• Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable

balance, net of eligible collateral received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all

positions, including both long and short positions

• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured
at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible
collateral received

• Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is reported
based on the underlying reference entity and is measured at
the notional amount of protection purchased or sold, net of the
fair value of the recognized derivative receivable or payable.
Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s
market-making activities is measured on a net basis, as such
activities often result in selling and purchasing protection
related to the same underlying reference entity; this reflects the
manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting
provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. Refer to
Cross-border outstandings on page 318 of the 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on the FFIEC’s reporting methodology.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to
country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other
significant developments which adversely affect the value of the
Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries.
The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various
portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and
measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk management
function that assesses, manages and monitors country risk
originated across the Firm.

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the
following activities:
• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with

a comprehensive country risk framework

• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress

across the Firm

• Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends

and limit breaches to senior management

• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and

ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk
concerns

• Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-
border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with
both government and private-sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach,
attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the
country where the largest proportion of the assets of the
counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the
largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different
than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s
risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the
counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that
country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to
a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for
example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in
the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the
nature of the counterparty, issuer,

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk
management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses
arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse
asset price movements to a country based on market shocks
combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of
countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector
performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks.
These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk
reduction across the Firm, as necessary.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging existing stress testing, exposure
reporting and controls, as well as tailored analysis, to assess the
extent to which individual countries may be adversely impacted.

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly,
and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends, and
monitor high usages and breaches against limits.

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report
exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including
Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories,
separately from the independent sovereign states with which they
are associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2020, and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2019. The selection of
countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk
management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of
any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country
exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity
and market flows.

The overall increase in top 20 exposures was largely driven by
client activity and growth in client deposits, relative to the period
ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in cash
placements with the central banks of Germany and the United
Kingdom.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors;
or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems;
Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the
Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including
fraudulent acts, business interruptions, cyber attacks,
inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management
attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of
the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses,
and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”)
Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern,
identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the
Firm’s operational risk.

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of
operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which
consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is
responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework
and the evaluation of the effectiveness of their control
environments to determine where targeted remediation efforts may
be required.

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for
Operational Risk is responsible for defining the CCOR
Management Framework and establishing minimum standards for
its execution. Operational Risk Officers (“OROs”) report to both the
LOB CROs and to the FRE for Operational Risk, and are
independent of the respective businesses or functions they
oversee.

The Firm’s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR
Management Framework for the Firm. The CCOR Management
Framework is articulated in the Risk Governance and Oversight
Policy which is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk
Committee periodically.

Operational Risk identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment
process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of
this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness
of their control environment to assess where controls have failed,
and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of these
activities and may also perform independent assessments of
significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or
emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs independent risk
assessments of the Firm’s operational risks, which includes
assessing the effectiveness of the control environment and
reporting the results to senior management.

In addition, operational risk measurement includes operational
risk-based capital and operational risk loss projections under both
baseline and stressed conditions.

The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is
the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which
simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss
projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to
estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates
actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the
period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation
generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or
business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated
or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s
operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the
Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal
and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk
captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and
evaluation of key business environment and internal control
metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its
AMA estimate of operational risk capital.

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on
operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of
material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed
environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework
is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other
stress testing processes.

Refer to Capital Risk Management section, on pages 91-101 for
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk
and Compliance are leveraged as one of the key criteria in the
independent monitoring and testing of the LOBs and Corporate’s
compliance with laws and regulation. Through monitoring and
testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify
areas of operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls
within the LOBs and Corporate.

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring
and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be
remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate
operational risk. Operational Risk and

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

145

Management’s discussion and analysis

Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the
development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for employees at
the Firm. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are
escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control
Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has
established standards to ensure that consistent operational risk
reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide
basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes
the evaluation of key risk indicators and key performance
indicators against established thresholds as well as the
assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk
appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior
management and to the Board of Directors.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Under the CCOR Management Framework, Operational Risk and
Compliance monitors and assesses COVID-19 related legal and
regulatory developments associated with the Firm’s financial
products and services offered to clients and customers as part of
the existing change management process. The Firm will continue
to review and assess the impact of the pandemic on operational
risk and implement adequate measures as needed.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational
risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal
risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational
risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s
operational risk measurement processes. Refer to pages 148,
149, 150 and 151, respectively for more information on
Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk.
Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided
below.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm or loss
resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors.
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus
for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and
enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks
and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are
designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity
attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to
confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service,
sabotage systems or cause other damage.

Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential
new threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the
introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm
continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber
defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the
appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of
cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance
defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity

threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions of
cybersecurity risks with law enforcement, government officials,
peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to
educate employees and certain clients on the topic of
cybersecurity risks.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate
the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain,
exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial
intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.
Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or
failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or
cyberattacks could affect their ability to deliver a product or service
to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm
or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the
Firm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the
Firm’s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm
engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors
and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to
improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as
a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own
systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses
incurred.

To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s
infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a
cybersecurity program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to
cyberattacks. The Audit Committee is updated periodically on the
Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended changes,
cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve
security, as well as its efforts regarding significant cybersecurity
events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response
plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law
enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients
and customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the
IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to
a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.
Due to the impact of COVID-19, the Firm increased the use of
remote access and also video conferencing solutions provided by
third parties to facilitate remote work. As a result the Firm took
additional precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are
responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s Information
Security Program. In partnership with the Firm’s LOBs and
Corporate, the Cybersecurity and Technology Control organization
identifies information security risk issues and oversees programs
for the technological protection of the Firm’s information resources
including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential and
personal information related to the Firm’s customers. The
Cybersecurity and Technology organization consists of business
aligned information security managers that are supported within
the organization by the following products that execute the
Information Security Program for the Firm:
• Cyber Defense & Fraud

146

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties
unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through
misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The risk of payment
fraud remains at a heightened level across the industry,
particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the use
of contingent forms of payment authentication methods, scams
involving the pandemic being perpetrated including an increase in
the level of fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of
these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators continue to
evolve. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment
fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and
awareness trainings. The Firm’s monitoring of customer behavior
to detect new fraud strategies is periodically evaluated and
enhanced in an effort to mitigate these fraud risks.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates
Oversight (“IAO”) framework assist the LOBs and Corporate in
selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing
their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates.
The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers to a
high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks
including data loss and business disruption. The Corporate Third-
Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training,
monitoring, reporting and standards.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is
through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases
insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned
captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be
required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.

• Data Management, Protection & Privacy

•

Identity & Access Management

• Governance & Controls

• Production Management & Resiliency

• Software & Platform Enablement

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control governance
structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information
security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to
disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These
forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm and
include representatives from each LOB and Corporate. Reports
containing overviews of key technology risks and efforts to
enhance related controls are produced for these forums, and are
reviewed by management at multiple levels. The forums are used
to escalate information security risks or other matters as
appropriate.

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to
identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that
reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security
Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the
expectation that employees comply with these policies. The
Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training
on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the
Firm’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all
employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests.
Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees
to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-
focused training includes information about confidentiality and
security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of
information.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics,
severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents,
failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattack,
flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health emergencies. The safety
of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority.
The Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to
recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e.,
staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business
interruption. The program includes governance, awareness
training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and
tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of
the Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in
maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after
various events.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of
failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct
and standards of self-regulatory organizations.

Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO
and FRE for Operational Risk.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate hold primary ownership of and
accountability for managing compliance risk. The Firm’s
Operational Risk and Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk
and Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and
Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight
of business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws,
rules, and regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s
products and services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and
regulations depending on the LOB and the jurisdiction, and include
risks related to financial products and services, relationships and
interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities.
For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-
money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct,
and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related to the
offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders.
Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities,
including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care
(such as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of
clients and customers or to treat clients and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of
responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test,
manage, and report on compliance risk.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance
risk through the implementation of the CCOR Risk Management
Framework. The Firm’s CCO also provides regular updates to the
Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee. In certain Special
Purpose Committees of the Board have previously been
established to oversee the Firm’s compliance with regulatory
Consent Orders.

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the
Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with
integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern
employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one
another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the
Firm does business. The Code requires employees to promptly
report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any internal
Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s
business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct,
or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by
any of the Firm’s employees, clients, customers, suppliers,
contract workers, business partners, or agents. All newly hired
employees are assigned Code training and current employees are
periodically assigned Code training on an ongoing basis.
Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code
periodically.

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the
Code through the JPMC Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet.
The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions
where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all
times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an
outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against
anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically,
the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct
program.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any
action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to
unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the
markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s
reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement,
ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s
How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”). The Principles
serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct
themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s
Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and
provides information and resources to help employees conduct
business ethically and in compliance with the laws everywhere the
Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page
148 for further discussion of the Code.

Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR
Management policy, which establishes the framework for
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing,
management and reporting conduct risk in the Firm.

The Firm has a senior committee that provides oversight of the
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in
order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus. This
committee is responsible for setting overall program direction for
strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee conduct
framework and review the consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk
Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of
people management practices throughout the employee life cycle,
including recruiting, onboarding, training and development,
performance management, promotion and compensation
processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and designated
corporate functions completes an assessment of conduct risk
periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve
conduct risk, and provides business conduct training as
appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss
primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal
obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which
the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and
products and services offered by the Firm.

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and
advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s
exposure to legal risk by:

• managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement

matters, including internal reviews and investigations related to
such matters

• advising on products and services, including contract

negotiation and documentation

• advising on offering and marketing documents and new

business initiatives

• managing dispute resolution

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising
on changes to them

• advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and

proposed laws, rules and regulations, and

• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate, functions and

the Board.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm
on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition,
Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s
wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create
conflicts of interest for the Firm.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member
of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the
Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and
other members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the
Firm’s Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee. 

Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises the
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is
the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on
incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-based
estimations across various businesses and functions. The
estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are
used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and
measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements,
conducting stress testing, and making business decisions. A
dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and
Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating
to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain
analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in
risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and
analysis.

The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations
within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach to the
approach used for models, which is described in detail below.

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm
based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and
developers of models are responsible for developing,
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models
to the MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been
approved, model users and developers are responsible for
maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and
evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis.
Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in
response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market
developments, as well as to capture improvements in available
modeling techniques and systems capabilities.

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their
complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s
reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the
MRGR. In its review of a model, the MRGR considers whether the
model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used.
When reviewing a model, the MRGR analyzes and challenges the
model methodology and the reasonableness of model
assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing,
including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are
approved by the appropriate level of management within the
MRGR based on the relevant model tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,
the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material
changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the
operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may
be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to
review or approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in
the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may
include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision
or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic
environment. This is particularly true when the current and
forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical
macroeconomic environments upon which the models were
trained, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19
pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of
judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs
than in typical periods.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages
152-155 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and
other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are
integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most
complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended
to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made
as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently
reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors,
the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and
risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its
assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief
description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which

covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a
number of matters including development and weighting of
macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss
experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining
expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the
Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic
forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter
forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter
forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables
(“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with
modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less
than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and
geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, house price index (“HPI”) and U.S. real gross
domestic product (“GDP”).

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP,
U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit
spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic
conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit
losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to
significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to
the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and
weak overall economic conditions that will continue to affect
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending
portfolios. Significant judgment is required to estimate the severity
and duration of the current economic downturn, as well as its
potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities. In
particular, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the
duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain
highly uncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how borrower
behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic
conditions. The effectiveness of government support, customer
assistance and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as
mitigants to credit losses, but the extent of the mitigation impact
remains uncertain.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or
input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because
management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors
and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may
not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and
changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,
such that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic
forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined
using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios,
which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The
central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those
variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario described
on page 132 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario
assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate
throughout 2021, averaging 3.0% higher over the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.0% in the
second quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower
recovery,

152

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K

remaining nearly 2.6% lower at the end of the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of nearly 4.1% in the third quarter
of 2021; and a 10.1% further deterioration in the national HPI with
a trough in the first quarter of 2022.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes
in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons,
including:

• the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios
in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of December 31,
2020, and accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects
credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and

nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply
extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic
variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a speed
and to degrees not seen in recent history, adding significantly
higher degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss
estimations

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the
economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
effects of government support and customer assistance, and the
speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the
Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the
estimated sensitivities described below.

Without considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on
its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses for the lending exposures noted below, the difference
between the modeled estimates under the Firm’s relative adverse
and central scenarios at December 31, 2020 would result in the
following:

• An increase of approximately $700 million for residential real

estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $5.1 billion for credit card loans

• An increase of approximately $2.8 billion for wholesale loans

and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for
credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other
adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled
lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of
these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current
circumstances and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and

uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of
expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the
period ended December 31, 2020.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair
value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives and
structured note products. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain
mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value
is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the

impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.7 billion of derivative receivables
classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is
not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the
valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were
applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set
out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally
developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that
use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to
estimate fair value are more significant than those required when
estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1
and 2.

Management’s discussion and analysis

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level
3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation
model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires management to
assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs
including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest
rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations,
prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3
instruments, including unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the
Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that
meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The
judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and
its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the
product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened
market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by
the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly
for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other
factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a
particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of
other market participants, the methods and assumptions used
reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the
determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note
2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial
instruments.

Goodwill impairment
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units
and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process
and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is
described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill
for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business
combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill
impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-
19 pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost of
equity, as well as actual business results and projections of
business

performance for all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that
the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of
December 31, 2020. The fair values of these reporting units
exceeded their carrying values by at least 15% and did not
indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current
projections and valuations.

The projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units are consistent
with management’s current business outlook assumptions in the
short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and
return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses
third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and
estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including
the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2020.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based
on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the
rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that
an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the
points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash
(predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and
travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder
redeems points. This liability was $7.7 billion and $6.4 billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is recorded in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) and cost
per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to
estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be
redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is
used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These
assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical
actuals and cardholder redemption behavior and updates to them
will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2020, a
combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in
CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $215
million.

Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various
jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and
local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex
and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the
financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes,
including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized
tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax
laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as
make judgments regarding the timing of when

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and
judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.

certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S.
tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are
subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities
in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may
occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over
interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by
audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan
Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional
income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the
Firm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in
income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is
possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may
materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting
period.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and
deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between
assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus
income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if,
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be
more likely than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax
assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”)
carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain
whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews
include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding
future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax
planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to
utilize NOLs before they expire. In connection with these reviews,
if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a
valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may
be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm
determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable
income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than
not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable.
As of December 31, 2020, management has determined it is more
likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net
of the existing valuation allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when
additional information becomes available. Uncertain tax positions
that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An
uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit
that management believes is more likely than not to be realized
upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan
Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on
its effective income tax rate in the period in which the
reassessment occurs.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.

Standard

Summary of guidance

Effects on financial statements

• Adopted January 1, 2020.
• Refer to Note 1 for further information.

• Establishes a single allowance framework for all financial

assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance
sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that
management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the
instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected
future changes in macroeconomic conditions.

• Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires

recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to
the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets
purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration
since origination, with a corresponding increase in the
amortized cost of the related loans.

• Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the
cumulative amount of prior writeoffs, when estimating the
allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets
(including collateral-dependent assets).

• Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to
incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of
credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer
improves.

• Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings

as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption.

• Refer to Note 15 for further information.

• Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021

update was effective when issued.

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients

related to contract modifications and hedge accounting
relationships, and discounting transition beginning in the third
quarter of 2020. The discounting transition election was applied
retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical expedients is
to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts
impacted by reference rate reform, and these elections did not
have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current
accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge
accounting relationships, and other transactions are amended
due to reference rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain contract

amendments related to reference rate reform as modifications
rather than extinguishments without the requirement to assess
the significance of the amendments.

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge accounting

relationship without automatic termination of that relationship.
Provides various practical expedients and elections designed
to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted during the
transition period.

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the

held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to account for
derivatives modified to change the rate used for discounting,
margining, or contract price alignment (collectively “discounting
transition”) as modifications.
