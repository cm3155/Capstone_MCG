Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $49.6 billion for 
2023, up 32%, earnings per share of $16.23, ROE of 17% 
and ROTCE of 21%.
• Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%, 

reflecting: 

– Net interest income (“NII”) of $89.3 billion, up 34%, 

driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and 
higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially 
offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower 
average deposit balances. NII excluding Markets was 
$90.0 billion, up 44%. 

– Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $68.8 billion, up 

11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including 
the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, 
higher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset 
management fees, partially offset by the absence of the 
gain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, 
higher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and 
lower auto operating lease income.

• Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, 

predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, 
reflecting an increase in employees, primarily in 
technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The 
increase in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC 
special assessment and costs associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. 

• The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, 

reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. 
Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, predominantly 
driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single 
name exposures in wholesale. The net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses included: 

– a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer, 

predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in 
Card Services driven by loan growth, including an 
increase in revolving balances, partially offset by a net 
reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and

– a net addition of $657 million in wholesale, driven by 

net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the 
outlook for commercial real estate in CB. 

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish 
the allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses and net 
charge-offs of $2.9 billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at 
December 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, 
compared with 1.81% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at 
December 31, 2023, up 5%, predominantly driven by 
wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of 
downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–130 and pages 
114–119, respectively, for additional information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, 
predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, 
primarily as a result of First Republic. 

Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $251 billion, and the Standardized and 

Advanced CET1 ratios were both 15.0%.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down 

• SLR was 6.1%.

4%, driven by

– continued migration into higher-yielding investments in 
AWM, the impact of higher customer spending in CCB, 
continued deposit attrition in CB, and a net decline in 
CIB, which included actions taken to reduce certain 
deposits,

partially offset by

– the increase in deposits associated with First Republic, 

and growth related to the Firm’s international 
consumer initiatives in Corporate.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 
for additional information.

• TBVPS grew 18%, ending 2023 at $86.08.

• As of December 31, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-of-

period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of 
approximately $798 billion and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of approximately 
$649 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of 
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 102–109 for additional information.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and 
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 54–57 and 
pages 58–60, respectively, for a further discussion of the 
Firm's results, including the provision for credit losses; and 
Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic acquisition.

excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed 
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to

Recent events
• On February 6, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced that it 
plans to open more than 500 new branches, renovate 
approximately 1,700 locations and hire 3,500 employees 
over the next three years.

• On January 25, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced new 

responsibilities for several key executives:

– Jennifer Piepszak, formerly the Co-Chief Executive 

Officer (“CEO”) of CCB, and Troy Rohrbaugh, formerly 
the Co-head of Markets and Securities Services, became 
Co-CEOs of the expanded Commercial & Investment 
Bank, which brings together the Firm’s major wholesale 
businesses consisting of Global Investment Banking, 
Commercial Banking and Corporate Banking, as well as 
Markets, Securities Services and Global Payments.

– Marianne Lake, the former Co-CEO of CCB, became the 

sole CEO of that business.

– James Dimon, Chairman and CEO, and Daniel Pinto, 

President and Chief Operating Officer, will continue to 
jointly manage the company, with Mr. Pinto focusing on 
the execution of the Firm’s LOB priorities.

As a result of these organizational changes, the Firm will

effective in the second quarter of 2024.

• On January 16, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced that 
Mark Weinberger, 62, had been elected to its Board of

of Ernst & Young from 2013 to 2019.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 161 and Part I, Item 
1A, Risk Factors section on pages 9-33 of this Form 10-K for 
a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties 
and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s 
actual results to differ materially because of those risks and 
uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 
2024 will be in line with the outlook information set forth 
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any 
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2024 should 
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical 
environment, the competitive environment, client and 
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative 
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the 
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the 
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make 
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in 
response to ongoing developments in the business, 
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it 
operates.

Full-year 2024
• Management expects net interest income to be 
approximately $90 billion, market dependent. 

• Management expects net interest income excluding 
Markets to be approximately $88 billion, market 
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be 
approximately $90 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card 

Services to be less than 3.50%.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted 
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 62–64.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Business Developments
First Republic acquisition
On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 
"First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. 

JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of 
and for the period ended December 31, 2023 reflect the 
impact of First Republic. Where meaningful to the  
disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition, as 
well as subsequent related business and activities, are 
disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-K. The Firm 
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate 
clients, products and services, associated with the First 
Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and 
operations. 

Refer to Note 34 and page 67 for additional information 
related to First Republic.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition 
The publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. 
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 
(“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and six-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be 
published on a "synthetic" basis, which will allow market 
participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR-
linked contracts through September 30, 2024. 

As part of the Firm’s overall transition efforts which 
culminated in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm 
successfully completed the conversion of predominantly all 
of its remaining cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. 
dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
(“SOFR”) as part of initiatives by the principal central 
counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives prior 
to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s other U.S. dollar 
LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR 
Cessation have been remediated through contractual 
fallback provisions or through the framework provided by 
the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”). The 
Firm expects that the limited number of contracts 
remaining that reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR will 
be remediated by September 30, 2024.

respectively. Also includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to 
Note 6 for additional information.

(b) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for the 

year ended December 31, 2023, in Corporate associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67, 
and Notes 6 and 34 for additional information.

2023 compared with 2022
Investment banking fees decreased, reflecting in CIB:

revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets 
net interest income, primarily due to higher funding 
costs; and

• losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other 

compared with $836 million in the prior year.

The prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale 
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge 
financing portfolio in CIB and CB.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also included 
the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities 
in Treasury and CIO, reflective of the current interest rate 
environment.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets 
across other revenue lines, including net interest income. 
The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business 
on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 72–77 
and pages 84–85, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting:

• lower advisory fees due to a lower number of completed 
transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced 
deals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging 
environment, and

• higher lending-related revenue driven by the 

amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired 
lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic, primarily in AWM and CB,

• lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market 

predominantly offset by

• lower deposit-related fees in CB and CIB driven by the 
higher level of client credits that reduce such fees. 

Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages 72–77, 
pages 78–80 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Asset management fees increased driven by strong net 
inflows and the removal of most money market fund fee 
waivers in the prior year in AWM, and in CCB the impact of 
First Republic, as well as higher average market levels and 
strong net inflows. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results 
on pages 68–71 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 
for additional information. 

conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted 
in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, 
investment-grade loans and high-grade bonds. This was 
largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield 
bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance,

partially offset by

• higher equity underwriting fees driven by a higher level 

of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market 
volatility and a higher level of convertible securities 
offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially 
offset by lower activity in private placements amid a 
challenging environment.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 72–77 and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB:

• higher Equity Markets principal transactions revenue in 

Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, 

• higher Fixed Income Markets principal transactions 
revenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income

The prior year included:

• a gain of $914 million on the sale of Visa B shares and 

proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and

• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial 

satisfaction of a loan in CB.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 
for additional information on the First Republic acquisition; 
Note 5 for additional information on net investment hedges; 
and Note 6 for further information.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates, the 
impact of First Republic, and higher revolving balances in 
Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest 
income and lower average deposit balances.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 
trillion, down $23 billion, and the yield was 5.14%, up 236 
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an 
FTE basis, was 2.70%, an increase of 70 bps. The net yield 
excluding Markets was 3.85%, up 125 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest 
and rates schedule on pages 310-314 for further 
information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP 
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation 
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
62–64 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding 
Markets.

Commissions and other fees increased due to higher 
commissions on annuity sales and travel-related services in 
CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 68–71 and 
Note 6 for additional information. 

Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on 
higher sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio in both periods in Treasury 
and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–
85 and Note 10 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income: refer to CCB segment 
results on pages 68–71, Note 6 and 15 for further 
information.

Card income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting growth in 
merchant processing volume and Commercial Card 
transactions in J.P. Morgan Payments; and in CCB, driven by 
higher net interchange income on increased debit and 
credit card sales volume. Refer to Business Segment 
Results, CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 65–85, 
pages 68–71, pages 72–77 and pages 78–80, respectively, 
and Note 6 for further information.

Other income increased, reflecting: 

• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in 

Corporate associated with the First Republic acquisition,

• the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 

and

• a gain of $339 million recognized in the first quarter of 
2023 in AWM on the original minority interest in China 
International Fund Management (“CIFM”) upon the Firm's 
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline 

in volume,

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 

investments, and

• the net impact of equity investments in CIB, including 

impairment losses in the second half of 2023,

The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of 
$2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, 
driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in 
the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually receded, and net charge-offs of $2.9 
billion. 

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 68–71, 
CIB on pages 72–77, CB on pages 78–80, AWM on pages 
81–83, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 131–133,

Total provision for credit losses

$  9,320  $  6,389  $  (9,256) 

2023 compared with 2022
The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting 
$6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition of $3.1 
billion to the allowance for credit losses. 

Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, consisting of $2.6 
billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, 
as the portfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic 
levels, and $698 million in wholesale.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included 
$1.9 billion, consisting of:

• $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
reflecting a $1.4 billion net addition in Card Services, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in 
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was 
driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving 
balances, partially offset by reduced borrower 
uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was 
driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; 
and

• $657 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a 
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in 
CB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan 
and lending-related commitment portfolios.

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and 
local taxes,

• lower benefits associated with tax audit settlements, and
•  vesting of employee stock based awards,
largely offset by 

• the impact of the income tax expense associated with the 

First Republic acquisition that was reflected in the 
estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in a 
reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate, and 

• an income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain 

income tax regulations.

expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with respect to 
individuals associated with First Republic who did not become 
employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023. Refer to Business Segment 
Results on page 67 for additional information.

2023 compared with 2022
Compensation expense increased driven by:

• an increase in employees, primarily in technology and 

front office, as well as wage inflation,

• the impact of First Republic in the second half of 2023, 

predominantly in CCB and Corporate, and

• higher volume- and revenue-related compensation 

predominantly in AWM and CCB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher FDIC-related expense, which included the $2.9 
billion special assessment recognized in Corporate,

• the impact of First Republic in Corporate and CCB, 

• higher legal expense in CIB, Corporate and CCB,

• higher investments in the business, including marketing 

and technology, and

• higher other expenses, including higher indirect tax 
expense in CIB, and higher travel and entertainment 
expense across the segments, 

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased reflecting the higher level of excess cash placed 
with the Federal Reserve Banks. The Firm’s excess cash 
primarily resulted from:
• the net issuance of long-term debt, and
• the impact of maturities and paydowns of investment 

securities in Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by
• the impacts associated with the First Republic acquisition 

in the first half of 2023.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased, reflecting a reduction in client-
driven market-making activities, partially offset by higher 
cash deployment in Treasury and CIO.
Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting a higher demand for securities to cover short 
positions and client-driven activities.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets increased, reflecting in Markets higher debt 
and equity instruments on client-driven market-making 
activities, partially offset by lower derivative receivables, 
primarily as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 
and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities decreased due to:
• lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven by 

maturities and paydowns, predominantly offset by the 
impact of First Republic, net purchases, and the transfer 
of securities from held-to-maturity (“HTM”) in the first

quarter of 2023, and

• lower HTM securities driven by maturities and paydowns, 

and the transfer of securities to AFS.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–85, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 134 and 
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment 
securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• $146 billion of loans associated with First Republic,
• growth in new accounts in Card Services, as well as higher 
revolving balances, which continued to normalize to pre-
pandemic levels, and 

• growth in Auto loans due to net originations.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting:
• a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $2.2 

billion, consisting of:
– $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan 
growth, including an increase in revolving balances, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $176 million in 
Home Lending, and

– $930 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, and 
• $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the First 

Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.

The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of the 
adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: 
Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance.

References in this Form 10-K to "changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this 
guidance.
There was also a $408 million net reduction in the 
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit and 
Investment Risk Management on pages 54–57 and pages 
111–134, respectively, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for 
additional information on loans and the total allowance for 
credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 67 and 
Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition. 
Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased due 
to lower client receivables related to client-driven activities 
in Markets.

Premises and equipment increased as a result of the 
construction-in-process associated with the Firm's 
headquarters, the First Republic acquisition, largely lease 
right-of-use assets, and higher capitalized software. Refer 
to Note 16 and 18 for additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased 
predominantly due to: 
• other intangibles and goodwill related to the acquisition 

of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM, 

• core deposit intangibles associated with the First 

Republic acquisition, and

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions primarily from 
purchases, and the impact of higher interest rates, 
partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows.

Refer to Note 15 and 34 for additional information.
Other assets decreased reflecting the impact of the change 
in the type of collateral placed with CCPs from cash to 
securities.

Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of:
• higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured 
notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit 
inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and 
Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, 
including actions taken to reduce certain deposits,

• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 

consumer initiatives,

• lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer 

spending,

• a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higher-
yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate 
environment, predominantly offset by growth from new 
and existing customers as a result of new product 
offerings, and

• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 

clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly 
offset by the retention of inflows associated with 
disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.

The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits 
associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, 
AWM and CB.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased, reflecting the 
impact of a lower level of netting on reduced repurchase 
activity.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for 
additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased 
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, 
and short-term borrowings; Notes 2 and 17 for deposits 
and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and securities 
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements; Business 
Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for additional 
information on the First Republic acquisition.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in 
higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, 
partially offset by lower derivative payables primarily as a 
result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for 
additional information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased primarily 
due to lower client payables related to client-driven 
activities in Markets, partially offset by higher accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities, including the $2.9 billion 
payable related to the FDIC special assessment. Refer to 
Note 19 for additional information.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased 
in CIB primarily driven by higher levels of Firm-
administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper held by 
third parties, reflecting changes in the Firm’s short-term 
liquidity management. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management 
on pages 102–109; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional 
information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization 
trusts.
Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of First 
Republic, which included the Purchase Money Note issued 
to the FDIC and additional FHLB advances, as well as net 
issuance consistent with the Firm’s long-term funding plans. 
The increase was also attributable to net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an 
increase in fair value. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management 
on pages 102–109 and Note 34 for additional information 
on the First Republic acquisition.
Stockholders’ equity: refer to Consolidated Statements of 
changes in stockholders’ equity on page 169, Capital

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.

• In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, 
lower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts 
receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, 
lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher 
securities borrowed. 

• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts 

payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, 
and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and 
paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher 
trading assets.

Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.

• In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds from 

investment securities, proceeds from sales and 
securitizations of loans held-for-investment and lower 
securities purchased under resale agreements, largely 
offset by net originations of loans and net cash used in 
the First Republic Bank acquisition.

• In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of 
loans and higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from 
investment securities.

Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.

• In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which 

included the impact of the repayment of the deposits 
provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of 
large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the 
First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher 
securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net 
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.

• In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially 
offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term 
borrowings.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 166–170. That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial 
statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow 

management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and therefore 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 65–85 for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be 
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial 
measures used by other companies. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and 
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also 
reviews these metrics excluding Markets, as shown below. 
Markets consists of CIB’s Fixed Income Markets and Equity 
Markets. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-
GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these 
metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, 
investing (including asset-liability management) and 
deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility 
associated with Markets activities. In addition, management 
also assesses Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. 
Management believes that these measures provide 
investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze 
the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures

Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as 
follows:

Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end

Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue

ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets

ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity

ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity

TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end

* Represents net income applicable to common equity

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures 
such as:
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 

excluding Firmwide legal expense, and

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less total noninterest expense.

Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s 
performance.

The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to 
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and 
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more 
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., 
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related 
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. 
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by 
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, 
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate 
segment. 

The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they 
reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are 
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on 
pages 62–64 for a definition of managed basis.

(a) As a result of the organizational changes that were announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the 

manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. 
Refer to Recent events on page 52 for additional information.

Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and therefore further 
refinements may be implemented in future periods. The 
Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB 
on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and 
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the 
participating business segments may agree to share 
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.

Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 

allocated based on the actual cost and use of services 
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations that 
are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to 
the business segments and are retained in Corporate. 
Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone 
businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a 
particular business segment.

Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and 
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities 
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the segments.

As a result of the higher interest rate environment, the cost 
of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have 
generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net 
interest income. During the period ended December 31, 
2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and

Markets activities, and contributed to margin expansion on 
deposits.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and 
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues 
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks 
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements related to the transferred risk in its results. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on page 143 for 
additional information.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital 
requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. 

The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included 
in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income 
is reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for 
additional information.

Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. The Firm’s current allocation 
methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”) and the global systemically 
important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, both under rules 
currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a 
severe stress environment. At least annually, the 
assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 for additional 
information on capital allocation.

fees. Operating lease income was $2.8 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.8 
billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively.

(b) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $1.7 billion, $2.4 

billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 
and 2021, respectively.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $131 million, $93 million

Noninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%, reflecting:

• higher compensation expense, driven by an increase in 
employees, including the impact of First Republic in the 
second half of 2023 and additions primarily in bankers, 
advisors and technology, wage inflation and higher 
revenue-related compensation, as well as 

• higher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact of 
First Republic, investments in marketing and technology,  
the increase in the FDIC assessment announced in the 
prior year as well as higher legal expense, partially offset 
by lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease 
assets.

The provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion, reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion, 

predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio 
continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels,

• a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card Services, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in 
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was 
driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving 
balances, partially offset by reduced borrower 
uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was 
driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; 
and 

• $408 million to establish the allowance for the First 

Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the 
second quarter of 2023.

The provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion, driven by 
net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a $1.1 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
111–134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 131–
133 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $21.2 billion, up 42%.

Net revenue was $70.1 billion, up 28%.

Net interest income was $55.0 billion, up 38%, driven by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset 
by lower average deposits and the impact of lower PPP 
loan forgiveness in Banking & Wealth Management 
(“BWM”), 

• higher Card Services NII, reflecting an increase in 

revolving balances, and 

• the impact of First Republic in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up 2%, driven by:

• higher asset management fees due to the impact of First 
Republic as well as higher market levels and strong net 
inflows, higher commissions on annuity sales in BWM and 
higher other service fees associated with First Republic,

• higher net interchange income on increased debit and 

credit card sales volume, and 

– In Card Services, higher annual fees and the higher net 

interchange income were more than offset by an 
increase in amortization related to new account 
origination costs, reflecting continued growth. Net 
interchange income in Card Services also reflected the 
impact of a reduction in rewards costs and partner 
payments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a 
periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed and an 
increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to 
certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 
2023;

• higher travel-related commissions in Card Services, 

predominantly offset by

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 

in volume, and

• lower mortgage fees and related income in Home 

Lending.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income,
asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; 
and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 155–158 for 
credit card rewards liability. 

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income.

Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First 
Republic acquisition.

(a) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $123 million, $187 million and $342 million, 
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to 
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as  
permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that 
were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, included $94 million, $350 
million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking 
under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit 
losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.
(d) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans 
under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic was $29 million, $449 million and $1.1 billion in Home

modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(e) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans 

insured by U.S. government agencies of $176 million, $258 million and 
$405 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These 
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 

(f) Includes First Republic. 
(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting 
guidance. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a net decrease in 
the allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential real 
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3 billion, 
down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8 billion, down 4%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion, up 1%, 
driven by an increase in finance and trading activity in the 
Securitized Products Group and improved performance in 
Credit Trading, predominantly offset by lower revenue in 
Currencies & Emerging Markets as the business 
substantially normalized from the prior year’s elevated 
levels of volatility and client activity.

• Equity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down 13%, 

driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash 
Equities, compared with a stronger performance in the 
prior year.

• Securities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, 
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, 
largely offset by lower average deposits and fees.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280 million,  
compared with a loss of $836 million in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%, driven by 
higher legal expense, compensation expense, including the 
impact of wage inflation, and higher indirect tax expense.

The provision for credit losses was $121 million, driven by 
net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190 million, driven by 
single name exposures, largely offset by a $151 million net 
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

The net reduction in the allowance was driven by the impact 
of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment 
portfolios and the net effect of changes in the Firm’s 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, predominantly 
offset by an addition for certain accounts receivable and net 
downgrade activity.

The provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion, 
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses.

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $14.1 billion, down 5%.

Net revenue was $48.8 billion, up 1%.

Banking revenue was $16.5 billion, up 7%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $6.2 billion, down 4%. 
Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale 
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge 
financing portfolio recorded in the second quarter of 
2022, Investment Banking revenue was down 8%. 
Investment Banking fees were down 5%, driven by lower 
advisory and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by 
higher equity underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for 
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, down 8%, due to a 

lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the 
lower level of announced deals in the current and the 
prior year amid a challenging environment. 

– Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down 8%, as 
challenging market conditions, primarily in the first 
half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity 
across leveraged loans, investment-grade loans, and 
high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher 
issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher 
industry-wide issuance.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 11%, 
driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to 
lower equity market volatility and a higher level of 
convertible securities offerings which benefited from 
higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private 
placements amid a challenging environment.

• Payments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven by 
deposit margin expansion on higher rates and fees, 
partially offset by the higher level of client credits that 
reduce such fees and lower average deposits. The net 
impact of equity investments was flat reflecting net 
markdowns in both periods, including the impact of an 
impairment in the current year.

• Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%, driven by 
$494 million of fair value losses on hedges of retained 
loans which included an increase in hedging activity, 
compared to $27 million of gains in the prior year, 
partially offset by higher net interest income.

difference between the price at which a market participant 
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the 
price at which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity 
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, 
which include general market conditions, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity 
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic 
conditions.  

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue 
line items. For example, securities that generate net 
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that 
are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. 

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions 
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new 
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-
related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains 
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the 
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, 
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is affected by many factors including the level 
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the

(a) The decline in Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.
(b) Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. 

The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses 
include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more 
than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on

Net income was $6.1 billion, up 46%.

Net revenue was $15.5 billion, up 35%. 

Net interest income was $12.1 billion, up 47%, driven by: 

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset 

by lower average deposits, and

• higher average loans, including the impact from First 

Republic.

Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5%, driven by: 

• higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by 
the amortization of the purchase discount on certain 
acquired lending-related commitments associated with 
First Republic, 

• net markups on held-for-sale positions, primarily 

unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, 
compared with net markdowns in the prior year, and

• higher investment banking revenue and card income,

predominantly offset by 

credits that reduce such fees, and

• the absence of a gain on an equity-method investment 

received in partial satisfaction of a loan.

Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 14%, driven by 
higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in 
employees including front office and technology, as well as 
higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new 
client acquisitions.

The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting:

weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a 
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate 
and net downgrade activity, partially offset by the impact 
of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment 
portfolios,

• $608 million to establish the allowance for the First 

Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the 
second quarter of 2023; and

• net charge-offs of $316 million, up $232 million,

The provision in the prior year was $1.3 billion, reflecting a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

2023 compared with 2022 
Net income was $5.2 billion, up 20%.

Net revenue was $19.8 billion, up 12%. Net interest 
income was $6.3 billion, up 20%. Noninterest revenue was 
$13.6 billion, up 8%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $9.1 billion, up 4%, 
driven by: 

• a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in 
CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% 
interest in the entity, and

• higher asset management fees driven by strong net 
inflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements, as well as the removal of most 
money market fund fee waivers in the prior year,

largely offset by

• lower performance fees, and

• lower NII due to higher funding costs.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7 billion, up 
20%, driven by: 

• higher net interest income on higher average loans 

associated with First Republic, and from deposit margin 
expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower 
average deposits, and 

• higher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the 
amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired 
lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic, partially offset by net investment valuation 
losses.

Noninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by higher compensation, including 
continued growth in private banking advisor teams, 
revenue-related compensation and the impacts of closing 
the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China 
acquisitions.

The provision for credit losses was $159 million, 
predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the 
allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for 
the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments 
in the second quarter of 2023. 

The provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.

• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 

management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services 
rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various 
periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% 
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the 
next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents 
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the 
worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked 
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted 
average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and 
ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year 
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of 
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to 
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star 
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other 
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the 
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.

• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 

management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three 
and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and 
the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the 
fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee 
absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at 
the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share 
class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg 
and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The performance data may have been different if all share classes had 
been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and 
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share 
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary 
share class.

(e) Income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition are 

reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain.

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $2.8 billion, compared with a net loss of 
$743 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in 
the prior year, predominantly driven by higher net interest 
income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of 
lower Firmwide average deposit balances.

Noninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a 
loss of $1.8 billion in the prior year, driven by: 

• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain 
associated with the First Republic acquisition, 

• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues 

associated with foreign exchange rate movements that 
are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and

• the impact of higher short-term cash deployment 
activities as a result of the current interest rate 
environment,

partially offset by 

• higher net investment securities losses related to the 
sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government 
agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 

investments.

The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares 
and proceeds from an insurance settlement.

Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion, 
predominantly driven by: 

• the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment,

• $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly 
driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as  
expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with 
respect to individuals associated with First Republic who 
did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023, 

• a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses 
associated with foreign exchange rate movements that 
are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO,

• higher legal expenses, and

• higher costs associated with the Firm's international 

consumer growth initiatives, 

partially offset by

• lower benefits-related and real estate expenses.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
associated with the foreign exchange risk that was 
transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and 
expenses was not material to net income. Refer to Foreign 
Exchange Risk on page 66 for additional information.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on 
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for 
credit losses.

(a) Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted new hedge accounting 
guidance. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer 
$7.1 billion of HTM securities to AFS. During 2022 and 2021, the Firm 
transferred $78.3 billion and $104.5 billion of investment securities, 
respectively, from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. Refer 
to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the new hedge 
accounting guidance.

(b) As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for credit 

losses on investment securities was $94 million, $67 million and $42 
million, respectively.

(c) As of December 31, 2023, included $24.2 billion of AFS securities 
associated with First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional 
information. 

The provision for credit losses was $171 million, reflecting 
a net addition to the allowance for credit losses related to a 
single name exposure, which was subsequently charged off 
upon the restructuring of a loan.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by:

• the finalization of certain income tax regulations, other 

tax adjustments and tax benefits associated with tax audit 
settlements,

partially offset by

• the impact from changes in the level and mix of income 

and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes 
that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. 

The income taxes associated with the First Republic 
acquisition are reflected in the estimated bargain purchase 
gain.

The prior period income tax benefit was driven by benefits 
related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax 
adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state 
and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's 
digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth 
manager in the U.K.; and a 46% ownership stake in C6 
Bank, a digital bank in Brazil.

Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in high-
quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through 
deposits at central banks and investments in short-term 
instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
102–109 for further information on liquidity and funding 
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143 
for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.

The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists 
of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and 
government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed 
securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 
2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion,

Management’s discussion and analysis

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and 
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things:  

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;  

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves 
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of 
risks. 

Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic 
environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor 
or market evolution, business decisions, process or 
judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional 
markets, and natural disasters.

Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in 
the following four risk types: 

•

•

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity, or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes in 
the operating environment. 
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including 
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk. 

• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 

changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term. 

• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 

resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or 
systems; human factors; or external events impacting the 
Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk includes 
cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and 
estimations and model risk.

Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative 
and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks 
manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a 
reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and 
fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to 
the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and 
regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a 
Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk 
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk 
Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk 
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk 
Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead 
the IRM function and maintain the risk governance 
framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to 
approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review 
and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. 

The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the 
Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of 
the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief 
Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk 
Management and Compliance organizations, develop the 
Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define 
and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that 
arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks 
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as 
functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to 
risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified 
by the IRM function, and within the risk and control 
standards established by its own management. 

Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: 

The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and 
CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their 
aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. 
The first line of defense owns the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations and the design and 
execution of controls to manage those risks. 
Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and implementation of the risk 

86

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

governance framework established by IRM, which may 
include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls. 

The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is 
separate from the first line of defense and is responsible for 
independently measuring risk, as well as assessing and 
challenging the risk management practices of the first line 
of defense. IRM is also responsible for the identification of 
risks within its respective organization, adherence to 
applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the 
development and implementation of policies and standards 
with respect to its own processes. 

The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent 
function that provides objective assessment of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, 
controls, governance and risk management. The Internal 
Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who 
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part 
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human 
Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible 
for the identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and implementation of the risk governance 
framework established by IRM.

Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations, as well as the design 
and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, 
to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has 
a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each 
LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks 
inherent to the Firm’s businesses and operational activities, 
catalog them in a central repository and review material 
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and 
challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, 
maintains the central repository and provides the 
consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk 
Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. 

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk 
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. 
The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and approved by 
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and 
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board 
Risk Committee.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels 
for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level 
committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and 
channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General 
Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is 
accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. The Operating Committee and certain other 
members of senior management are responsible for 
escalating to the Board the information necessary to 
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business 
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s 
financial performance and condition and reviewing the 
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries 
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities 
through its principal standing committees, each of which 
consists solely of independent members of the Board. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope of 
responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, 
which it discharges both acting directly and through the 
principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan 

Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board 
Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, 
with respect to compensation and other management-
related matters, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, 
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity 
of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance 
with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and 
procedures, and with laws, rules and regulations. It also 
assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, 
independence and performance of the Firm’s independent 
registered public accounting firm, and of the performance 
of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

88

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees 
oversee the risk and control environment of their respective 
business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, 
Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, 
they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or 
emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of 
compliance and operational risk in a business or function, 
addressing key compliance and operational risk issues, with 
an emphasis on processes with control concerns and 
overseeing control remediation. 

The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for 
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management 
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting 
management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk, and capital risk. 

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising 
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and 
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or 
business activity may include one or more drivers, types 
and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk 
Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of 
risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to 
multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. 

The following sections discuss the risk governance and 
oversight functions that have been established to manage 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

The Compensation & Management Development Committee 
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s 
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews 
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified 
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance 
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s 
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors 
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of 
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s 
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, 
including reviewing updates from management regarding 
significant conduct issues and any related actions with 
respect to employees, including compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews 
the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility 
matters such as community investment, fair lending, 
sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy 
issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could 
impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The 
Committee also provides guidance on these matters to 
management and the Board, as appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance 
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of 
and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for 
election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and 
recommends to the Board corporate governance practices 
applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for 
assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks 
inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for 
discussion of topics and issues that are raised or escalated 
by its members and other committees.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide compliance and operational risk environment 
including identified issues, compliance and operational risk 
metrics and significant events that have been escalated. 

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and 
controls that have been established within the scope of 
their respective activities. These committees review the 
ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses 
operating in a particular region could be exposed to 
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, 
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought 
to these committees.

Management’s discussion and analysis

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT 

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior 
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible for 
managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM 
engages regularly in strategic business discussions and 
decision-making, including participation in relevant 
business reviews and senior management meetings, risk 
and control committees and other relevant governance 
forums, and review of acquisitions and new business 
initiatives. The Board of Directors oversees management’s 
strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees 
IRM and the Firm’s risk governance framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify 
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk 
appetite. 

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic 
initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s 
strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s 
strategic framework and initiatives, and includes 
components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings 
and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the 
Firm’s Business Principles, the Operating Committee and 
senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate 
review and update the strategic plan periodically, including 
evaluating the strategic framework and performance 
against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating 
environment, refining existing strategies and developing 
new strategies.

The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s assessment, 
are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval 
of the Firm’s strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in 
the Firm's budget.  

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-
adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also 
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for further 
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 102–109 for further information on 
liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 
110 for further information on reputation risk.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient level 
or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is a 
strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO 
and Operating Committee. The Firm’s “fortress balance 
sheet” philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong 
capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk 
management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term 
stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-
leading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments. Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant 
decisions that could impact future business activities. In 
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior 
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with 
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.

Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose 
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of 
capital risk across the Firm.  

Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits 

and indicators, including capital risk appetite;

• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report 

capital limit breaches; 

• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital 

management activities, including changes made to the 
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and

• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital 

framework intended to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulatory capital rules.

Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.  

The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management 
are to:

• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through normal 
economic cycles and in stressed environments;

• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 

opportunities;

• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a 

source of strength to its subsidiaries;

• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status 
for the Firm and its principal insured depository 
institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

at all times under applicable regulatory capital 
requirements;

• Meet capital distribution objectives; and

• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 

throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through: 

• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and 
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The 
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s 
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal 
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic 
cycles and in stress events;

• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 

potential events; and

• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and 

following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, 
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the 
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 86–89 for additional discussion of 
the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank 
Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually a 
capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and 
other stress testing processes to assess whether large BHCs, 
such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during periods of 
economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-
looking capital assessment and planning processes in place 
that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb 
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the 
Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and 
internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), 
as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal 
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario 
from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s 
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming 
year. 

The Firm's current SCB requirement is 2.9%, and will 
remain in effect until September 30, 2024. The Firm’s 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including 
regulatory buffers, was 11.4% as of December 31, 2023.

Refer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital planning framework.

Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings 
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters 
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and 
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios 
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which 
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, 
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are 
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and 
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and 
other periodic stress testing, management also considers 
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as 
necessary. 

Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and in stressed 
environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how 
the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets 
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets 
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be 
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion 
during a period of stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. 
capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of 
the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount 
of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet 
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according 
to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two 
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating 
RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), 
and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). 

For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital 
adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their 
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC 
released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital 
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments 
applicable to large banking organizations and to banking 
organizations with significant trading activity," which is 
referred to in this Form 10-K as “U.S. Basel III proposal”. 
Under the proposal, changes to the framework would 
include replacement of the Advanced approach with an 
expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the 
use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other 
than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer 
requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-
based approach and the Standardized approach. The 
proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital 
requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or 
more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The 
proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year 
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based 
approach. Based on the Firm's understanding of the 
proposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of 
June 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data 
collection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the 
estimated impact at the end of the transition period would 
increase RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in 
an approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary 
to meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. 
These estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm 
may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently 
proposed.

Pending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the 
Firm expects that it will continue to build capital above the 
current levels, and therefore the CET1 target of 13.5% 
previously set by the Firm (which was with respect to the 
current Standardized RWA measure) is no longer 
meaningful. The Firm's quarterly capital ratios will vary 
dependent on market conditions and other factors. Under 
the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new 
expanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would 
be the Firm’s binding constraint.

The current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for 
calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the 
case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is generally calculated 
consistently between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these 
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to 

92

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

incorporate management judgment and feedback from its 
regulators.

As of December 31, 2023, the Advanced Total Capital ratio 
became the most binding constraint for the Firm’s Basel III 
risk-based ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the 
Stress Capital Buffer requirement. However, as of December 
31, 2023, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based 
ratios, the Standardized ratios are more binding than the 
Advanced ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate its SLR. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the 
Firm’s SLR became more binding than the Basel III risk-
based ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the Stress 
Capital Buffer requirement. With the increase in the GSIB 
surcharge in the first quarter of 2024, the Firm expects the 
risk-based ratios to revert to being more binding than the 
SLR.

Refer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB 
surcharge and page 98 for additional information on SLR.

Other Key Regulatory Developments 
GSIB Surcharge
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal 
to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted 
as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to 
assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the 
average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout 
the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain 
measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge 
increments would be reduced from 50 bps to 10 bps and 
there would also be other technical amendments to the 
Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would 
revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and 
other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective two calendar 
quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Risk-
based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 94-95 for 
further information on the GSIB surcharge.

TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements
In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC 
released a proposal to expand the eligible long-term debt 
("eligible LTD") and clean holding company requirements 
under the existing total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") 
rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more 
in total consolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already 
subject to these requirements, the proposal would reduce 
the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less than 
two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC 
requirement. The proposal would also expand the existing 
capital deduction framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to 
include LTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD 
requirements.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a 
“capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation 
buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary 
countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory 
capital requirements, as well as a variable SCB requirement, 
floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital 
requirements. 

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods based on data for the 
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the 
two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed 
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is 
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale 
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB 
score “multiplication factor”. 

94

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced 
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage 
buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III 
divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total 
leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total 
average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to 
be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-
balance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory capital 
rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional information.

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.

Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. must also maintain minimum capital and 
leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the 
regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt 
Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement 
Act, respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional 
information. 

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, 
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to 
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, 
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further 
information on the Firm’s current capital measures.

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 
and 2022.

On November 27, 2023, the FSB released its annual list of 
GSIBs based upon data as of December 31, 2022, which 
affirmed the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5%, 
which will be effective January 1, 2025, unless the Firm’s 
Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, is 
lower based upon data as of December 31, 2023.

The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2021 is 4.5% (up from 4.0%), which 
became effective January 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated 
Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 
31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule 
currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge 
increased to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment 
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of 
December 31, 2023, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer 
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to 
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be 
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine 
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 
12-month implementation period. 

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer to 
TLAC on page 100 for additional information.

in composition and credit quality, market movements, and deductions for excess eligible allowances for credit losses not eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 
capital; for Market risk RWA, changes in position, market movements, and changes in the Firm’s regulatory multiplier from Regulatory VaR backtesting 
exceptions; and for Operational risk RWA, updates to cumulative losses and macroeconomic model inputs. 

(c) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Basel III Standardized Credit risk RWA included wholesale and retail off balance-sheet RWA of $208.5 billion and 
$210.1 billion, respectively; and the Basel III Advanced Credit risk RWA included wholesale and retail off balance-sheet RWA of $188.5 billion and $180.8 
billion, respectively.

(d) As of December 31, 2023, Credit risk RWA reflected approximately $52.4 billion of RWA calculated under the Standardized approach for certain assets 

associated with First Republic as permitted by the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules.

(b) Adjusted average assets used for the calculation of Tier 1 leverage 

under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of 
capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, 
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2024, 
changes to the Firm’s line of business capital allocations are 
primarily a result of updates to the Firm’s current capital 
requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB under rules 
currently in effect. In addition, the capital that the Firm has 
accumulated to meet the increased requirements of the U.S. 
Basel III proposal has generally been retained in Corporate.

Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was imposed on net share repurchases 
effective January 1, 2023.

(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended share 
repurchases, which it resumed under its current common share 
repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.

(c) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common 
stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted 
and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became 
subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under 
the regulatory capital framework.

The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and alternative investment opportunities. 
The $30 billion common share repurchase program 
approved by the Board does not establish specific price 
targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be 
suspended by management at any time; and may be 
executed through open market purchases or privately 
negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, 
which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into 
from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to 
repurchase its common shares during periods when it may 
otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for 
example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other capital requirements 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt.

The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of 
eligible long-term debt requirements are shown below:

(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their 

respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result in 
limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may 
distribute, such as through dividends and common share 
repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments 
for certain executive officers.

The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and 
eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation of these 
amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total RWA and total 
leverage exposure applying the impact of the CECL capital

Management’s discussion and analysis

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that it does not 
have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of 
funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. 

Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk 
Management’s responsibilities include: 

• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; 

• Independently establishing and monitoring limits and 

indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit 

breaches; 

• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 

management processes to evaluate their adequacy and 
effectiveness; 

• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 

entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as 
well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and 
funding activities; and 

• Approving or escalating for review new or updated 

liquidity stress assumptions.

Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management 
are to:  

• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal 
entities are able to operate in support of client needs and 
meet contractual and contingent financial obligations 
through normal economic cycles as well as during stress 
events, and 

• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 

liquidity sources. 

The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 

of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs, legal 
entities, as well as currencies, taking into account legal, 
regulatory, and operational restrictions; 

• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; 

• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 

• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 

risk appetite tolerances and limits; 

• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 

related to funding and liquidity risk; and 

• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 

characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as 
well as certain off-balance sheet items. 

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach designed to:  

• Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 

• Monitor exposures; 

• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 

the Firm’s legal entities; and 

• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a 

Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, the Treasurer 
Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the 
Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the 
Board of Directors, for approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk 
tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to 
Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86–89 for further 
discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees. 

Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is 
intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal 
entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse 
scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s 
resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are 
produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are 
performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration: 

• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 

funding markets; 

• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;

• Credit rating downgrades; 

• Collateral haircuts; and 

• Potential impediments to the availability and 

transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions. 

Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time 
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both 
market and idiosyncratic stresses. 

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding to support the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels 
sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and 
minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through 

102

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

periods of stress when access to normal funding sources 
may be disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the 
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource 
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates 
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. 
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding 
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal 
entities in a period of stress. 

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating 
the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy 
certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR 
rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality 
liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. 

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 based on the Firm’s interpretation of 
the LCR framework.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared 
with the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven 
by CIB market activities, partially offset by loan growth.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three 
months ended December 31, 2023 decreased compared 
with the three months ended December 31, 2022, 
reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA 
as a result of a reduction in cash due to a decline in average 
deposits and loan growth, as well as the impact of First 
Republic and lower market values of HQLA-eligible 
investment securities. These impacts were partially offset 
by CIB markets activities.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 34 for additional information on 
the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First 
Republic acquisition.

For the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with 
the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s 
interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR 
Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023 and 
September 30, 2023 on the Firm’s website for additional 
information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor 
behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, 
including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate 
from period to period due to changes in their respective 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of 
Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to 
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
LCR.

Liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven 
by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an increase 
in unencumbered AFS securities. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had 
approximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities 
comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the 
impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 
billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable 
securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion 
and $694 billion, respectively.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of 
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Banks discount window and other central banks. Available 
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 
primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans 
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, 
the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable 
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts 
of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured 
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance 
sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term 
cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term 

debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank 
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured 
borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are 
primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO 
in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in 
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. 

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance 
sheet obligations.

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of 
funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale 
funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits 
are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, 
which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. 
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be 
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from 
customers that maintain operating service relationships with 
the Firm. 

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than period-
end deposit balances. However, during periods of market 
disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted.

Average deposits were lower for the year ended December 
31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, 
reflecting the net impact of:

• lower balances in AWM due to continued migration into 

higher-yielding investments driven by the higher interest 
rate environment, partially offset by growth from new and 
existing customers as a result of new product offerings 
and the impact of First Republic,

• a decline in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, 

largely offset by the impact of First Republic, 

• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 

clients seek higher-yielding investments, partially offset 
by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in 
the market in the first quarter of 2023,     

• a decline in CIB due to deposit attrition, including actions 
taken to reduce certain deposits, predominantly offset by

net issuances of structured notes as a result of client 
demand, and   

• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 

consumer initiatives. 

Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2022, 
reflecting the net impact of:

• higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured 
notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit 
inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and 
Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, 
including actions taken to reduce certain deposits,

• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 

consumer initiatives,

• lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer 

spending,

• a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higher-
yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate 
environment, predominantly offset by growth from new 
and existing customers as a result of new product 
offerings, and

• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 

clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly 
offset by the retention of inflows associated with 
disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.

The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits 
associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, 
AWM and CB.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that 
provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit 
to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available 
to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are 
placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection 
for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firmwide estimated 
uninsured deposits were $1,331.9 billion and $1,383.7 
billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale 
operating deposits.

Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table 
below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. 
time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s 
estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on 
data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable 
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-
U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 
2022, reflecting the impact of a lower level of netting on 
reduced repurchase activity. 

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. 

The increase in period-end commercial paper and the 
decrease in average balances for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to the respective prior year 
periods were due to changes in net issuance levels primarily 
for short-term liquidity management.

The decrease in average secured other borrowed funds for 
the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior 
year period was primarily due to lower financing of Markets 
activities.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. For the year ended 
December 31, 2023, the increase in period-end structured notes compared to the prior year period was attributable to net 
issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in fair value.

The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note 5 and Note 14 
for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023, 
were as follows:

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings 
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable 
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, 
earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a 
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and 
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management 
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies 
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, 
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk 
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as 
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the 
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate and employees to 
consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether 
to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client 
relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business 
process or consider any other activity. Environmental 
impacts and social concerns are increasingly important 
considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and 
are a component of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and 
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various 
stakeholders, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
communities, investors, regulators, or employees. 

The types of events that may result in reputation risk are 
wide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s 
employees, business strategies and activities, clients, 
customers and counterparties with which the Firm does 
business. These events could contribute to financial losses, 
litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties 
or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm. 

Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s 
LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently 
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes 
the following activities:

• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 

policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk 
framework 

• Providing oversight of the governance framework 
through processes and infrastructure to support 
consistent identification, escalation and monitoring of 
reputation risk issues Firmwide

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is 
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities 
portfolio and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages 
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk 
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management 
governance includes the following activities:

• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across 

all portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval

• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 

• Assigning and managing credit approval authorities in 

connection with the approval of credit exposure

• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and

• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 

credit risk-based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center 
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit 
losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and 
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the 
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related 
commitments and the allowance for investment securities 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical 
Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 155–158 
for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing 
process assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses 
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying 
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. 
The stress test results may indicate credit migration, 
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the 
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and country- 
specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses 
stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite 
both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact 
of stress on individual counterparties.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

111

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for: 

• Independently assessing risk grades assigned to 

exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio and the 
timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible 
business units; and 

• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management 
processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the 
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given 
default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and 
management of credit exposures, and compliance with 
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. 

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-
making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit 
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, 
risk committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process for extending credit 
so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio 
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through 
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. 
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and 
other trends against business expectations, current and 
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends 
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portfolio. 

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are 
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate 
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:

• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes

• Loan syndications and participations

• Loan sales and securitizations

• Credit derivatives

• Master netting agreements, and

• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.
In the following tables, total loans include loans retained 
(i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain 
loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do 
not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value 
and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for 
further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 
12, 28, and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s 
loans, lending-related commitments and derivative 
receivables, including the Firm’s related accounting 
policies. 
Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and 
refer to Note 11 for information regarding credit risk 
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114–119 and Note 12 
for further discussions of the consumer credit environment 
and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on 
pages 120–130 and Note 12 for further discussions of the 
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and 
disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement 
to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or 
involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure 
of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate 
reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term 
extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm 
has defined these types of modifications as financial 
difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the 
elimination of the requirement to assess whether a 
modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs 
from the population previously considered TDRs. Refer to 
Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of 
loans and lending-related commitments for residential real 
estate, credit card, scored auto and business banking, 
including those associated with First Republic, primarily in 
residential real estate. The consumer credit portfolio also 
includes loans at fair value, predominantly in residential real 
estate. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime 
segment of the consumer credit market. Originated 
mortgage loans are retained in the residential real estate 
portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies 
and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of 
consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information on the consumer 
loan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for further information on 
lending-related commitments.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2022 driven by 
residential real estate loans associated with First Republic 
and higher auto loans.

The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022 
driven by residential real estate loans associated with First 
Republic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared 
to December 31, 2022 predominantly driven by loan sales, 
partially offset by the net impact of paydowns and 
additions, including those associated with First Republic. 
Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 
2023 compared to the prior year driven by lower 
prepayments due to higher interest rates.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2022, 
driven by an increase in Home Lending as originations 
outpaced warehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases 
outpaced sales and paydowns.
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of 
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $90.6 billion 
and $36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was driven by 
First Republic. These loans have an interest-only payment 
period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-
rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are 
typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-
income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio 
is comparable with the performance of the broader prime 
mortgage portfolio.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $16.1 billion at December 31, 2023, 
which included $2.6 billion associated with First Republic. 
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that have 
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or 
have been modified and $4.3 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-

At December 31, 2023, $228.4 billion, or 70% of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was 
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and 
Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or 62% at 
December 31, 2022.
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios 
have improved, reflecting an increase in home prices.

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.

Modified residential real estate loans
For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real 
estate FDMs were $136 million. In addition to FDMs, the 
Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to trial 
modification where the terms of the loans have not been 
permanently modified, as well as $9 million of loans subject 
to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings 
("Chapter 7 loans"). The changes to the TDR accounting 
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and 
concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial 
modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, 
but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further 
information.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, residential real 
estate TDRs were $362 million. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information on TDRs in prior periods.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, generally consists of prime-
quality scored auto and business banking loans, other 
consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio 
increased when compared to December 31, 2022 due to 
originations of scored auto loans and an increase in other 
consumer unsecured fair value option loans in CIB 
associated with First Republic, largely offset by paydowns. 
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 
increased compared to the prior year due to higher charge-
offs of scored auto loans driven by the decline in used 
vehicle valuations. The scored auto net charge-off rates 
were 0.56% and 0.24% for the years ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.

Nonperforming assets

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2022 
reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving 
balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic 
levels. The December 31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, 
increased compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, 
respectively. Net charge-offs increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year as 
delinquencies have normalized.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. 

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2023, $98.1 billion, or 46% of the total 
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared 
with $85.4 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2022. 

Modifications of credit card loans
For the year ended December 31, 2023, credit card FDMs 
were $648 million. FDMs increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to credit card TDRs in the 
prior year, as delinquencies have normalized. In addition to 
FDMs, the Firm also had $27 million of loans subject to trial 
modification where the terms of the loans have not been 
permanently modified for the year ended December 31, 
2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance 
eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession 
assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were 
considered TDRs, but not FDMs.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, credit card TDRs 
were $418 million. 

Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information about 
this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, 
geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.

Management’s discussion and analysis

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 122–125 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure 
held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied 
when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm 
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate 
clients, products and services, associated with First 
Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal 
risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in 
future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 53 
for additional information.

As of December 31, 2023, retained loans increased 
$68.8 billion predominantly driven by the impact of First 
Republic. Lending-related commitments increased 
$64.8 billion, driven by the impact of First Republic, and 
net portfolio activity in CIB and CB.

As of December 31, 2023, nonperforming exposure 
increased $476 million predominantly driven by 
nonperforming retained loans in Real Estate and 
Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and Individuals largely 
driven by the impact of First Republic, partially offset by a 
single name upgrade in Civic Organizations.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, wholesale net 
charge-offs increased $698 million, predominantly driven 
by the restructuring of a loan, increases in Real Estate 
(concentrated in Office) and Consumer & Retail.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against 
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 

maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow 
profile or changes in market conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ 
definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized 
exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and $31.3 billion at 
December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.3% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the 
$41.4 billion, $38.3 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was predominantly driven by Real Estate, 
Technology, Media & Telecommunications (predominantly Technology) and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The industry of risk 
category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information 
on industry concentrations.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022. Since December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loan exposure 
increased by $319 million driven by retained loans in Real 
Estate and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and  
Individuals largely driven by the impact of First Republic, 
partially offset by a single name upgrade in Civic 
Organizations.

Modified wholesale loans 
The amortized cost of wholesale FDMs was $2.1 billion for 
the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 1 and 
Note 12 for further information. 

Wholesale TDRs were $801 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2022.

As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess 
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is 
greater than the population previously considered TDRs. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior 
periods.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The 
contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent 
the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw 
down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its 
obligations under these guarantees, and the clients 
subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these 
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have 
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired 
without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, 
the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of 
these wholesale lending-related commitments is 
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure 
or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further 
information on wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily 
liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To 
manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin 
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an 
ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash 
or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. 
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral 
maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors 
such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of 
collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the 
borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the 
fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these 
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require 
an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s 
judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm 
estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the 
collateral and probability of borrower default. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts 
receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, 
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such 
as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-
cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the 

credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks 
to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative 
contracts through the use of legally enforceable master 
netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The 
percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject 
to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot 
trades, which are not typically covered by collateral 
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared 
trades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% at 
both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, 
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and $70.9 
billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. 
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the 
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable 
master netting agreements and the related cash collateral 
held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of 
the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these 
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with 
the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the 
LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, 
which generally represents securities that do not qualify as 
high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of 
these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are 
subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and 
limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for 
each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it 
is available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for 
derivative transactions.

is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors 
may influence the nature and magnitude of these 
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations 
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with 
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages 
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit 
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three 
measures generally show that exposure will decline after 
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2023
(in billions)

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-
client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related 
credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and 
Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate 
netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a 
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly 
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the 
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm 
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a 
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit of 
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk 
management process for derivatives exposures takes into 
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.

(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a 
weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower 
than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 
2025.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses generally consists of:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets, and 

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 
was $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1 billion 
from December 31, 2022.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included  
$1.9 billion, consisting of:
• $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 

comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset 
by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The 
net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, 
including an increase in revolving balances, partially 
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net 
reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements 
in the outlook for home prices, and 

• $675 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 

activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted 
average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration 
in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an 
addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially 
offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-
related commitment portfolios.

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 

The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic 
outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the 
third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted 
unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in 
GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting 
elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening 
financial conditions. 

The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the 
TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 
1 for further information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2023, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the 
allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 84–85 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for 
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 135–143 for further 
information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk 
Committee. 

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve 
based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic 
initiatives, including the Firm’s environmental and social 
goals.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 
2023 and 2022.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal investment risk 
is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The 
Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for 
all principal investing activities that includes approval by 
executives who are independent from the investing 
businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the 
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress 
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that 
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.

134

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

 
 
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs 
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior 
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to 
determine the suitable course of action required to return 
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a 
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting 
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected 
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Firm, 
Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as 
appropriate.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 154.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:

• Maintaining a market risk policy framework

• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 

LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

• Defining, approving and monitoring limits

• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 

assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:

• Value-at-risk 

• Stress testing

• Profit and loss drawdowns 

• Earnings-at-risk

• Economic Value Sensitivity

• Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management judgment. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give 
rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the 
extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the

testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its 
market risk positions. 

As VaR model calculations require daily data and a 
consistent source for valuation, the daily market data used 
may be different than the independent third-party data 
collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation 
process. For example, in cases where market prices are not 
observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time 
series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation 
process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s 
valuation process. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
154 for information regarding model reviews and 
approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory 
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day 
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital 
rules, which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed 
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported as appropriate to various groups including senior 
management, the Board Risk Committee and regulators.  

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and 
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate 
daily changes in market values over the historical period; 
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each 
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to 
generate daily market values may be different across 
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly 
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or 
severe shifts in market conditions. 

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability 
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to 
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily 
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual 
price-based time series for these products, if available, 
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore 
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as 
the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(b) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions 
revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the 
credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those 
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based 
measures.

(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(d) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated maximum Credit Portfolio VaR, as 

well as maximum Total VaR.

2023 compared with 2022
Average Total VaR decreased by $15 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2023 when compared with the prior 
year.

The decrease was driven by reduced market volatility and 
risk reductions predominantly impacting fixed income, 
commodities and equities.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the 
daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting 
purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below 
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude 
certain components of total net revenue, such as those 
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., 
intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk 
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded 
components of total net revenue may more than offset the 
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition 
of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting 
loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, 
assuming current changes in market values are consistent 
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times 
every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR 
backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the 
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if 
the current level of market volatility is materially different 
from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of 
historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days, and 
observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of which eight 
were in the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days 
for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted 
losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the 
population of positions which comprise each metric are 
different and due to the exclusion of certain components of 
total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as 
described above. 

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide 
daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months 
and three months ended December 31, 2023. The daily 
backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the 
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of 
days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty 
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are 
displayed within the intervals that are greater than one 
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from 
the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk 
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital 
Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR 
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 

The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive 
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.  

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 

Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress 
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results 
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to 
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. 
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to 
senior management, as appropriate.  

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating 
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, 
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the 
Board Risk Committee. 

Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.

Structural interest rate risk management 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities which are included in 

VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, 
which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking 
deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities 
portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to 
the table on page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate 
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

Governance
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest rate 
risk management policy and related limits, which are 
subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury 
and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates 
the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it 
with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. 
In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the 
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing 
independent oversight and governance around assumptions 
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural 
interest rate risk, including limits related to Earnings-at-
Risk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm manages 
structural interest rate risk generally through its investment 
securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.

Key Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of 
factors, including:

• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 

assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-

balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time

• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-
term market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)

• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of 
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.

Earnings-at-Risk
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate 
risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates 
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, 

140

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
136. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from 
non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the 
Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of the hedges in 
these simulations would increase U.S. dollar sensitivities 
and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. 
dollar foreign exchange risk on page 145 for more 
information.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a 
parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-
term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve 
involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing 
long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving 
increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates 
constant or holding short-term rates constant and 
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many 
different factors, including: 

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative 
Easing that are highly uncertain and require management 
judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held 
by the Firm at any particular time could be impacted by 
actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary 
policy, including through the use of the Reverse 
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors 
that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such 
as the level of loans across the industry and competition 
for deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and 
periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk 
calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second 
quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags 

impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The 
model change incorporated observed pricing and 
customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate 
environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from 
the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer 
behavior and competition for deposits.

The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions 
used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to 
deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of 
which are especially significant in the case of consumer 
deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are 
reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk 
Committee.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 52 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are

December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 also 
reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet 
including the impact of the First Republic acquisition.

Management’s discussion and analysis

As of December 31, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to a 
parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater 
impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of 
liabilities repricing. 

Economic Value Sensitivity 
In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a 
sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 
months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity 
(“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of 
equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current 
balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and 
investment securities as well as related hedges, under 
various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with the CTC  
interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has 
established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Additional 
information on long-term debt and held to maturity 
investment securities is disclosed on page 195 in Note 2 
financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on 
the Consolidated balance sheets.

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or 
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and 
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in 
partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these 
risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 66 for additional information.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the 
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant 
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 for additional 
information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as the movement in market parameters

individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:

•

•

• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances 
placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other 
financial institutions
Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received
Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the 
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair 
value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting 
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements.

Management’s discussion and analysis

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:

• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 

consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework

• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 

stress across the Firm

• Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management

• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 

and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns

• Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for example, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an 

144

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or  
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to  
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.  

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023, and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The 
top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country. Country exposures may 
fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, 
including client activity, market flows and liquidity 
management activities undertaken by the Firm. 

The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to 
December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in cash 
placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity 
management activities undertaken by the Firm.

The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to 
December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven by a 
reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia 
due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in 
interest rates. 

The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which 
was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2023. 
This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of 
clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of 
climate change on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations 
and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver 
of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by 
the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and 
transition risk.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The LOBs and 
Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk 
management into existing governance frameworks, or 
creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.

The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are 
responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with 
information on significant climate risks and climate-related 
initiatives, as appropriate.

Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss 
associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk 
drivers include the increased frequency or severity of 
climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and 
tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers include more 
gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea level rise, 
persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in 
average ambient temperatures.

Transition risk refers to the financial and economic 
implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low-
carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible 
changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and 
shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be 
influenced by changes in the physical climate.

Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining the Firmwide 
framework and strategy for managing climate risks that 
may impact the Firm. The Climate Risk Management 
function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate 
risk considerations into existing risk management 
frameworks, as appropriate.

Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:

•

Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to 
support identification, escalation, monitoring and 
management of climate risk across the Firm

• Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing 

mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential 
climate-related financial and economic impacts to the 
Firm

•

Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and 
the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure

The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification, assessment and management of climate risks 
present in their business activities and for adherence to 
applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.

146

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber 
attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. 

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable 
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control Management 
Organization, which consists of control managers within 
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day 
execution of the CCOR Framework. 

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is 
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework 
and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. 
The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report 
to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the 
respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR 
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance 
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the 
Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control 
environment to assess circumstances in which controls have 
failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be 
required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance 
organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides 
oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may 
also perform independent assessments of significant 
operational risk events and areas of concentrated or 
emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent 
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the 
LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the 
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the 
results to senior management.

In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, including 
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational 
risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. 

The primary component of the operational risk-based 
capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency 
and severity of operational risk losses based on historical 
data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate 
operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 
99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual 
internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the 
period in which those losses were realized, and the 
calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even 
after the issues or business activities giving rise to the 
losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk capital methodology, which uses the 
Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates 
internal and external losses as well as management’s view 
of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario 
analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and 
internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the 
impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk 
capital. 

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their 
independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs 
and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through 
monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance 
independently identify areas of heightened operational risk 
and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and 
Corporate.

Business and technology resiliency risk 
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, the effects of 
climate change, power or telecommunications loss, failure 
of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, 
civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of extraordinary events 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets including staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties. The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business  
resiliency risks. The program is required to be managed in 
accordance with the Firm’s overall approach to Operational 
Risk Management, including alignment with technology, 
cybersecurity, data, physical security, crisis management, 
real estate and outsourcing programs.

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud 
risk as well as providing employee and client education and 
awareness trainings.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and 
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of 
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third 
parties to an appropriate standard of operational 
performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss 
and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party 
Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, 
monitoring, reporting and standards with respect to third-
party outsourcing risks.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and 
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the 
development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks 
appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and 
Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk 
and Compliance has established standards designed to 
ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and 
operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis 
as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes 
the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators 
against established thresholds as well as the assessment of 
different types of operational risk against stated risk 
appetite. The standards establish escalation protocols to 
senior management and to the Board of Directors.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. 
Refer to pages 151, 152, 153 and 154, respectively for 
more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and 
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select 
examples of operational risks such as business and 
technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party 
outsourcing, as well as cybersecurity, are provided below. 

War in Ukraine and Sanctions
In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and 
economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and 
Russia-associated entities and individuals by various 
governments around the world, including the authorities in 
the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and 
continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased 
operational and other risks associated with addressing 
these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this 
increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls 
reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance 
and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in 
property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict 
payments as required by the applicable regulations.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from 
misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized 
disclosure of data. 

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving 
focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to 
protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, 
software, networks, storage devices, and other technology. 
The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, 
among other things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in 
unauthorized access to confidential information, the 
destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of 
service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. 

The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue 
to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber 
attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical 
tensions. The Firm has implemented measures and controls 
reasonably designed to address this evolving environment, 
including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the Firm 
continues to review and enhance its capabilities to address 
associated risks, such as those relating to the management 
of administrative access to systems.

Third parties with which the Firm does business, that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply 
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) or that the Firm has acquired are 
also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party 
incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, 
misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber 
attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain 
compromises, could have a material adverse effect on the 
Firm, including in circumstances in which an affected third 
party is unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
where the incident delivers compromised software to the 
Firm or results in lost or compromised information of the 
Firm or its clients or customers.

Clients and customers are also sources of cybersecurity risk 
to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when 
their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own 
security and control systems. The Firm engages in periodic 
discussions with its clients, customers and other external 
parties concerning cybersecurity risks including 
opportunities to improve cybersecurity.

Risks from cybersecurity threats, including any previous 
cybersecurity events, have not materially affected the Firm 
or its business strategy, results of operations or financial 
condition. Notwithstanding the comprehensive approach 
that the Firm takes to address cybersecurity risk, the Firm 
may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a future 
cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse 
effect on the Firm or its business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition.

Organization and management 
The Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) 
reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a 
member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The CISO 
leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization, which is responsible for identifying technology 
and cybersecurity risks and for implementing and 
maintaining controls to manage cybersecurity threats. The 
CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information Security 
Program, which is designed to prevent, detect and respond 
to cyber attacks in order to help safeguard the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm's 
infrastructure, resources and information. The program 
includes managing the Firm’s global cybersecurity 
operations centers, providing training, conducting 
cybersecurity event simulation exercises, implementing the 
Firm’s policies and standards relating to technology risk 
and cybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed, 
the Firm’s cybersecurity capabilities. 

The Firm’s Information Security Program includes the 
following functions:

Cyber Operations, which is responsible for implementing 
and maintaining controls designed to detect and defend the 
Firm against cyber attacks, and includes a dedicated 
function for incident response and ongoing monitoring for 
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, including those 
among the Firm’s third-party suppliers.

Technology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is 
responsible for operationalizing technology risk and control 
frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments that may 
impact the Firm, and developing control catalogs and 
assessments of controls, as well as overseeing governance 
and reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.

Security Awareness, which provides awareness and training 
that reinforces information risk and security management 
practices and compliance with the Firm's policies, standards 
and practices. The training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. The Firm also provides specialized security training to  
employees in specific roles, such as application developers. 
The Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees 
to take periodic training on data privacy that focuses on 
confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.

Technology Resiliency, which establishes control 
requirements for planning and testing the prioritized 
recovery of technology services in the event of degradation 
or outage, including incident response planning, data 
backup and retention, and recovery readiness in support of 
the Firmwide Business Resiliency Program and operational 
risk management practices.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan 
designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted 
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate with law 
enforcement and other government agencies, notify clients 
and customers, as applicable, and recover from such 
incidents. In addition, the Firm actively partners with 
appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and 
peer industry forums, participating in discussions and 
simulations to assist in understanding the full spectrum of 
cybersecurity risks and in enhancing defenses and 
improving resiliency in the Firm’s operating environment.

Governance and oversight
The governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity and 
Technology Controls organization is designed to 
appropriately identify, escalate and mitigate cybersecurity 
risks. Cybersecurity risk management and its governance 
and oversight are integrated into the Firm’s operational risk 
management framework, including through the escalation 
of key risk and control issues to management and the 
development of risk mitigation plans for heightened risk 
and control issues. IRM independently assesses and 
challenges the activities and risk management practices of 
the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization related to the identification, assessment, 
measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As 
needed, the Firm engages third-party assessors or auditing 
firms with industry-recognized expertise on cybersecurity 
matters to review specific aspects of the Firm’s 
cybersecurity risk management framework, processes and 
controls.

The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk 
management includes governance forums that inform 
management of key areas of concern regarding the 
prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of 
cybersecurity risks. 

The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating 
Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal management 
committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and 
management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight of 
the implementation and maintenance of appropriate 
controls in support of the Firm’s Information Security 
Program. The membership of the CTOC includes senior 
representatives from the Global Cybersecurity and 
Technology Controls organization and relevant corporate 
functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. CTOC members 
have extensive experience and qualifications in various 
technology and information security disciplines, including 
relevant experience at the Firm, at other financial services 
companies or in other highly-regulated industries. 

The CTOC escalates key operational risk and control issues, 
as appropriate, to the Global Technology Operating 
Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control committee or to 
the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees. 
The GTOC is responsible for the governance of the Firmwide 
Global Technology organization, including oversight of 
Firmwide technology strategies, the delivery of technology 
and technology operations, the effective use of information 
technology resources, and monitoring and resolving key 
operational risk and control matters arising in the Global 
Technology organization.

As part of its oversight of management’s implementation 
and maintenance of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors receives periodic 
updates from the CIO, the CISO and senior members of the 
CTOC concerning cybersecurity matters. These updates 
generally include information regarding cybersecurity and 
technology developments, the Firm’s Information Security 
Program and recommended changes to that program, 
cybersecurity policies and practices, and ongoing initiatives 
to improve information security, as well as any significant 
cybersecurity incidents and the Firm's efforts to address 
those incidents. The Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee assist the Board in this oversight.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 

Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global 
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite.

Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of 
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent 
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, and 
jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products 
and services, relationships and interactions with clients and 
customers, and employee activities. For example, 
compliance risks include those associated with anti-money 
laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, 
and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related 
to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional 
borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s 
fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the 
applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of 
fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients 
and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and 
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the CCOR Management Framework. 
The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to 
the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on 
significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate. 

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity, at all times. The Code provides 
the principles that help govern employee conduct with 
clients, customers, suppliers, vendors, shareholders, 
regulators, other employees, as well as with the markets 
and communities in which the Firm operates. The Code 
requires employees to promptly report any potential or 
actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or 
regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires 
employees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, or 
conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, 
by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, clients, 
customers, suppliers, contract or temporary workers, or 
business partners or agents. Training is assigned to newly 
hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current 
employees periodically thereafter. Employees are required 
to affirm their compliance with the Code annually. 

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the “Hotline”) 
by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, where 
permitted by law, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services and is administered by an outside 
service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against 
anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith or 
assists with an inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to 
unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of 
the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or 
the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The Business 
Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected 
to conduct themselves. With the Business Principles serving 
as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations 
for each employee and provides information and resources 
to help employees conduct business ethically and in 
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk 
Management on page 151 for further discussion of the 
Code.

Governance and oversight
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
conduct risk through the CCOR Management Framework.

The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the 
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of 
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm 
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of 
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program 
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's 
employee conduct framework and reviewing the 
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and 
each designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics 
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides 
conduct education as appropriate.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the 
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In 
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which 
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have 
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. 

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk 
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s 
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on 
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors 
and to the Audit Committee. 

Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises 
the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk 
issues.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm. 

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services 
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing 
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:

• managing actual and potential litigation and 

enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters

•

•

advising on products and services, including contract 
negotiation and documentation

advising on offering and marketing documents and new 
business initiatives

• managing dispute resolution

•

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them

advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated 
and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and 

• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the 

Board.

Management’s discussion and analysis

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. 

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making 
business decisions. A dedicated independent function, 
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and 
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of 
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and 
analysis. 

The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach which is used for models, as described in detail 
below. 

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
LOBs and Corporate based on the specific purposes of such 
models. Users and developers of models are responsible for 
developing, implementing and testing their models, as well 
as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once 
models have been approved, model users and developers 
are responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model 
users and developers may seek to enhance models in 
response to changes in the relevant portfolios and in 
product and market developments, as well as to capture 
improvements in available modeling techniques and 
systems capabilities. 

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR 
considers whether the model is suitable for the specific 
purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, 
MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and 
the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may 
perform or require additional testing, including back-testing 
of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the 
appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the 
relevant model tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as 
material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In 
certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environments are significantly 
different from the historical environments upon which the 
models were developed. This increased uncertainty may 
necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to 
inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model 
outputs than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the 
Firm may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates 
if assets acquired differ from those used to develop the 
models.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 155–158 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses generally comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information 
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest 
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. 

unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. 
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, 
U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans 
acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of 
May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating 
methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the 
ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance 
for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was 
measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm 
with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled 
estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is 
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis 
below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all 
of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s 
modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is 
predominantly residential real estate that has more 
commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to 
value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in 
the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 131 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment 
rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the eight-
quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 
2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP 
with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3% lower at the 
end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of

Management’s discussion and analysis

approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024; and 
lower HPI with a peak difference of approximately 17.9% in 
the third quarter of 2025.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
• The allowance as of December 31, 2023, reflects credit 

losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario 
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables. 

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition 

and borrower behavior can significantly affect the 
allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the 
exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $850 million for residential 

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $3.1 billion for credit card 

loans

• An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2023.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The 
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, estimated market cost of 
equity, as well as actual business results and projections of 
business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of 
December 31, 2023. For each of the reporting units, fair 
value exceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there was 
no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment 
based on current projections and valuations. 

The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent 
with management’s current business outlook assumptions 
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-
term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where 
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to 
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2023.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor 
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be 
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion 
and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was predominantly driven by continued 
growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain 
reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) 
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption 
is used to estimate the number of points earned by 
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the 
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of 
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated 
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder

deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a 
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, 
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or 
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not 
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2023, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when new information becomes available, including 
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with 
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain 
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective income 
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. 
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are 
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the 
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and 
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these 
amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for 
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is 
made.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax 
provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent 
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally 
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and 
the global tax implications are known, which could impact 
the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income 
taxes.

estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

Management’s discussion and analysis

redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates 
to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of 
December 31, 2023, a combined increase of 25 basis 
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the 
rewards liability by approximately $376 million.

Income taxes 
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems 
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the 
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes 
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business 
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate 
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.

Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and 
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income 
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined 
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred 
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the 
provision for income taxes in the period enacted.

The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including 
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax 
planning strategies, including strategies that may be 
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In 
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or 
the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or 
under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar 
functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of 
Directors, management and other personnel, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. 
GAAP”).

JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the 
assessment, management used the “Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”).

Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase’s 
internal control over financial reporting was effective based 
upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon 
management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there 
were no material weaknesses in its internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which 
appears herein.
